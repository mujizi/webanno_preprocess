The method according to the invention will be explained in more detail by way of the following examples:
EXAMPLE 1
Preparation of a factor-VII-concentrate: 1 l of fresh-frozen human citrated plasma was thawed at 0.degree. to 2.degree. C., the resulting cryoprecipitate being separated by centrifugation. In the supernatant (cryo-supernatant) containing factor VII, 7 units of fast reacting (avid) antithrombin per ml (7 AT.sub.av -U/ml) were formed in situ by the addition of 0.5 International Units (I.U.) of heparin per ml. After 15 minutes, 0.5 g of DEAE-Sephadex (diethylaminoethyl-group containing cross-linked dextrane) were added to the cryo-supernatant on stirring: after further stirring for 30 minutes at a temperature of no more than 5.degree. C. the DEAE-Sephadex was separated by sedimentation or centrifugation. In the DEAE-Sephadex-supernatant, 7 AT.sub.av -U/ml were again formed in situ by the addition of 0.5 I.U. of heparin/ml. After 15 minutes, 7 ml of a 5% suspension of aluminum hydroxide were added to the DEAE-Sephadex-supernatant on stirring; after further 15 minutes of stirring at a temperature of below 5.degree. C. the aluminum hydroxide was separated by centrifugation. The aluminum hydroxide, containing factor VII in adsorbed form, now was treated with 100 ml (1/10 of the original plasma volume) of a washing solution containing 4 g/l of trisodium citrate.2H.sub.2 O and 7 g/l of sodium chloride. Furthermore, 10 units/ml of preformed avid antithrombin (10 AT.sub.av -U/ml) were added to the solution. The preformation of the avid antithrombin, i.e. of the antithrombin-III-cofactor-complex, took place outside the fractionation-process proper, by the combination of a solution of purified antithrombin III and a heparin solution, wherein, in the resulting solution, 0.5 units of purified antithrombin III and 0.5 I.U. of heparin per ml were contained. After 10 minutes of stirring at 5.degree. C., the washed aluminum hydroxide was separated by centrifugation and factor VII was eluted at an increased ionic strength. For this purpose, the aluminum hydroxide was treated with 50 ml (1/20 of the original plasma volume) of an elution solution containing 45 g/l of secondary sodium phosphate (Na.sub.2 HPO.sub.4.12H.sub.2 O) and 4 g/l of trisodium citrate.2H.sub.2 O as well as 10 units/ml of avid antithrombin (10 AT.sub.av -U/ml) preformed in this solution. The preformation of the antithrombin-III-cofactor-complex was performed as described above. The pH of the elution solution was adjusted to 8.5 by an acid phosphate solution (78 g/l of NaH.sub.2 PO.sub.4.2H.sub.2 O). After 20 minutes of stirring at 5.degree. C. the aluminum hydroxide was separated by centrifugation and discarded. The eluate containing factor VII was adjusted to a pH of 7.5 with the acid phosphate solution and then dialyzed at 5.degree. C. against demineralized water.
The dialyzed eluate was subjected to a first lyophilization; the bulk thus obtained was tested for the factor-VII-content as well as for the presence of activated coagulation factors by means of the "NAPTT"-(NON-ACTIVATED PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN-TIME)-test described in the following, and for activated factor VII (factor VIIa), which is not detected by the NAPTT-test.
