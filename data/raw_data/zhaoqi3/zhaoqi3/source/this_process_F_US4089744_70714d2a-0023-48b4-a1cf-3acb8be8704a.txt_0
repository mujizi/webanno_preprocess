The stored hot water from (1) is directed successively through conduits 5-5C to reversible pumps 6.fwdarw.6C (these pumps are optional) and from 6-6C to conduits 7-7C for introduction into flash drums/condensers (8-8C) wherein the hot water is successively flashed at successively lower pressures to yield steam at decreasing pressure and residual water at decreasing temperature. This water is combined with the hot water moving in cascade fashion from condensers 13 to 13C. At the last flash drum/condenser the water which remains and which cannot be flashed to steam is directed through conduit 20 to conduit 21 for passing through coolers, which may be air coolers 22 and then through conduits 24 through reversible pump 23 to storage in cold water storage means (2). The steam from the different flash drums 7-7C is fed by conduits 9-9C to the compressor/turbine 10 at varying stages. Compressor/turbine 10 is driven by excess power drawn from the power grid which excess power is used to run the motor/generator 11 which in turn drives the compressor/turbine. Steam compressed at different pressures within the compressor/turbine 10 by means of excess grid power is directed through conduits 12-12C to heat exchanger means 13-13C wherein the high temperature steam from the compressor/turbine 10 is contacted by direct or indirect heat exchanger with cold oil drawn from storage means 3 and directed through conduit 14 to heat exchangers 13-13C. At the heat exchangers the cold oil is heated by contacting with the high temperature compressed steam. This heating is conducted so that the oil is being heated with steam of continuously higher condensing temperature. The condensate from each successive heat exchanger is directed cascade fashion to successively lower temperature exchanges through conduits 15-15B and optional reversible pumps 16-16B. In this manner, maximum heating efficiency is achieved. The hot oil in conduit 14 after passage through the last heat exchanger is directed to storage means 4. The condensate from the last heat exchanger is directed through conduit 17 and reversible pump 18 to hot water storage means 1 or to flash drum 8.
During periods of peak power demand all flows are reversed, the hot oil being used to heat water in the heat exchanger to produce steam of varying pressure which steam is fed to a turbine to generate electrical power. The spent steam is led to condensers where it is converted to hot water, at the same time heating cold water being pumped from cold water tank to hot water tank 1 through condensers 8C to 8. Hot water is stored for use during low power demand periods.
This system has the major advantage of being completely independent of the location of the power station since the excess power which is stored is electrical power coming off the grid which power is converted indirectly to heat by running a compressor. By this means the storage facility can be located a considerable distance from the power station; the storage facility can be sited at the very heart of the peak demand load center. Furthermore, the facility is completely independent of the source of the power. The power can be generated by hydroelectric, nuclear, solar, fossil fuel, tidal, geothermal, fusion, etc., stations. As long as the power is in the form of electricity it can be stored by utilization of this process.
The heat pump energy storage-energy retrieval system can also be located close to the electricity source. When this is done, the LVP thermal energy heat retention material is heated by means of turbine extraction steam and primary high pressure steam as described in Ser. No. 533,263, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,998,695 and Ser. No. 613,754, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,003,786. The stored hot LVP thermal energy retention material can be used either to preheat boiler feed water (as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 3,998,695 and 4,003,786) or it can be used to generate steam to run a turbine (as taught as the second step of the instant process), or both processes can be practiced simultaneously. It should be noted that when the heat pump facility is located close to an electricity source, the equipment of the heat pump facility is available as an auxiliary electricity generating station. In the event the neighboring primary electricity source is forced to shut down, the heat pump facility can then function as described in the instant specification, drawing electric power from the main power grid converting it to heat, storing said heat and reconverting the stored heat into electricity during periods of peak power demand.
In an alternative embodiment an independent intermediate loop can be employed between the stored, moving hot water-cold water circuit and the stored moving hot LVP material-cold LVP material circuit. Referring to Diag. II, during charging, the stored hot water is contacted in heat exchanger means with an independent intermediate heat transfer fluid such as freon, ammonia, propane, propylene, butane, pentane, water, i.e. any thermal fluid which has characteristics compatible with compression means-expansion means operations. This thermal fluid in the independent circuit is vaporized by its contact with the hot water and is compressed in the compression means which is run by a motor powered by excess electricity drawn from the power grid. This compressed vapor, now at a higher temperature, is contacted in heat exchanger means with an LVP organic thermal energy retention material moving through said exchanger means on its passage from cold to hot storage means. During periods of peak power demand the hot LVP material is transported to cold storage means through heat exchanger means wherein the hot LVP material is contacted, directly or indirectly, in heat exchanger means with the intermediate heat transfer fluid previously described moving through the independent intermediate loop thereby transferring heat to said fluid and evaporating it at elevated pressure. Said fluid thereupon is conducted to a heat engine whereby its thermal energy is converted to mechanical energy which is used to power a generator resulting in the production of electricity. The intermediate heat transfer fluid transfers its residual heat (usually in the form of latent heat) to water in heat exchanger means whereby said water is heated and stored for use during nonpeak periods as disclosed above.
