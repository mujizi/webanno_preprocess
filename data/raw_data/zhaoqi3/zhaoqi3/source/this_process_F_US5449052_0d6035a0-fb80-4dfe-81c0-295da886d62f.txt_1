The one-way coupling 24 does not engage in the brake-release direction, wherein (during brake release) until the engaging pin 26 engages the other side of the slot 32 the compression spring 28 exerts the necessary holding torque on the bushing 22, the ring 20, and the adjusting shaft 16 (in consequence of the axial play between the bushing 22 and the sleeve 25)--and the lever member 31, via engaging pin 26, merely rotates the sleeve 25 to its (the sleeve's) initial position. During this movement all of the other parts of the adjusting mechanism remain unengaged (by the sleeve 25).
There is a hazard that when the brake is in a released state the sleeve 25 and pin 26 can be moved out of their rest position due to vibrations or the like, which would lead to a spurious defeat of the free play S. To prevent this, the required holding torque is exerted on the sleeve 25 by the spring ring 29 or equivalent means. As mentioned above, to suitably accomplish this purpose, the force of the spring ring 29 is less than that of the compression spring 28. This condition must also be fulfilled during the brake release process, in order to avoid undesired reverse movement of the adjusting shaft 16, the ring 20, and the bushing 22.
When the brake is retracted, e.g. to change a brake pad, the adjusting shaft 16 is rotated by a tool, via a tool-engaging projection 33, whereby the thrust spindle 10 is returned to its initial position. In this process, the fixed ring 20 serves as a "stop piece" for the thrust spindle, which prevents pressing of the adjusting piece against the cover 13 which is attached to the caliper housing. In this way it is assured that in the subsequent brake application process, the adjusting can be easily effected and the axial yielding during de-coupling (i.e. overrunning of the toothed coupling 23) can occur.
