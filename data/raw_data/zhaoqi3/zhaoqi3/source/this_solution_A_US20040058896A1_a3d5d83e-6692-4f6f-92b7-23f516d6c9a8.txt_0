[0416] Examples of active ingredient units of the invention contain 5-40% pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, 10-40% cetyl alcohol, 5-60% solid paraffin, 1-5% polymer and 0.1-0.2% of a basic compound. Further examples of active ingredient units of the invention contain 540% pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, 10-40% glyceryl tripalmitate, 5-60% solid paraffin, 1-5% polymer and 0.1-0.2% of a basic compound. Other examples of active ingredient units of the invention contain 5-40% pantoprazole sodium sesqulhydrate, 10-40% glyceryl tripalmitate, 5-60% solid paraffin, 1-5% polymer and 0.1-0.2% of a basic compound. Still other examples of active ingredient units of the invention contain 10-20% pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, 20-40% triglyceride, 40-70% solid paraffin, 1-5% sterol and 0.05-0.1% of a basic compound.
[0417] The individual active ingredient units can be produced for example by spray drying or, preferably, by spray solidification, in particular also by spray prilling. Production is particularly preferably by prilling, in particular by vibration prilling.
[0418] For the spray solidification or prilling expediently the matrix excipients are liquefied to give a melt. The active ingredient is dissolved or dispersed in this solution, and the resulting solution or dispersion is sprayed or, preferably, prilled in a suitable apparatus. A dispersion of the active ingredient in a melt of the exciplents is preferably used.
[0419] Spray solidification takes place in a manner known per se. A detailed description of this technique is to be found in P. B. Deasy, Microencapsulation and Related Drug Processes (1984).
[0420] The individual active ingredient units are particularly preferably produced by solidification from liquid phase by generating drops by means of vibrating nozzles and by solidifying the drops which are formed, after they have stabilized, by drying or cooling in a suitable medium (preferably gaseous or liquid). The suitable medium may be, for example, cooled gas such as air or nitrogen. Processes of this type and corresponding apparatuses are disclosed in DE 27 25 924, EP 0 467 221, WO99/33555 and WO00/24382.
