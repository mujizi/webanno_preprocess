Catalyst Preparation by Evaporative Procedure
In a typical preparation according to the present invention, Zr and Ce nitrate salts are dissolved in 300 grams of deionized water. Of course, other suitable Zr or Ce salts can be used as well as other metals besides Ce or Zr or in conjunction with Ce or Zr. Sufficient compatible organic depositing reagent such as citric acid (of course, any other suitable organic reagent can be used in place of citric acid) is then added to the metal salt solution to give a citric acid to metal salt mole ratio of about 2 or higher. 200 grams of .gamma.-Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 (or another suitable support) are then added to this solution, and the overall mixture blended for 10 minutes and thereafter evaporated to dryness. The resultant powder is then calcined at 600.degree. C. for 6 hours in 4%O.sub.2 /96%N.sub.2 followed by 1 hour in air at 600.degree. C. The powders are formed into a cake and then sieved to 20-40 mesh and Pt+Rh thereafter added at a loading of 0.8 wt. % and Pt to Rh weight ratio of 5:1. The samples will be finally calcined at 600.degree. C. in air followed by aging at 1140.degree. C. for about 5-7 hours in 10%H.sub.2 O/90%N.sub.2.
In like manner, Ce,Zr/.gamma.-Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 samples have been prepared where the composition and the Ce/Zr ratio were varied. For one series of Ce/Zr samples, the total moles of Ce+Zr used in the preparation was kept constant at 0.4 moles and the Ce/Zr mole ratio varied from about 3:1 to about 1:3 (actual ratios used were 2.7, 0.9 and 0.33 to 1.0). Blank .gamma.-Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 samples were also prepared in which only Zr and/or Ce was used and in which the amount of Zr and/or Ce used was 0.2 moles. Samples were also prepared where the mixed Zr and Ce nitrate salts were precipitated using the conventional NH.sub.4 OH co-precipitation procedure used in the prior art.
