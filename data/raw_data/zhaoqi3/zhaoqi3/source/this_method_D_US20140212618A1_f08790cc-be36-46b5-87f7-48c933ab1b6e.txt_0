[0002] This invention relates to a printed textile substrate, such as a floorcovering article, and a process for making a printed textile substrate. The printed textile substrate contains areas of low viscosity printing ink and high viscosity printing ink. The process for making the textile substrate includes a one pass manufacturing step that results in a textile substrate having areas of low viscosity and high viscosity printing inks.
BACKGROUND
[0003] Printed textile substrates, such as floorcovering articles, have been historically dyed and/or printed via several printing processes. In some instances, floorcovering articles are printed using a fluid dyer wherein the article, such as a carpet tile, is submerged within a dye bath to create a solid color shade on the surface of the article. The article may then be subjected to a second pass down the manufacturing range in order to overprint a design on the surface of the article using high viscosity printing inks. This two-step process is time consuming and expensive. In other instances, floorcovering articles are printed with a digital printing machine that uses high viscosity printing inks in order to make a pattern on the surface of the articles. Floorcovering articles, such as carpet tiles, made according to this method lack the ability to provide solid shades and tile to tile edge matching.
[0004] In yet another instance, solution dyed yarn is used to manufacture the floorcovering article and then a pattern may be printed on the surface of the article using high viscosity printing inks. This process is undesirable because the base color of the article must be predetermined when the article is manufactured and cannot be changed. The prior art processes utilize high viscosity printing inks due to the nature of the printing machine and need to prevent the printing ink from bleeding when it contacts the surface of the floorcovering article. If the ink is of low viscosity (e.g. less than 15 cp), then the ink will begin to migrate and bleed into areas where coloration is not desired. In order to prevent this from occurring, floorcovering manufacturers utilize printing inks having a sufficiently high viscosity such that the inks are properly placed in a certain location on the surface of the floorcovering article.
[0005] Thus, further improvements in the printing of textile substrates, such as floorcovering articles, are needed that can be achieved with one pass down the printing range and that provide excellent solid color shades and patterns. The utilization of several new process steps that will be described herein and the combination of low and high viscosity printing inks results in a printed textile substrate that solves the prior art problems of color separation at the yarn and fiber dimension and provides patterns and designs that were previously unachievable.
