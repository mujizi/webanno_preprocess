The quick fastener according to the invention comprises a damping rubber which encloses and connects an injection molding with a longitudinal or elongated wire and a cable sleeve with a guide tube. The damping rubber may be constructed in various ways and made from various materials. According to the invention, it is surrounded by a housing and a closure piece and held together in such a way that the guide tube and cable sleeve cannot be detached.
A movable pressure piece is arranged on the housing. This movable pressure piece engages in a wedge-shaped ramp contour of the housing and can accordingly be fixedly connected with the housing, which is effected by means of torsion springs between the housing and the pressure piece. The side remote of the torsion spring and ramp contour of the pressure piece presses by spring force against the abutment to which the quick fastener is fastened.
At the other side of the abutment, a closure piece is arranged at the quick fastener and acts against the abutment by its collar, holds the damping rubber securely in its interior and locks into a recess in the housing by its snap-in projections and is accordingly securely connected with it. To fasten the quick fastener to the abutment, the pressure piece need only be turned against the spring force and pulled back proceeding from one side. In order to facilitate this process for the user, a spacer can be inserted between the closure piece and the pressure piece in place of the abutment prior to mounting, wherein the spacer falls out by pressing on the abutment.
The quick fastener according to the invention can be mounted quickly, simply and in a space-saving manner from one side with little effort.
It is important to the invention that at least two ramp contours are arranged on the pressure piece and the housing. Of course, it is also possible to arrange only one ramp contour or more than two ramp contours. A torsion spring is arranged between the pressure piece and the housing in such a way that the pressure piece is pretensioned such that it is supported at the ramp contour or at the housing and an axial movement can therefore be carried out. Accordingly, the parts can be disengaged by means of a simple rotating movement of the closure piece or housing relative to the pressure piece, so that the spring is tensioned. A quick, secure and user-friendly pretensioning of the parts relative to one another, wherein a fastening to the abutment is carried out, is effected by means of the force of the tensioned spring which screws tight the parts relative to one another to the extent allowed by the ramp-shaped contour at the end sides which limit these movements.
