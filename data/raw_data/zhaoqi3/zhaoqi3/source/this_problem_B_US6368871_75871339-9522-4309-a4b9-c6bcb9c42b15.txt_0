This invention addresses certain aspects of controlling, moving, or otherwise manipulating fluids on a microscale. Microfluidic systems that may be useful for fully automated biochemical analysis require that specific functionalities such as volume measuring, fluid mixing, heating, liquid phase separation, and others, be incorporated into microfluidic circuits. They must be designed to overcome microscale effects, such as low Reynolds numbers, that make conventional macroscopic design approaches ineffective.
Mixing of fluids is a common and critical event in most biochemical analytical protocols. On a conventional macroscale, there are various effective means, including pipettes, vortexing devices, or aspirating/dispensing robotics, to effect mixing of two or more fluids. However, it is well known that mixing of fluids in microfluidic systems is difficult. The problem stems from the fact that the Reynolds numbers are typically so small (less than 100) in most microfluidic systems, that the flows are virtually always laminar. Reynolds number is ([density*velocity*channel-width]/viscosity); in microfluidic systems, the channel width is so small that the Reynolds number is small. In macroscopic systems, Reynolds numbers must be above about 2300 before turbulence begins. Since fluid flow is virtually never turbulent in microfluidic systems, mixing occurs almost entirely by diffusion. Mixing by diffusion can be very slow. One example is that of a 300 .mu.m deep by 600 .mu.m wide "zigzagging" channel, which fully mixed only after a flow length of 100 mm.
Various schemes have been proposed to overcome this problem. In the device of Branebjerg a unique micromachined geometry two totally overlapping flows are merged. Because of the two thin ribbons of fluid, the characteristic diffusion length for mixing is now 15 .mu.m instead of 150 .mu.m, and diffusion mixing now occurs much more rapidly. In this approach, however, only two channels can be brought together and the total interfacial surface area is limited to the width and length of the channels in the mixing region. To effect mixing under conditions of fast flow-rates, a significant increase in the width of both the individual channels, or an increase in the length of the mixing region, or both, is required. In these cases, the total micromachined device area and cost will be increased.
Besides mixing, other techniques are required in biochemical analysis. For example, one well-accepted technique for extracting proteins and other hydrophobic chemicals from aqueous solutions containing biological compounds is liquid phase separation. Proteins, normally present in high concentration in aqueous biological solutions such as serum, plasma, and tissue homogenates, are structurally composed of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains which together determine their secondary and tertiary structure as a function of the solvent in which they are dissolved. Through the hydrophobic domains are usually much larger than the hydrophilic domains, stable structures are achieved in polar solvents when the hydrophobic domains self-associate in the core of the globular structure and the hydrophilic are exposed to the solvent. This satisfies the difference in Gibbs free energy states between folded and unfolded structures as a function of the solvent properties. However, conditions can be produced in the aqueous phase such that in most cases, limited only by extremes of salt concentration and pH or presence of denaturants or detergents, a lower Gibbs free energy state for the protein can be achieved in non-polar solvents, such as alcohols, various alkanes, and chloroform.
The preferential partitioning, migration or diffusion of proteins from polar to non-polar solvents can be exploited to extract proteins from polar-based biological samples. When a non-polar liquid, for example chloroform, is added to a water-based solution, the fluids will not mix, but will remain in two immiscible phases. The less dense non-polar phase will rise to and remain as a separate layer on top of the polar phase. A small number of proteins in the polar phase can undergo a change in tertiary structure and move across the boundary between the two phases because they favor the lower energy state associated with being dissolved in the non-polar phase. Over a very long period of time, the polar phase becomes depleted of proteins. If the immiscible fluids are vigorously agitated, the solutions will form an emulsion. In such an emulsion, the non-polar phase will form into a very large number of small droplets, surrounded by and evenly distributed throughout the polar phase, for example. This effectively dramatically increases the surface area between the two phases for the interaction of the proteins with the non-polar phase and their diffusion into the non-polar phase. The rate of movement of proteins into the non-polar phase can also be enhanced by varying the conditions in the polar phase which decreases their structural stability in the polar phase. The presence of high salt concentration, detergents, phenol, and/or chaotropes can decrease the stability of the folded state of proteins in the polar phase. After the emulsion is allowed to stand still for some time without agitation, or with assistance by increased relative centrifugal force (if there is a density difference between the two phases), the two phases will eventually separate again, with the non-polar phase forming a layer over the top of the polar phase. Now, the non-polar phase is highly concentrated with proteins and the polar phase is depleted of proteins. If the original protein concentration is very high, residual proteins may still be present in the polar phase due to back diffusion, and fresh non-polar solvent must be added and the separation repeated. Similar phase separation methods have been used to separate proteins from water-based biological solutions for many years.
