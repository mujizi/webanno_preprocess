[0006] In such an OFDM receiver system, it is possible to apply adaptive beamforming weights at various points in a receiver as shown in FIG. 1. However, the effectiveness of these weightings will largely depend on the stability and coherency of the propagation channel. If the channel undergoes flat fading (i.e. the signal strength of each of the sub-carriers is affected to the same extent), then it can be regarded as being a narrowband channel. In this case, a single set of weights can be applied at radio frequency (RF) or intermediate frequency (IF), to the received signal just after the antenna array 21, i.e. at position (1) in FIG. 1. Alternatively, the weights may be applied after the analogue to digital unit 22 at position (2) in FIG. 1. Both of these positions should be sufficient for optimum spatial processing.
[0007] However, in wideband systems, operating at high data rates such as WLAN, WPAN, etc., where bandwidths of 10 MHz or higher may be required and/or systems operating in highly dispersive environments, signals will occupy a spectrum in excess of the coherence bandwidth. Consequently, there will be significant variation in the quality/signal strength of the channels across the bandwidth. Consequently, it is unlikely that a single set of weights (i.e. as in narrowband beamforming) would be satisfactory for beamforming.
[0008] One way to overcome this problem is to process the received data and apply weightings in the receiver for each sub-carrier, after the FFT 24, i.e. at position (3). FIG. 2 shows an example of a receiver. In this system, the signal is received by antennas 101,102,103. Pre-processing units 104,105,106, carry out downconversion, A to D conversion, serial to parallel conversion and FFT processing. The outputs are then fed into an array of adaptive signal processing devices 107,108,109 which include a plurality of multipliers 110 which multiply each of the received signals by a weighting value w determined by a weight determining unit 113. Each of the weighted signals from the multipliers is then summed 111 to provide an output signal. The output signals from each of the weighting units is then fed to a combining unit 112 which extracts a data signal in which the delayed signals and interference signals have been removed from the received signal.
[0009] However, in the example shown, the receiver has L antennas and the number of sub-channels that each antenna receives is N. Therefore, the total number of weighting units required is L.times.N. This can lead to a very large number of multipliers 110 being required. For example, in the HIPERLAN system, there are 48 data sub-carriers and 4 pilot sub-carriers (N=52); there is also a DC channel (CH0) which does not carry data. This means that the receiver is complicated and this results in the receiver being expensive and potentially subject to reliability problems. In addition, the weighting is normally implemented in software and so processor demand is extremely high, again resulting in high expense or poor performance. If the processing to determine the weighting to be applied is unduly complex, then it may take a significant amount of time to complete. During this time, the channel parameters may have changed significantly and so the calculated weightings could be inappropriate. Under these circumstances, the weighting produced would always out of date and hence poor performance will result where the characteristics of the channel change rapidly with time.
[0010] One way to reduce the processor demand, is to divide the operating bandwidth into a number of sub-bands and then select one sub-carrier from within each sub-band on which to base all calculations. This method relies upon each sub-band behaving generally as a narrowband, i.e. that the sub-band effectively undergoes flat fading. In other words the chosen sub-carrier is accurately representative of the fade within the sub-band as a whole. However, without prior knowledge of the operational environment, it is difficult to know to what extent the operating band should be divided up. Where large sub-bands are chosen there is a danger that the chosen sub-carrier would not be sufficiently representative of the sub-band and performance would be degraded. In contrast, if the number of sub-bands is chosen to be large (i.e. few carriers per sub-band), whilst the representative sub-carrier is likely to be accurately representative of the sub-band, the amount of processing required is disadvantageously high.
