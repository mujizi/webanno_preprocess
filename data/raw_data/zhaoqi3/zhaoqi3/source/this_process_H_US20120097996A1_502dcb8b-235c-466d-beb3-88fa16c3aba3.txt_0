[0070] By using the same process as the aforementioned fabricating process, diode cells for a rectification bridge may be formed at the same time. It will be apparent that diode cells for a rectification bridge may be separately formed through a typical semiconductor fabricating process.
[0071] Then, the conductive wires 80-1 to 80-n for electrically connecting the N-type semiconductor layers 40 and the P-type semiconductor layers 60 of the adjacent light emitting cells 100-1 to 100-n are formed through a predetermined process such as a bridge process or a step-cover process. The conductive wires 80-1 to 80-n are formed of a conductive material such as metal, silicon doped with impurities, or a silicon compound.
[0072] The bridge process is also referred to as an air bridge process, and this process will be described in brief. First, a photoresist is provided on a substrate having light emitting cells formed thereon, and a first photoresist pattern having openings for exposing the exposed portion of the N-type semiconductor layer and the electrode layer on the P-type semiconductor layer is then formed using an exposure technique. Thereafter, a metal material layer with a small thickness is formed using an e-beam evaporation technique or the like. The metal material layer is formed on entire top surfaces of the openings and photoresist pattern. Subsequently, a second photoresist pattern for exposing regions between the adjacent light emitting cells to be connected to one another as well as the metal material layer on the openings is formed again on the first photoresist pattern. Thereafter, gold is formed using a plating technique, and the first and second photoresist patterns are then removed. As a result, wires for connecting the adjacent light emitting cells to one another are left, and all the other metal material layers and photoresist patterns are removed so that the wires can connect the light emitting cells to one another in the form of bridges as shown in the figures.
[0073] Meanwhile, the step-cover process includes the step of forming an insulating layer on a substrate with light emitting cells. The insulating layer is patterned using lithographic and etching techniques to form openings for exposing the N-type semiconductor layer and the electrode layer on the P-type semiconductor layer. Subsequently, a metal layer for filling the openings and covering the insulating layer is formed using an e-beam evaporation technique or the like. Thereafter, the metal layer is patterned using lithographic and etching techniques to form wires for connecting the adjacent light emitting cells to one another. It is possible to make various modifications to such a step-cover process. Upon use of the step-cover process, the wires are supported by the insulating layer, thereby improving the reliability of the wires.
[0074] Meanwhile, the P-type pad 90 and the N-type pad 95 for electrical connection with the outside are formed on the light emitting cells 100-1 and 100-n located at both ends of the LED chip, respectively. Bonding wires (not shown) may be connected to the P-type pad 90 and N-type pad 95.
