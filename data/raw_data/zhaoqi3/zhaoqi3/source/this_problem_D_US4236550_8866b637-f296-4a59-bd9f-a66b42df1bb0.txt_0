In addition the rigid muslin bandage of DIN 61,631 is known which is made from bleached cotton or cotton and staple fibre. Such bandages have a high absorptivity, do not lead to allergies, and are generally found pleasant to wear by the patient. However, due to the fact that the bandage is rigid there is no possibility as in the case of the previously described elastic muslin bandage of flexibly applying the same to conical parts of the body and joints and therefore it inhibits movement. As a result the individual turns of the bandage will obviously slip.
The problem of the invention is to provide an elastic muslin bandage which is elastic and can be used as a fixing band, which has a high elastic behaviour, permits easy application to conical extremities and joints, is conductive to moisture and heat so that no moisture and "heat-chambers" are formed and in connection with which it is not possible for the individual layers of the bandage to slip.
According to the invention, this problem is solved by an elastic muslin bandage comprising a web with in part elastic and non-elastic threads and with non-elastic weft threads, characterised in that in the warp the web has
(a) textured polyfilic polyamide fibres of thickness Td 70/13/2 or
(b) a lighter titre differing therefrom or
