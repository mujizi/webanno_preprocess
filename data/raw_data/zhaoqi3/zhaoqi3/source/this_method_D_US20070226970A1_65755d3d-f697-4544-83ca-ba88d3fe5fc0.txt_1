[0065] To examine the quantitative effects of the embodiments of the present invention in improving the nonwoven fabric 110 strength, the samples' tear resistance was evaluated in the processing direction 5 and compared to corresponding tear strength of the control fabric. The tear test measures the force required to tear a textile specimen in which a tear is initiated prior to testing. More particularly, according to ASTM D2261-96 "Standard Test Method for Tearing Strength of Fabrics by the Tongue (Single Rip) Procedure (Constant-Rate-of-Extension Tensile Testing Machine)" a rectangular specimen (75 mm.times.200 mm) of the nonwoven fabric 110 was precut in the center of the long edge to form a two-tongued or "trouser-shaped" specimen. One tongue was clamped into the lower jaw of the machine and the other was clamped into the upper jaw. During the measurement, the distance between the jaws increases and the force applied to the fabric, due to the movement of the jaws, propagates the tear. FIGS. 15A-15B shows two specimens representing the rupture propagation in the control and "sample-110" nonwoven fabrics 110. It can be seen that the rupture propagates along the ridges 300 ("jet streaks") in the case of control fabrics (see FIG. 15A). This is because the jet-streaks create areas of minimum resistance which are generally aligned in the processing direction 5. The rupture front in the case of sample-110 (see FIG. 15B), however, did propagate in a straight line. Tear in this case tends to follow a path of minimum resistance which is not necessarily in the processing direction 5.
[0066] During the tear test, the force required to move the clamps was also recorded. FIG. 16 shows the force-strain curves obtained from conducting the tear test on five (5) replicates of the control and "sample-110" nonwoven fabrics 110. The results were normalized with the average resistance of the control fabric for a better comparison. An improvement of about 25% (and, in some cases, up to 50%) in the tear resistance of the fabric produced using embodiments of the present invention is evident. Similar tests have also been performed on "sample-100", "sample-120", and "sample-130," which were also produced using various embodiments of the present invention. These results are generally in agreement with the results of the co-occurrence experiment, and reveal that "sample-110" has the most uniform surface and the highest tear resistance. The load values increase rapidly with the strain and reach a plateau after an elongation of about 100% where they start fluctuating until the specimen nonwoven fabric 110 is completely ruptured. The initial increase in the load is the force needed to bring the fabric under tension without the rupture front moving. The tear resistance is averaged from the point where the rupture front starts moving towards the end of specimen (i.e., at about 100% elongation), until failure occurs. The average load of the control fabric is may be used to normalize the tear resistance of all the samples for better comparison. The average normalized tear resistances of the samples and their corresponding standard deviations are shown in Table 1 below.
[0067] As one skilled in the art will appreciate, it is important that hydroentangled fabrics maintain their strength against tensile load. It is important to ensure that amending the tear resistance of the fabrics does not damage their tensile properties. For this reason all the nonwoven fabric 110 samples produced using exemplary embodiments of the present invention were examined using the tensile test methods outlined in ASTM D 5035-95 entitled "Standard Test Method for Breaking Force and Elongation of Textile Fabrics (Strip Method)". This test reports the force required to tear a textile specimen in the tensile direction. In accordance with this method, a rectangular specimen (25 mm.times.150 mm) of the nonwoven fabric 110 is mounted on the upper and lower jaw of a tensile testing machine with its long dimension parallel to the direction of force application. The distance between the jaws is increased until the break of the fabric occurs, caused by the force applied to the specimen. The force required to break the textile specimen and the elongation of the specimen are reported during the measurement.
[0068] FIG. 17 shows the force-strain curves obtained from conducting the above-referenced tensile test on 5 replicates of the control and sample-110 nonwoven fabrics 110. These results are normalized with the maximum average tensile strength of the control nonwoven fabric for a better comparison. FIG. 17 reveals that there is no
substantial change in the tensile properties of the sample-110 in the processing direction 5. The normalized average tensile strengths of the sample-100, sample-120, and sample-130 are shown in Table 2 for comparison. The vales are normalized using the average maximum (at rupture) tensile strength of the control fabric for a better comparison. It is evident that none of the sample fabrics show any substantial reduction in their tensile properties.
