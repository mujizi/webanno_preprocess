Also, note that R.sub.p, unlike R.sub.c, is similar in magnitude for all the tracer isotopes. This is due in part to a selection of the energy ranges P and M. Therefore, R.sub.p can be interpreted for the presence of tracers in the borehole fluid in multiple tracer operations without accurate knowledge of either of the relative concentrations of all the tracers involved or of the radial distribution of any tracer outside the casing. It should be noted that R.sub.p is sensitive to changes in casing diameter. It must be recalled, however, that R.sub.p may only be obtained if the low Z toolcase is used in the gamma ray spectral tool. Both the titanium or steel toolcases can prevent gamma rays in the photoelectric energy region from reaching the detectors. R.sub.p, like R.sub.c, can be used to partition the sensitivity matrix for each tracer between borehole and formation components, as disclosed in equation 1.
In operation, in the preferred embodiment of the invention multiple tracers are used to determine fracture height or proppant height in a logging run. A plurality of standard spectra for each of the chosen tracers is utilized. There will be at least one standard gamma ray spectrum taken with each tracer isotope or isotopes inside the casing and at least one standard gamma ray spectrum taken with each tracer isotope or isotopes outside the casing. The unknown gamma ray spectrum is measured in the depth region of interest in the unknown borehole. The weighted least squares technique which is described in the aforementioned copending U.S. application may then be used to fit all of the gamma ray spectra of the tracers both inside and outside the cased hole or a subset of these to the unknown gamma ray spectrum. This yields a result of determining the amount of tracer both inside the borehole and outside the borehole simultaneously. Using this technique, only a single pass of the well logging instrument is required through the zone of interest in order to make the determination.
In the alternative embodiment, the photoelectric ratio R.sub.p or the Compton ratio R.sub.c as previously defined may be observed and utilized along with Equation 1 to determine the x-parameter in partitioning the sensitivity matrix between borehole and formation components for each tracer. These composite sensitivity matrix elements are then used to solve for the total concentrations of each tracer. The borehole and formation component will not be separated in this solution, however, but the answers will be more accurate for total tracer concentrations because more accurate overall "standard" spectra for each element will have been used in the least-squares fit.
It may also be desirable to obtain x via the expression defined in Equation 3. ##EQU1## That is, where u is the approximate computed concentration of tracer in a zone containing only borehole tracer and u+v is the approximate computed concentration of tracer in all other zones containing both borehole and formation tracers. These approximate concentrations are obtained using only prespecified tracers standard spectra, fitted to the observed data in an initial estimate to the concentrations. It may be possible to assist in determining the zone containing only borehole tracer by using the value of R.sub.p or R.sub.c in this zone (comparing to expected values for borehole located tracers).
Thus, in this alternative embodiment the parameter x can be determined by measuring the photoelectric ratio R.sub.p or Compton ratio R.sub.c as an approximate indicator of partitioning between the borehole and formation tracer concentrations; it might be desirable in some multitracer applications to determine x using the technique described in equation (3) above. It may also be possible to determine the partitioning parameter x using some other criterion which approximately partitions the observed spectral count rates between borehole and formation components.
