[0399]The filler fluid may be any fluid in which the droplet microactuator can, under the right conditions, conduct one or more droplet operations. It should be noted that certain filler fluids may be solids or highly viscous fluids under certain conditions, e.g., during transport, while they are transformed into fluids for operation, e.g., by heating. The filler fluid may be a liquid or gas during operation of the droplet microactuator. Examples of suitable liquid filler fluids include, without limitation, silicone oils; fluorosilicone oils; hydrocarbons, including for example, alkanes, such as decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane; aliphatic and aromatic alkanes such as dodecane, hexadecane, and cyclohexane, hydrocarbon oils, mineral oils, paraffin oils; halogenated oils, such as fluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons (e.g. 3M Fluorinert liquids); mixtures of any of the foregoing oils in the same class; mixtures of any of the foregoing oils in different classes. Examples of suitable gas filler fluids include, without limitation, air, argon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, humidified air, any inert gases. In one embodiment, the primary phase is an aqueous solution, and the secondary phase is air or an oil which is relatively immiscible with water. In another embodiment, the filler fluid includes a gas that fills the space between the plates surrounding the droplets. A preferred filler fluid is low-viscosity oil, such as silicone oil. Other suitable fluids are described in U.S. Patent Application No. 60/736,399, entitled "Filler Fluids for Droplet-Based Microfluidics" filed on Nov. 14, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The fluid may be selected to prevent any significant evaporation of the droplets.
[0400]The phases of the fluids used in the protocols of the invention may be selected to facilitate protocols of the invention without undue formation of bubbles, loss of reagent to the filler fluid, and/or adherence of reagent to the droplet microactuator surface.
[0401]In certain embodiments of the invention the filler fluid may be selected to reduce or prevent evaporation of sample, reagent, or other droplets utilized in the protocols of the invention. The filler fluid may be selected to prevent sample, reagent, or other droplets utilized in the protocols of the invention from evaporating and becoming too small for further effective manipulation. Similarly, the filler fluid can be selected to prevent evaporation of sample, reagent, or other droplets utilized in the protocols of the invention from detrimentally concentrating species within the droplets in a manner which results in an unduly adverse affect on the intended use of the droplet. Moreover, the filler fluid may be selected to reduce or prevent transport of material from sample, reagent, or other droplets utilized in the protocols of the invention across the phase boundary to maintain droplet volume and/or ensure reliable microfluidic operation and/or assay results. Miscibility between phases can sometimes result in shrinking (or swelling) of the droplet phase. To prevent or reduce this problem, one or more phases of the system may be saturated with the equilibrium concentration of another phase to reduce shrinking or swelling. Thus, for example, the filler fluid may be saturated with the equilibrium concentration of the solvent for sample, reagent, or other droplets utilized in the protocols of the invention, and/or one or more of the sample, reagent, and/or other droplets utilized in the protocols of the invention may be saturated with the equilibrium concentration of the filler fluid.
[0402]In some embodiments, a liquid filler fluid is selected to minimize contact between the droplet and droplet microactuator surfaces. That is, a film of liquid may exist between the droplet and surface which prevents material within the droplet from coming into contact with and adhering to the coated surface. This approach helps to prevent fouling of the surface and related interference with droplet transport. For example, it has been observed that high concentrations of certain proteins in water droplets readily stick to certain hydrophobic surfaces spoiling the hydrophobic nature of these surfaces; whereas, the same droplets can be moved across the same surfaces without appreciable adhesion of proteins if bathed in an oil which minimizes contact between the two surfaces. This approach may also help to avoid cross-contamination between droplets caused by deposition of material from one droplet which is then picked up by a second droplet. In a similar embodiment, a film between the droplet and droplet microactuator surface can be used to lubricate the droplet by preventing friction-like physical interactions between the droplet and surface during droplet operations.
[0403]In one embodiment, the invention provides a thin coating of a liquid filler fluid layer in an otherwise gas filled system. For example, the invention provides a microfluidic system including an open or enclosed system including a thin layer of filler fluid, such as oil, layered on a droplet microactuator surface, wherein the system is otherwise filled with a gas. The oil is of sufficient thickness to provide lubrication and contamination of droplet microactuator surfaces and contamination of droplets via droplet microactuator surfaces. Preferably the oil is selected to minimize transport of material between the droplet and oil phases. One advantage of this approach is reduction of carry-over in the droplet microactuator. The surface may in some embodiments be treated by coating it with the filler fluid while operating in air. This approach is also useful for loading operations as a means to retain the lubricating effect of oil while avoiding trapping of oil bubbles in the bulk filler fluid.
