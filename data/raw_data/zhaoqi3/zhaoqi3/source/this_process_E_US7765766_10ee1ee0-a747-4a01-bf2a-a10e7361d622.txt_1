Finally, another Spanish invention pertinent to this same state of the art, describes in Utility model U200402304 "Perfected structure of a modular tower for wind turbines and other applications" which consists of another invention by the same inventor which claims the division of the tower into sections limited by horizontal joints and the division of each section of tower into different prefabricated elements, known as segments, in portions, so that they have dimensions and weights which facilitate their transportation from the factory to the wind farm. In this technique the union of the various structural elements is achieved by means of reinforced or pre-stressed connections. All of which implies the need to resolve the union of these elements so that problems of resistance and deformation associated with such unions using different materials in a situation where they require the special characteristics of water tightness and mechanical resistance.
Nevertheless, and despite the advances made in the State of the Art, due to the previous inventions, in order to achieve the objective of creating concrete tower structures with precast parts erected at the final site, which will contribute to the known technology currently used in the State of the Art, it is necessary to devise a structure and procedure which enables it to be carried out in a viable manner with respect to mechanical resistance, therefore resulting in viable costs and execution time constraints, which is the object of the present invention.
The structure and assembly procedure for the wind turbine concrete towers which is the object of this invention and which is described below, consists of a procedure for erecting the concrete towers consisting of various stages or phases which may be developed at the same time in the different towers of a wind farm, including erection and pre-assembly activities of the sections of each tower of a wind generator in which each section of the tower structure may be composed of a different number of segments or longitudinal sections depending on the situation of that section in the height of the tower. This process comprises two differentiated sequences, one of pre-assembly for each tower section and the erection of said sections, including a pre-assembly phase for each section, a process divided into the following stages, for each section comprising different segments: a phase for the transport and erection of each segment, therefore there being as many phases as there are segments, followed by a final phase comprising filling in of the vertical joints of each section.
In addition, the aforementioned pre-assembly cycle may be carried out for the first section of the wind turbine tower directly on the final site on the base footing or foundation of the turbine whereas the other intermediate section are pre-mounted on assembly bases which are placed on the ground on the platform area provided in the proximity of the base of each wind turbine or on the base itself, placing the segments in their position with the aid of stabilising and bracing struts.
In addition, the erection cycle is begun following the first pre-assembly cycle, in the same wind turbine and this consists of placing each section on the previous one by hoisting with the aid of a crane and fitting it into the connection system of each section.
