The present invention provides for an improvement in a method for combining a high speed spin and a low speed spin wash action to complement the concentrated detergent solution concepts in a horizontal washer approach as described in patent application Ser. No. 07/815,774, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,191,669, assigned to the assignee of the present invention.
In patent application Ser. No. 07/815,774, a wash process is described wherein the wash chamber holding the fabric is rotated at a speed to effect less than a one gravity centrifugal force of the fabric so that the fabric will tumble in the wash chamber. A recirculating spray of concentrated detergent solution is directed onto the fabric for a first period of time as the fabric is tumbling in the wash chamber.
After the first period of time, the speed of the wash chamber is increased to effect more than a one gravity centrifugal force on the fabric so the fabric will be held against the basket wall. The recirculating spray of concentrated detergent solution is continued against the fabric for a second period of time. This method of spinning the fabric items at a high speed while spraying a highly concentrated detergent solution on the spinning clothes is referred to as a high performance method of washing. In this process, ideally, the amount of highly concentrated detergent solution used is only slightly in excess of the amount required to saturate the clothes at the given rotational speed.
The Applicants have found, however, that occasionally during the high speed spin portion of the wash process described above, one or more of the fabric items being washed will span the entire diameter of the wash basket. This may particularly occur during the washing of large fabric items such as shirts, sheets or towels, wherein at the initiation of high speed spin, one or more of the items are disposed in the wash basket at the center of rotation. As the rotation speed of the wash basket is increased, items within the wash basket are urged radially outward and forced against the peripheral wall of the wash basket. Fabric items disposed at the center of rotation, however, have different portions urged radially outward opposite each other such that the item may span the diameter of the wash basket. This results in poor wash performance because the fabric item spanning the diameter of the wash basket during high speed spin may block the recirculating spray of concentrated detergent solution.
The Applicants have discovered, however, that this problem, labeled "bridging" by the applicants, may be overcome by initially saturating the fabric items with wash liquid while tumbling them prior to high speed spinning. As may be understood by those skilled in the art, when fabric items are tumbled while being saturated with wash liquid, they have a tendency to reduce their volume and roll-up or ball. Rolling-up or balling may be understood to describe the phenomena of fabric items twisting upon themselves during tumbling within a wash basket when the fabric items are saturated. This reduction in volume of the fabric items, therefore, substantially reduces the likelihood that any fabric item may be disposed at the axis of rotation when high speed spin occurs and further the rolled-up condition of the saturated fabric items reduces the likelihood that any fabric items may unroll and span the diameter of the wash basket.
