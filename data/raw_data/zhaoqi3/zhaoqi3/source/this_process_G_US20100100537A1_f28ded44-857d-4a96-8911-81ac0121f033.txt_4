[0145] For a second agent that determined that the associated threshold has not yet been met and is of the first state, another agent is also selected in process 810. The agent that is selected is typically configured to use the same trending parameter for analysis as the second agent. In process 812, it is determined whether the selected agent has reached evaluation threshold. If not, in process 820, the state of the second agent is maintained in the first (inactive) state.
[0146] If so, in process 814, the state of the second agent is changed to the second state (active state). In process 816, a first candidate phrase which the selected trend analysis agent reached evaluation threshold with is detected. In process 818, the detected first candidate phrase is assigned to the second agent such that the second agent is now active with the first candidate phrase (e.g., same as the selected agent).
[0147] By repeating this process for multiple agents over multiple iterations (as illustrated in graphically in the example diagram of FIG. 5), a candidate phrase can be identified as the trended phrase based on a number of trend analysis agents assigned to analyze the candidate phase that are in the second state (e.g., having reached evaluation threshold). Additionally, candidate phrases can also be identified as a trended phrase when a percentage or number of agents is active in the second state. The trended phrases can be determined as trends.
[0148] FIG. 9 depicts a flow chart showing an example process for using weighted scores to determine whether an identified trend is weak or strong.
[0149] In process 902, each of the trend analysis agents assigns a score to the candidate phrase. The score can be assigned based on the analysis using a trending parameter (e.g., term occurrence frequency, document occurrence frequency, clicks, temporal, etc.). The scoring algorithm can be different for different trending parameters (e.g., proportional to term frequency, proportional to document frequency, proportional to the number of clicks, proportional to term frequency*document frequency, or proportional to the inverse of sqrt (t_current-t_previous). T_current typically corresponds to the current time when analysis is being performed and t_previous can correspond to when the document/story was retrieved (e.g., (t_current-tprevious)=how old a story is). Generally, the candidate phrase can be determined to qualify as a potential trended phrase when the score exceeds the associated threshold.
