[0040] A stable spherical vaterite calcium carbonate material was prepared in accordance with the present invention as follows. First, 4 liters of 2 M reagent grade sodium carbonate was added to a rotor-stator, high speed dispersion Kady.RTM. lab mill (model number L) available from Kady International, Scarborough, Me. Next, 4 liters of 2 M reagent grade calcium chloride was poured into the sodium carbonate solution. The mixture was stirred with the Kady mill at 40 Hz for five minutes. The reaction was carried out at room temperature (25.degree. C.). To the resultant vaterite slurry was added 1.4 g of sodium polyphosphate, (NaPO3).sub.n available from Aldrich Chemical Company. The slurry was placed in a 5-gal. plastic bucket. Three more batches of vaterite were prepared as described above and the slurries were all combined in the bucket. Thereafter, the combined slurry was filtered on a buchner funnel and washed with deionized water. The filter cake was dried in an oven at 100.degree. C. overnight. Physical properties of Example 1 stabilized vaterite is given in Table 1 below.
EXAMPLE 2
[0041] A stable vaterite calcium carbonate was prepared by first preparing a solution of 2 molar calcium chloride and 4 molar monoethanolamine. This solution was stored for 2 weeks before use. 6 liters of the previously prepared calcium chloride/monoethanolamine solution was added to a 5-gal reactor equipped with mechanical stirring means. The pH of this solution was 11.1. Carbon dioxide gas was added to the stirred reactor contents at a rate of 22.5 L/min. Carbonation continued until the reaction mixture reached pH 7.46, which took about 34 minutes. Carbonation and stirring was stopped for 30 minutes. Thereafter, carbonation and stirring resumed until the reaction slurry reached pH 6.87. The resultant vaterite slurry was filtered and washed with deionized water until the filtrate slurry reached a conductivity of 500 .mu.S, indicating the by-product salt had been washed from the wet cake. The vaterite wet cake was stabilized by mixing 12 g of sodium polyphosphate into the wet cake. Thereafter, the resultant stabilized vaterite was dried overnight in an oven at 100.degree. C. Physical properties of Example 2 are given in Table 1 below.
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3
[0042] The procedure of Example 2 was followed, except the solution of 2 M calcium chloride--4 M monoethanolamine was prepared, filtered to remove trace insoluble material, then used without ageing. Physical properties of Comparative Example 3 are given in Table 1 below.
