[0052] In this embodiment, an external device 270 electrically connected to the controller 250 may include an external controller 272 and an external storage device 274. The external controller 272 may comprise an IC chip to perform the function of controlling via electric signals, and the external storage device 274 may comprise a storage device capable of storing upload operational data, such as a flash memory, an optical disk, or a magnetic disk.
[0053] In this embodiment, when the external device 270 is electrically connected to the controller 250, the external controller 272 may detect at least part of upload operational data from the external storage device 274, and transmit the detected upload operational data to the controller 250. The controller 250 may transmit and store the transmitted upload operational data in the internal storage device 254. All of the upload operational data may be stored in the internal storage device 254 by repeating this process until all of the upload operational data is stored. In the case that the operational data to be replaced with the upload operational data, if this operation fails, controlling may be performed as illustrated in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5.
[0054] Afterwards, when the upload operational data is stored in the internal storage device 254, the stored upload operational data may be detected by the controller 250, and the controller 250 may control the driving source 15 or other devices 80. In the case where the external device 270 includes an external controller 272, the cost of the external device 270 increases, thus making it rather difficult to make the external device 270 commercially available in a module. However, sometimes updates cannot be easily done because of the small capacity of the IC chip of the controller provided in the washing machine. Hence, to solve this problem, this embodiment allows the external device 270 provided with a controller 272 to perform updating.
[0055] As the external device 270 provided with the external controller 272, electronic devices driven by a battery, such as a PDA, laptop, or mobile phone, may be used in various ways. However, sometimes an apparatus for adjusting a voltage when connecting to the washing machine may be additionally required because the driving voltage of the washing machine and the driving voltage of the computer may be different from each other. This problem may be easily overcome by installing a transformer in the slot 60. Further, the above electronic devices may not share a grounding section with the washing machine because they may be driven by a battery. In this case, problems occurring due to a voltage difference between the external device and the washing machine may be solved.
[0056] In the case of connecting a computer connected to a national electric power network, rather than to a battery, to the washing machine in order to perform update of the washing machine, there may occur a problem due to voltage differences between the computer and the washing machine. This also may be overcome by an additional apparatus, such as a transformer.
