[0039] It is known from the teaching of my U.S. Pat. No. 4,562,674 how to generate liquid foam to fill cavity spaces in building envelopes in order to provide a replaceable insulation. This system was developed to permit the switching of the envelope from an insulated mode to a transparent solar collecting mode and back on a diurnal cycle. This is an alternative to conventional insulation. This innovation permits the building itself to act as an active solar device and provide at the same time natural lighting within the building. Also, my U.S. Pat. No. 5,123,247 describes innovative, building integrated, solar collection and energy conversion methods that are completely compatible with the Replaceable Foam Insulation. However, neither of these previous patents discloses a technology for regulating a controlled environment within a building using low-grade energy.
[0040] The present invention provides a new building heating and cooling method that can be used in conjunction with these previous methods and provide thereby improved function and efficiency to these controlled environment buildings. As a result, a conventional building heating and cooling mechanisms can be eliminated or used only to backup the heating and cooling method provided herein. A further objective is to specify a process which is capable of being automated and controlled by a computer.
[0041] In this process of dynamic heating and cooling, the liquid foam physically delivers low-grade energy to the envelope of the building at a suitable temperature and rate. The quantity of energy and the rate of delivery are reduced due to the good insulating property of the liquid foam and due to the high heat capacitance of liquid foam, where the liquid component is largely composed of water. Furthermore, the liquid foam has the capacity, with evaporation of some of the water component, to remove a great deal of heat energy while it is within the building envelope and is exposed to solar energy. The soap liquid from which the liquid foam is generated has the advantage of good heat transfer with water-to-water type heat exchangers and may be used directly as a working fluid in related processes.
[0042] The process of using the liquid foam is a thermodynamic system involving continuous, automated acquisition of temperature data that is then analyzed to determine what action is to be taken to regulate the building environment.
[0043] As seen in FIG. 3, the heating and cooling system functions under two modes, namely a heating mode and a cooling mode. Once the mode has been selected, the temperature of the soap liquid in the storage tank or reservoir is heated or cooled to a predetermined temperature. For instance, under the heating modes, the temperature T.sub.r of the soap liquid in the reservoir could be respectively maintained at T.sub.1=70 degrees Fahrenheit (22.degree. C.). Similarly, under the cooling mode, the temperature T.sub.r of the stored soap liquid could be maintained at T.sub.4=50 degrees Fahrenheit (12.degree. C.). The temperature T.sub.2 of the liquid foam (soap liquid) within the building envelope is continuously sensed by at least one thermocouple disposed within the roof and wall cavities of the building structure. The sensed data are computed by a control system which is operatively connected to a pump mechanism effective for pumping soap liquid into the roof and wall cavities of the building structure where it is blown into bubbles forming the liquid foam. When the system is operating under the heating mode, soap liquid is automatically pumped to roof and wall cavities upon detection by the control unit that the sensed temperatures T.sub.2 become inferior to a threshold temperature T.sub.3 which could be fixed at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (17.degree. C.). Likewise, under the cooling mode, the soap liquid is automatically pumped from the storage tank to the roof and wall cavities when the control unit detects that the sensed temperatures T.sub.2 become superior to the threshold temperature T.sub.3.
