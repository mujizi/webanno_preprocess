In the examples which follow, the test results are obtained by the procedures described below. The paint employed for these procedures is a conventional water-based emulsion paint containing about 3 lbs/gal. (0.36 kilograms/liter) TiO.sub.2 pigment, about 1.6 lbs/gal. (0.19 kilograms/liter) of silicate extenders and about 1.7 lbs/gal. (0.20 kilograms/liter) of vinyl acrylic resinous binder in an aqueous emulsion. The pigment volume concentration of this paint is about 49%, the remaining 51% by volume of solids consisting essentially of binder. The TiO.sub.2 pigment used in the standard paint is a commercial TiO.sub.2 pigment produced by the vapor phase oxidation of TiCl.sub.4 and treated with Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 and SiO.sub.2 according to the procedure of Angerman U.S. Pat. No. 3,591,398. This TiO.sub.2 pigment consists essentially of 87.6% by weight of TiO.sub.2, 6.2% by weight of Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 and 6.2% by weight of SiO.sub.2, based on the weight of the treated pigment.
ACID SOLUBILITY
Acid solubility of the coated TiO.sub.2 pigments of this invention is measured by digesting a predetermined quantity of coated pigment in sulfuric acid and spectrophotometrically comparing it to a standard TiO.sub.2 sample similarly treated. The standard spectrophotometric curve is prepared as follows: a standard solution is prepared by dissolving 15 g. of ammonium sulfate and 1.0118 g. of TiO.sub.2, containing 98.83% by weight TiO.sub.2, in 20 ml. of 66.degree. Be. sulfuric acid and diluting to 800 ml. with water. Eighty milliliters of the sulfuric acid solution is then added to this solution. After allowing the resulting solution to cool to room temperature, it is diluted to one liter with water. The solution contains 0.001 g. of TiO.sub.2 per ml. and should be allowed to stand for one week before using.
Samples of 2, 4, 6 and 8 ml. of the aboveprepared standard solution are each mixed with 10 ml. of 30% hydrogen peroxide and diluted to 100 ml. with 10% sulfuric acid. After standing for one hour, the absorbance of these solutions is read using a Beckman Model DK, DU or B spectrophotometer against a reference solution, prepared by diluting 10 ml. of 30 % hydrogen peroxide to 100 ml. with 10% sulfuric acid at 400 m.mu. using 10 mm. cells. A plot of titanium peroxide concentration in mg/l. versus optical density is made for these samples.
To determine acid solubility of the coated TiO.sub.2 pigments, 0.2000 g. of coated TiO.sub.2 pigment is added with stirring to 10 ml. 66.degree. Be. sulfuric acid at 175.degree.C. The pigment is digested at 175.degree.C. for one hour. After digestion the sample is quenched by pouring into crushed ice, made from distilled water. The sample is diluted to 100 ml. with water and filtered. Ten milliliters of the filtrate is mixed with 2 ml. of 30% hydrogen peroxide and diluted to 25 ml. with 10% sulfuric acid. After one hour the absorbence of the sample is read against a reference solution, prepared by diluting 2 ml. of 30% hydrogen peroxide to 25 ml. with 10% sulfuric acid.
