[0002] Technologies for displaying a three-dimensional image can be classified into a technology requiring the use of spectacles of the image observer and a technology allowing the image observer to observe an image three-dimensionally with the naked eyes by making use of no spectacles. An image display method based on the latter technology is referred to as a naked-eye three-dimensional image display method. Representatives of the naked-eye three-dimensional image display method include a parallax barrier method and a lenticular-lens method. In the case of the parallax barrier method and the lenticular-lens method, a plurality of disparity images for a binocular vision are spatially divided and displayed by synthesizing on an image display device such as a liquid-crystal display device and, then, the disparity images are subjected to a disparity separation process in the horizontal direction by making use of a parallax device serving as disparity separation means in order to implement the binocular vision. In the case of 2 observing points for example, the disparity images are a left-eye image and a right-eye image. In the case of the parallax barrier method in particular, as a parallax device, a parallax barrier provided with a split-shaped aperture is used. In the case of the lenticular-lens method, on the other hand, as a parallax device, a lenticular lens implemented by laying out a plurality of split lenses each having a cylindrical shape in parallel to each other is used.
[0003] In the case of a three-dimensional image display apparatus making use of the image display device and the parallax device like the ones described above, the pixel structure of the image display device and the structure of the parallax device are period structures different from each other. Thus, the three-dimensional image display apparatus raises a problem of generated luminance unevenness (moire).
[0004] As a method for solving this problem, Japanese Patent No. 4023626 proposes a method of reducing the luminance unevenness by increasing the aperture width of the parallax barrier to a value greater than a normal one. In accordance with this method, however, the amount of crosstalk is inevitably increased. On the top of that, depending on conditions, the amount of luminance unevenness cannot be reduced in some cases. In addition, Japanese Patent No. 3955002 proposes a method for decreasing the amount of luminance unevenness by making the parallax barrier inclined stripes. In accordance with this method, however, depending on conditions, the luminance unevenness cannot be completely eliminated in some cases. On the top of that, Japanese Patent No. 4271155 proposes a method for decreasing the amount of luminance unevenness secondarily by orienting the parallax barrier or the lenticular lens in a direction different from the normal direction. The phrase stating "decreasing the amount of luminance unevenness secondarily" implies that the amount of luminance unevenness is decreased as a second effect of a main effect which is an improvement of the vertical-horizontal ratio of the resolution. However, this method has a problem that this method cannot be applied under a condition of few observing points including pixel positions such as a condition of observing points the number of which is smaller than 16.
[0005] It is thus desirable to provide a three-dimensional image display apparatus capable of reducing the amount of luminance unevenness generated due to a difference in period structure between an image display device and a parallax barrier in order to improve the resolution of the three-dimensional image. In addition, it is desirable to provide the image display device proper for the three-dimensional image display apparatus.
[0006] A three-dimensional image display apparatus according to the present disclosure includes an image display device. In the image display device, a plurality of pixels are laid out in the horizontal and vertical directions to form a two-dimensional matrix; each of the pixels is configured to include m sub-pixels; and a plurality of observing-point disparity images are assigned for each of the sub-pixels to form a layout pattern determined in advance and displayed by carrying out a synthesizing process. The three-dimensional image display apparatus further includes a parallax device which has a plurality of disparity separation sections associated with the sub-pixels; and which is used for separating the disparity images displayed on the image display device in a plurality of observing-point directions in order to make binocular vision of the disparity images possible.
