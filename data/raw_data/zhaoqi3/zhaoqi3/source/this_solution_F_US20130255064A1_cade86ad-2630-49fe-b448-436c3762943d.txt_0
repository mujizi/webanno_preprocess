[0051] The present inventive disclosure relates to a load-attachment connector, particularly adapted for securing connection elements used with seismic sway brace and restraint between a fluid pipe line or pipe system and a fixed structure, to anchor that system or pipeline to the structure. The general goal is to provide a secure attachment point to pipe fittings and pipe systems without any compression-type loads.
[0052] The load-attachment connector has at least three alternatives available for the connection to seismic brace or restraint elements or other useful attachments. These three attachment-point types are: (1) A flat tab of appropriate size and thickness, usually comprised of metal, projecting from the exposed end of the threaded portion of the connector, with a hole, of appropriate size, in it to connect to a number of different types of brace and restraint connections; (2) A tapped hole substantially centered in the exposed end of the threaded connector, tapped with threads compatible with a machine bolt which will thread into the connection securing some brace or restraint component; and (3) A stud substantially centered in the exposed end of the threaded connection threaded with a machine thread compatible with a nut used to secure the connection of some brace or restraint component. Larger and thicker tabs with larger holes, as well as larger tapped holes or studs, can be used to attach larger loads compatible with increased strength requirements to meet different seismic codes. The varied ways of attaching to the threaded connector allow a wide range of types of seismic braces and/or restraint attachments to be connected to a piping system.
[0053] While this solution is optimal for applications involving the seismic bracing and restraint for piping systems, the devices disclosed herein may also offer a suitable attachment point in other applications, all of which is intended to be encompassed within the scope of this disclosure, including the patent claims that follow.
[0054] The present invention is intended to provide the primary point of attachment for seismic braces and restraints to pipe systems, in areas requiring seismic design.
