As computers increase in memory and processing power, so does the ability to hold many programs and perform many tasks at once. While this is desirable to increase productivity, more programs mean more screen objects. Running them simultaneously requires increasing screen space, to have many windows open at once.
A solution to the increasing need for screen space has been to use "virtual" windows or workspaces, that is windows that extend past the area (or "viewpoint") that the screen can present. These are brought into view by manipulating the viewpoint with respect to the workspace.
The very success of this solution is also its shortcoming. Technically, it permits making the workspace of infinite surface dimension, which thus can handle a very large number of screen objects. However, as the total area becomes larger and larger, the user increasingly loses the bigger picture of what other screen objects are active, and where they are. Worse, when he needs a specific one, he might not know towards which direction of the extended workspace to search, by bringing the viewpoint there. Searching then resembles a random walk in a two-dimensional field.
To address this problem, a mapping solution is taught by U.S. Pat. No. 5,339,390. It displays the currently selected original screen space in normal size and perspective, but in a reduced portion of the screen. In the flanks it displays a condensed, reduced, and thus also distorted version of objects in the virtual space. While this preserves the bigger picture and facilitates searching, the more virtual space it covers, the more it reduces the screen portion for the original display, and the more it diminishes the size of the screen objects in the flanks.
The present invention overcomes these problems and limitations of the prior art.
