[0276] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,541,509, "The synergistic combination described herein may be useful for treating neoplasia in a subject in need of treatment. Paclitaxel and discodermolide, which comprise the synergistic combination of the present invention, may be co-administered to a subject concurrently, sequentially, or alternately, as described above. Moreover, the paclitaxel and discodermolide of the present invention may be administered to a subject by any of the methods, and in any of the formulations, described above." These comments are equally applicable to the process of the instant invention, in which discodermolide is replaced by the magnetic anti-mitotic compound of this invention
[0277] By way of yet further illustration, and referring to published U.S. patent application 2003/0235855 (the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification), claims an assay for the detection of paclitaxel resistant cells in human tumors. Claim 4 of this published patent application, which is typical, claims: "An isolated tubulin amino acid sequence comprising an amino acid sequence having at least one mutation, the mutation selected from the group consisting of a mutation at position 210, a mutation at position 214, a mutation at position 215, a mutation at position 216, a mutation at position 217, a mutation at position 225, a mutation at position 228, a mutation at position 270, a mutation at position 273, a mutation at position 292, and a mutation at position 365 and any combination thereof."
[0278] At page 1 of published U.S. patent application 2003/0235855, the importance of paclitaxel is discussed. It is disclosed that "Paclitaxel (Taxol), Taxotere and other paclitaxel-like drugs that are currently under development hold great promise for the treatment of human cancer. Paclitaxel has shown remarkable activity against breast and ovarian cancer, melanomas, non-small lung carcinoma, esophogeal cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, and some hematological malignancies. It has been described as the most significant antitumor drug developed in the last several decades and will, without doubt, find widespread use in the treatment of cancer. However, as is true of virtually all cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, patients responsive to paclitaxel eventually relapse due to the emergence of drug resistant tumor cells. Thus, there is a need in the art for methods to identify paclitaxel-resistant tumor cells, for agents that allow such identifications in a simple and cost effective way, and for methods for to treat patients with paclitaxel resistant tumor cells." The solution presented to this problem in such published patent application is also described at page 1 thereof, wherein it is stated that: "The present invention involves polynucleotide mutations which confer paclitaxel resistance; mutant cells which are paclitaxel resistant; and methods to determine paclitaxel resistance. The present invention also provides a simple assay with sufficient sensitivity to detect drug resistant cells in tumor biopsies by extracting polynucleotide from the tissue. The extracted polynucleotide is then hybridized to mutant-specific PCR primers and the mutant regions of tubulin are identified by selective amplification. Once identified, a secondary treatment protocol can be administered to the patient to aid in tumor treatment."
[0279] At pages 2 et seq. of published U.S. patent application 2003/00235855, the inventor discloses that " . . . mutations able to conver resistance to paclitaxel are clustered in several small regions of beta-tubulin." In paragraphs 0022 et seq., it is disclosed that: "The inventor has found that mutations able to confer resistance to paclitaxel are clustered in several small regions of .beta.-tubulin (Tables I-III) including I210T, T214A, L215H, L215R, L215F, L215A, L215E, L215M, L215P, K216A, L217R, L217N, L217A, L225M, L228A, L228F, L228H, F270C, L273V, Q292H, and V365D. Of these 21 identified and sequenced mutant tubulins, 15 or 62% have a substitution at leucine including locations 215, 217, 225, 228 and 273. Of the 15 total leucine mutants, 7 or 46.7% occur at leu215, 3 or 20% occur at leu217, 3 or 20% occur at leu228, 1 or 6.7% occur at leu225 and 1 or 6.7% occur at leu273. The ability of 19 of the 21 total mutations to confer paclitaxel resistance has been confirmed by transfecting mutant cDNAs into wild-type cells."
[0280] It is also disclosed in published U.S. patent application 2003/0235855 (commencing at page 3 thereof) that: "The clustering of mutations affecting leucines is unusual and unexpected. Also unexpected is the three relatively localized regions of mutation, 210-217, 225-228, and 270-273, and two isolated sites of mutations, 292 and 365. Although some of these regions appear distant in the primary structure, they are actually close together in the tertiary structure of .beta.-tubulin. The data support the hypothesis that the mutations affect a critical interaction between tubulin subunits necessary for microtubule assembly and that the mechanism of paclitaxel is to facilitate this interaction." Thereafter, in the middle of page 3 of such patent application, Table 1 is presented.
