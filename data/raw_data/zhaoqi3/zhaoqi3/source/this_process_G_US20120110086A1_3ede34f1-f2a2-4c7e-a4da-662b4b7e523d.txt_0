[0083] Additionally, the support element establishes Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) support on the AMM in order for the support element to be an SNMP trap listener to learn of other installations, e.g., of blades, etc., STEP 708.
[0084] Thereafter, through AMM commands, the support element inventories the blades that are plugged into the blade extension, STEP 710, and this information is provided to the support element, STEP 712.
[0085] In one example, prior to a blade being made available for use in a blade extension, an entitlement process is performed to determine whether there is authorization to use the blade. One example of this process is described with reference to FIG. 8. Initially, a blade is added to the chassis, which causes SNMP notifications to be sent to the support element and this notification makes the support element aware of the newly inserted blade, STEP 800. Responsive to these notifications, the support element records information about the newly inserted blade in its inventory of blades, but denotes that the blade is not yet available for use because the entitlement process authorizing its use has not yet been completed, STEP 801. Thereafter, to authorize the blade for use, an inventory of the available, but not yet authorized blades, is displayed on the console for the support element, STEP 802, and the customer selects the newly added blade that should be entitled for use, STEP 804.
[0086] Thereafter, a determination is made as to whether the blade is entitled to be made available for use, INQUIRY 806. For instance, in one particular example, a customer pays for a particular number of blades to be managed under control of the Unified Resource Manager. So, a decision is made as to whether the customer has exceeded the paid for allocation. If so, a report, such as an error report, is provided to the customer, STEP 808. Otherwise, the blade is entitled to be used. (There may be additional or different tests for entitlement.) The support element then accepts the blade as entitled, and initiates the process to configure the blade and to deploy the required Unified Resource Manager firmware on the blade, which may include the deployment and initialization of a hypervisor, STEP 810.
[0087] In one particular example, a portion of the firmware to be installed is a hypervisor on the blade. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the hypervisors to be used are shipped with the hybrid system, and stored on storage 256 (FIG. 2B) associated with the support element. Thus, the customers are relieved of the explicit responsibility for installing the hypervisors.
