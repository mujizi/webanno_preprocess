On the other hand, where the atomizing nozzles 11 are disposed in the proximity of the boundary between the compressor 1 and the inlet air compartment 10, if fine droplets can be injected or in a like case, it is easy to grasp particle diameters of liquid droplets to enter the compressor.
For example, evaporation of liquid droplets can begin with a stage nearer to the first stage side to effectively perform reduction of the driving power of the compressor.
FIG. 8 is a schematic view showing a detailed structure of a gas turbine to which the present invention is applied. Liquid droplets injected into inlet air from the atomizing nozzles 11 flow on an air flow into the compressor through the entrance. The average air flow speed of inlet air flowing in the inlet air compartment is, for example, 20 m/s. Liquid droplets 37 move on gas paths of the compressor 1 along stream lines. In the compressor, the inlet air is heated by adiabatic compression, and while the liquid droplets are evaporated from the surfaces thereof by the heat, they are transported to the rear stage blade side while decreasing the particle diameters thereof. In this process, since the latent heat of evaporation necessary for evaporation is supplied from the air (sensible heat) in the compressor, the temperature of the air in the compressor drops by a larger amount than where the present invention is not applied (refer to FIG. 4). If the particle diameters of the liquid droplets are large, the liquid droplets will collide with the blades or the casing of the compressor 1 and acquire heat from the metal so that they are evaporated, and consequently, the temperature decreasing effect of the working fluid may possibly be hindered. Therefore, from such a point of view, preferably the particle diameters of liquid droplets are small.
A distribution in particle diameter is present with injected liquid droplets. From the point of view of suppression of collision with the blades or the casing of the compressor 1 or prevention of erosion of the blades, liquid droplets to be injected are controlled so that they may have particle diameters principally of 50 .mu.m or less. From the point of view of reduction of an influence acting upon the blades, preferably the liquid droplets are controlled so that the largest particle diameter may be equal to or smaller than 50 .mu.m.
Furthermore, since liquid droplets having smaller particle diameters can be distributed more homogeneously into flowing-in air, and from the point of view of suppression of production of a temperature distribution in the compressor, the particle diameters are preferably set to 30 .mu.m or less in Sauter mean particle diameter (S.M.D.). Since liquid droplets injected from the injection nozzles have a distribution in grain size, measurement is not easy with the largest particle diameter mentioned above, and therefore, for practical use, a result of measurement with the Sauter mean particle diameter (S.M.D.) as described above can be used. It is to be noted that, although preferably the particle diameters are small, since the injection nozzles which produce liquid droplets of small particle diameters require a high precision production technique, the range of the particle diameter for practical use is defined by a technically available lower limit. Therefore, from such a point of view as just described, the lower limit to, for example, the principal particle diameter, the largest particle diameter or the average particle diameter is 1 .mu.m. Further, since the energy for production of liquid droplets in most cases increases as the particle diameter of them decreases, the lower limit may be determined otherwise taking the energy used for production of liquid droplets into consideration. Where the particle diameter of liquid droplets is set to a value around which the liquid droplets float in the atmospheric air and do not drop readily, the liquid droplets usually exhibit good heat transfer characteristics.
