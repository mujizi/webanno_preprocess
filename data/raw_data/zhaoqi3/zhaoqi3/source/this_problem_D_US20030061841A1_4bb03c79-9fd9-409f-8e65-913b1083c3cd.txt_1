[0106] The construction of the tub door 110 is described below. The tub door 110 is composed of a single door rotatable about a substantially horizontal shaft 111 extending in the lateral direction. The tub door 110 is forced into the opening direction (clockwise direction in FIG. 14) by a torsion coil spring (not shown) wound on the shaft 111. Inside the tub door 110, a tub-door-latching mechanism and an unlatching mechanism are formed. The tub-door-latching mechanism engages the edge of the front part of the tub 20 to keep the tub door 110 in the closed position. The unlatching mechanism actuates the tub-door-latching mechanism and the drum-door-latching mechanism to releases the doors from the latched positions. The main components of the tub-door-latching mechanism include an engaging cam 123 projecting from the front of the tub door 110, a clutch cam 118 for restraining the rotation of the engaging cam 123, and a projection 130 is fixed in the tub 20. The main components of the unlatching mechanism include an operation lever 112 placed on the top of the tub door 110, a rod 116, a guiding shaft 117, a traction bar 122, etc.
[0107] Explanations of the above components are as follows. The operation lever 112 as the operation mechanism is provided on the top outer door tub 110. The operation lever 112 is rotatable about a shaft 113, and is forced into clockwise direction in FIGS. 17 and 18 by a torsion coil spring 114. Behind the operation lever 112, a finger pull 115 is formed on the top of the tub door 110. The user should insert a finger or fingers into the finger pull 115 from behind, hook the operation lever 112 with a finger from below, and pull the operation lever 112 upright. When pulled upright, the operation lever 112 stands against the force of the spring 114 (FIG. 18). When the user removes the finger, the operation lever 112 immediately returns to the original position due to the force of the spring 114.
[0108] The housing of the tub door 110 is composed of an upper member 110a and a lower member 110b, each of which is a plastic molding. To produce this type of plastic member with a mold, it is necessary to form a mold gate through which molten plastic is poured into the mold. In the product obtained, a projection is formed at a position corresponding to the gate. Leaving this projection at a position that can be easily seen by the user will damage the appearance of the product. Therefore, the upper member 110a is designed so that the mold gate is located inside the finger pull 115. Thus, a projection 110c is formed on the lower wall of the finger pull 115, as shown in FIG. 19. Since this part is hidden by the operation lever 112, the projection does not mar the appearance. It is possible that the projection 110c, however, might hit the finger of the user during the operation of the operation lever 112. In view of this problem, the finger pull 115 has a slope 115a formed on the lower wall that gradually inclines from back to front, and the projection 110c is formed in front of the slope 115a, leaving a distance from the top of the slope 115a. With this construction, when the user inserts a finger into the finger pull 115 to pull the operation lever 112 upright, the back of the finger contacts the lower wall, and the fingertip goes obliquely upward along the slope 115a. Even when the finger is deeply inserted into the finger pull 115, the fingertip comes over the projection 110c without touching it. Thus, a high degree of safety is achieved.
[0109] Back to FIGS. 17 and 18 again, a rod 116 as the first moving part is provided in front of the operation lever 112. The rod 116, supported by a guide shaft 117, is directed to the inside of the tub 20 and movable back and forth. One end of the operation lever 112 is linked with the upper end of the rod 116. When the operation lever 112 is in the normal position, the rod 116 is in its highest position and does not project from the inner surface of the tub 20 (FIG. 17). When the operation lever 112 is pulled upright as shown in FIG. 18, the rod 116 is pushed down together with the rotation of the operation lever 112, and the lower end of the rod 116 projects into the tub 20. When the rod 116 fully projects while the drum 23 is in the predetermined stop position, the rod 116 contacts the supporting plate 318 of the front-side door 312 of the drum door 310 and pushes it down. This downward motion releases the claws 317 and the engagement holes 319 of the drum 23 from the engagement. In front of the guide shaft 117 is provided a clutch cam 118 rotatable about a shaft 120 formed on a clutch fixation plate 119. The clutch cam 118 is forced into the clockwise direction in FIGS. 17 and 18 by a torsion coil spring 121 wound on the shaft 120. Further, the clutch cam 118 is linked with the operation lever 112 by a traction bar 122, which corresponds to the second moving part. When the operation lever 112 is pulled upright as described above, the traction bar 122 is pulled backward, and the clutch cam 118 rotates in the counterclockwise direction against the force of the spring 121. In front of the clutch cam 118 is provided an engaging cam 123 rotatable about a shaft 124 formed on the clutch fixation plate 119. The engaging cam 123 is forced into the counterclockwise direction by a torsion coil spring 125. The engaging cam 123 has a biting part 123a at its front side and a step 123b at its rear side. The biting part 123a has upper and lower projections formed like a bill of a bird projecting from the front of the tub door 110. The step 123b is designed to engage with the clutch cam 118. A projection 130 is formed on an edge of the opening of the tub 20 opposite to the front edge of the tub door 110. The projection 130 is a part of a housing 131 to be described later, and also is a member of the tub-door-latching mechanism. The biting part 123a of the engaging cam 123 bites at the projection 130 to latch the tub door 110 in the closed position.
[0110] Next, the operation of opening and closing the tub door 110 and the drum door 310 with the lid 2 opened is described. It is assumed that at first the tub door 110 and the drum door 310 are latched in the closed positions, as shown in FIG. 17. In this state, the biting part 123a of the engaging cam 123 bites at the projection 130 on the tub 20, and the clutch cam 118 prevents the engaging cam 123 from rotation, and the traction bar 122 exerts no force on the clutch cam 118. When thus held in the closed position, the tub door 110 does not open even if an external force due to an extreme vibration or the like is exerted on it.
