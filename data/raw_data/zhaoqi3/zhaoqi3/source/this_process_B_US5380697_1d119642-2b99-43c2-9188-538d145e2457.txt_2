Suitable reaction temperatures fall within the range of about 75.degree. C. up to about 325.degree. C. At lower temperatures, the reaction proceeds so slowly as to be impractical, while at higher temperatures undesirable levels of by-products, e.g. carbon dioxide, are obtained. Preferred reaction temperatures fall within the range of about 125.degree. C. up to about 295.degree. C.; with temperatures in the range of about 175.degree. C. up to about 290.degree. C. being most preferred because selectivity to the desired epoxide falls off at temperatures significantly above about 290.degree. C. and space-time yields are undesirably low at temperatures below about 175.degree. C.
The reaction pressure can vary within wide ranges, with typical limits of about 0.1 up to about 100 atmospheres being chosen primarily as a function of safety, handling, equipment, and other practical considerations. Preferably, reaction pressure is maintained in the range of about 1 up to about 30 atmospheres.
Reaction times suitable for this process can vary within wide ranges. Generally, olefin, oxygen, organic halide and catalyst are maintained in contact for a time sufficient to obtain olefin conversions per pass in the range of about 0.1 up to about 75 mole percent. Preferred target olefin conversion levels per pass fall within the range of about 1 up to about 50 mole percent, while reaction times sufficient to obtain olefin conversion per pass in the range of about 5 up to about 30 mole percent are presently most preferred for efficient utilization of the reactor capacity.
Those of skill in the art recognize that the actual contact times required to accomplish the desired conversion levels can vary within wide ranges, depending on such factors as vessel size, olefin to oxygen ratios, the silver loading level on the catalyst, the presence or absence of any catalyst modifiers (and their loading levels), the amount of organic halide present in the reaction zone, the reaction temperature and pressure, and the like.
The process can be carried out in either batch or continuous mode. Continuous reaction is presently preferred since high reactor throughput and high purity product is obtained in this manner. The batch mode is satisfactorily employed when high volume of reactant throughput is not required, for example, for liquid phase reactions.
