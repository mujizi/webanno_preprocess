[0058] D.sub.i is the distance from the origin 112 of the first object 110 to each detector module i on the first object 110, and is a fixed and measurable quantity that is the scalar length of vectors 160, 162, 164, and 166 between the origin 112 of the first object and each of the detectors as shown in FIG. 2; and
[0059] r.sub.i is the distance between grid generator 140 and origin 122 of the coordinate frame 124 and the origin 112 of the coordinate frame 114 of the first object 110.
[0060] The method solves for the relative attitude direction cosine matrix, C.sup.R.sub.B given the grid generator 140 measurements, R.sub.i and the fixed distances, D. A minimum of three and preferably four measurement pairs {R, D}.sub.i are required for the solution. In one embodiment, the Horn Algorithm is used to solve the relative attitude direction cosine matrix; however, any other known methods may be used for this solution.
[0061] Multiple determinations over time of the direction cosine matrix may provide the basis for determining the rate of change in the attitude between the first object 110 and the second object 120. At least two direction cosine matrices must be determined to calculate a rate of change. A sampling rate for determining the position data and the corresponding direction cosine matrix will be selected based on the anticipated environment and rate of change such that the resulting attitude rate change will provide useful data.
[0062] In one embodiment the attitude rate can be determined from back differencing the relative attitude direction cosine matrix. A time series of attitude rates can be determined from the time series of relative attitude direction cosine matrices. The particular method for conducting the back differencing is not germane to the invention. Any suitable method may be used to obtain the attitude rate.
