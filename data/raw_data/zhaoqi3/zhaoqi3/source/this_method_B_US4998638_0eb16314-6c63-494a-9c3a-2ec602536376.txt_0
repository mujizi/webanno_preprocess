On the contrary, since the air in the space inside the can is heated by the contents, a relatively large negative pressure is produced as the contents cool down.
Although the synthetic resin film 4 employed in the above-described manufacturing method is a film formed to have an upwardly curved cross-section, it is possible to manufacture the can in accordance with the invention as shown in FIG. 3 and 4 by employing a synthetic resin film 7 formed to have a downwardly curved cross-section. In such a case, as shown in FIG. 3, after the end plate 2 and the synthetic resin film 7 tentatively secured together are tentatively secured to the upper end opening of the can body 1 by double seaming, the central portion of the synthetic resin film 7 is projected toward the end plate 2 as shown in FIG. 4. Since the air in the space 3 is discharged to the outside through the tentatively double seamed portion, the central portion of the synthetic resin film 7 is easily projected upwardly.
Thereafter, the tentatively double seamed portion is finally double seamed to manufacture the can shown in FIG. 1. The can manufactured by this method has the synthetic resin film 7 primarily formed to have a downwardly curved cross-section. Therefore, the film 7 is easily deformed inwardly of the can by a negative pressure. In addition, a large amount of deformation can be expected.
Accordingly, it is possible to well absorb any negative pressure inside the can.
In another embodiment of the can in accordance with the invention shown in FIG. 5, the peripheral edge of the end plate 2 of upwardly curved cross-section and that of a synthetic resin film 8 of downwardly curved cross-section are unitarily secured to the upper end brim of the can body 1 by double seaming. According to this embodiment, it has been found that the pressure in the space 9 between the end plate 2 and the film 8 is made positive by the expansion of the air in the space 9, to apply a pressing force to the inside of the can. It is to be noted that if the end plate 2 is depressed by an external force, the pressure in the space 9 is made more positive to apply a larger pressing force to the inside of the can, thereby offering a larger effect.
