By further reference to FIG. 1, it should be noted that the concentrate 12 from the second stage membrane system will contain very high concentrations of soluble inorganic compounds and moderate concentrations of sparingly soluble compounds. As discussed before, the use of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate recycle stream 10 which is blended with the first stage membrane system concentrate stream 8 will result in a lowering of the scale potential of the combined stream, thereby allowing further recovery of purified water. The concentration of TDS in stream 12 could be as high as 15%-20%, but will more likely be in the range 4%-10%. A small reject stream 13 is bled out of the second stage membrane concentrate stream in order to control the osmotic pressure. For example, if the desired overall process permeate recovery is 99%, then only 1% of the Influent stream 1 volume must be removed under flow control via reject stream 13. The balance of stream 12 flowrate is introduced into a suitable Ion Exchange Softening or Dealkalization/Carbon Dioxide Degassing device 17 in order to remove the scale forming cations such as barium, calcium, strontium, etc. By adopting softening with a strong acid cation exchange resin, hardness metals are removed at very high efficiencies of >99%. The hardness metals are replaced by sodium ions which are very soluble and offer zero scale potential. The ion exchange resin 17 thus provides a "softened" recycle stream 18, which is subsequently split in a suitable manner into two "softened" recycle streams 9 and 10 which are blended with feed streams to the first stage and second stage membrane systems respectively. These streams will therefore contain virtually no scale precursors and will thus eliminate any risk of carbonate and sulfate scaling of the membranes, as discussed earlier. The ion exchange resin is regenerated with sodium chloride at hardness breakthrough. By using an efficient IX resin and a counter-current regeneration technique, the quantity of sodium chloride used in regeneration of the resin is minimized (e.g. only 110% of stoichiometric value). Dealkalization with a weak carboxylic acid cation exchange resin is also effective in the removal of temporary hardness linked to bicarbonate and the hardness metals are replaced with hydrogen protons. The lower pH results in conversion of the bicarbonate to carbon dioxide which must be degassed by a suitable means. This process will result in partial softening which is also suitable provided a sufficiently large recycle stream 12 is used. This method has the advantage of lower acid consumption for regeneration than the strong acid cation exchange resin and will result in a reduced concentrate TDS as a result of carbonate removal.
The best mode of the present invention is discerned by reference to FIG. 2 wherein like numbers designate like functions as in FIG. 1. This embodiment also applies favorably to the economical purification of large flowrates of water where the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) concentration is low to moderate (e.g. 100 mg/L-50000 mg/L and preferably 100 mg/L-2000 mg/L) and the hardness is moderate to high in the range 100 ppm-2000 ppm. As in the first embodiment represented in FIG. 1, the Influent water 1 is pretreated to separate all suspended solids using an appropriate separation means 2 such as coagulation, flocculation, clarification, multimedia filtration, etc. followed by the first stage membrane system 7 where most of the water (i.e. 67%-95% and more likely 80%-95%) is purified in an economical manner at low pressure without scale precipitation by virtue of blending with the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate 9. The concentrate 8 from the first stage is then purified further in the second membrane stage 11 where the overall purified water recovery is increased to 95%-99.9% at high operating pressure and in the absence of scale formation since the first stage membrane concentrate is blended with a large fraction of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate stream 10, thereby reducing the overall concentration of hardness in the blended feed to the second stage 11 and enabling very high recoveries to be achieved in an economical manner. A small membrane reject stream 13 is removed from the system in order to control the concentration of soluble inorganic compounds and hence the osmotic pressure. As explained earlier, the improvement in the recovery and in the process economics over prior processes is due to deployment of a low pressure membrane stage as well as a high pressure membrane stage, recycling of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage concentrate to both the first and second stages, the use of a high efficiency Cation Exchange Softening Resin to completely remove hardness ions and the use of a very high pressure second stage membrane system (i.e. upto 3000 psig) in order to achieve very high purified water recoveries of upto 99.9% if desired, based on an Influent TDS of 200-400 ppm. In addition to these features represented by the embodiment of FIG. 1, this embodiment of the invention also provides recycling of a large fraction (i.e. 10%-100% and preferably 90%-100%) of the second stage membrane permeate 15 from the low pressure side of the second stage membrane 11 to the high pressure side of the first stage membrane 7 via stream 25 in order to provide further purification of the water using the same first stage membrane system, thus improving the quality of the combined permeate 16 while minimizing the capital and operating cost. For a given influent TDS, recycling of second stage permeate to the first stage has the same effect as introducing the permeate into a separate "second pass" membrane system with the attendant increase in capital and operating costs and space requirements.
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is represented in FIG. 3 which illustrates yet another economical high recovery application involving a two-stage double pass membrane purification of water with "low to moderate" TDS and hardness where it is desired to achieve a very high purity of the membrane permeate while minimizing the reject volume. This process could be applied to the treatment of water used in the pharmaceutical industry where high purity water must be produced in a cost-effective manner while conforming to the "zero discharge" guidelines. This embodiment is also based on the principle of using a two-stage process with "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate recycling to the first and second stage in order to achieve very high purified water recoveries at reduced cost. In order to meet the very high purity requirement of this application, the embodiment of the invention represented in FIG. 2 (viz. recycling of second stage permeate for further purification in the first stage) is deployed with the addition of a second pass semi-permeable membrane purification step 27 displayed in FIG. 3, which could be reverse osmosis membrane or "tight" nanofiltration membrane to be applied to the combined permeate 16 from the two membrane stages 7 and 11. In order to enhance the second pass membrane separation effectiveness of soluble ions at low concentration levels, the pH of the combined purified water stream 16 from the two-stage membrane system which is introduced to the second pass must be adjusted to a range very close to the neutral range, more specifically 6.5-7.5 by the addition of small quantity of base such as sodium hydroxide or acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, depending on the pH of first pass permeate stream 16. In this manner, this embodiment of the invention will provide a purified permeate stream 29 with an electrical resistivity >2 mega ohms (i.e. electrical conductivity <0.5 micro Siemen/cm) at the high overall system recoveries of 95%-99.9%. In order to minimize the reject stream volume, the second pass membrane concentrate 28 which contains relatively low TDS and very low hardness is recycled back to the high pressure side of the first stage membrane system, thereby reusing the second pass concentrate and providing only one small, high TDS, high hardness reject stream 13 in order to control the system's TDS and osmotic pressure.
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is represented in FIG. 4 which illustrates another high recovery two-stage double pass membrane purification process for the economical purification of water containing "low to moderate" TDS and hardness where it is desired to achieve an extremely high permeate quality while minimizing the reject volume. In this embodiment, the very high purity permeate 29 obtained from the second pass membrane system 27 is treated further with a mixed bed ion exchange "polishing" unit 30 in order to further reduce the electrical conductivity of the purified water 31 and increase its resistivity to >18 mega ohms, the quality required by the electronics industry in the manufacture of semiconductor wafers. By using the above-described two-stage membrane process, this embodiment of the invention therefore produces extremely high quality water without the attendant problems of scaling and loss of useful life of the membrane and without the production of a large reject waste volume which represents a disposal problem as well as a substantial operating cost. As before, a small membrane reject stream 13 is removed from the system in order to control the concentration of soluble inorganic compounds (i.e. TDS) and hence the osmotic pressure.
And yet another embodiment of this invention is represented in FIG. 5 which depicts an economical high recovery two-stage membrane process similar to the one represented in FIG. 1 except in this case the second stage membrane concentrate 12 is "softened" by using a well-mixed "Chemical Precipitation Tank" 19. The Chemical Precipitation Tank must be of a sufficiently long "residence time", in the range 5 minutes-150 minutes and preferably in the range 15-30 minutes, wherein the sparingly soluble compounds, specifically hardness compounds and silica, are precipitated out of solution. Precipitation of these compounds will be effected by raising the pH of the concentrate stream 12 to a value in the range 9-12 and preferably to 10.5-11 by using a mixture of sodium carbonate (i.e. soda ash) and sodium hydroxide (i.e. caustic soda). This will ensure efficient precipitation of the calcium associated with bicarbonate, sulfate and chloride as calcium carbonate and precipitation of magnesium as magnesium hydroxide and of silica as magnesium silicate. This reaction step will also bring about precipitation and CO-precipitation of other sparingly soluble compounds such as aluminum and ferric hydroxides, barium sulfate and carbonate, calcium fluoride, etc., thus drastically reducing the scale potential of the membrane concentrate stream 12. Other precipitation reagents such as sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide or combinations thereof may also be used for the chemical precipitation step. Once the scale-forming compounds have been precipitated, the mixture 20 containing both soluble and suspended solids is admitted into a "gravity settling tank" 21 with a conical bottom with appropriate hydraulic retention time of 5-60 minutes and more preferably 10-20 minute wherein the bulk solids are settled and discharged as a reject stream 13 containing approximately 2% w/v as Total Suspended Solids (TSS) through the bottom of the tank. Alternatively a "conventional chemically-assisted clarifier" may also be used for bulk suspended solids' separation. The clarified supernatant from the settling tank 21 will contain a relatively low concentration of suspended solids on the order of 100-200 mg/L. This stream is neutralized by reducing the pH to approximately 6-8 using an appropriate inorganic acid 22 (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, etc.), in order to "freeze" the precipitation reactions, and then filtered through an efficient filtration means 23 in order to remove all remaining suspended solids via reject stream 24 thereby providing a "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate stream 18 which is split into two streams 9 and 10 for recycle to the first stage and second stage membrane systems, respectively, as described earlier. This "softened" and "suspended solids' free" recycle stream 18 allows operation of the first stage membrane system at relatively high recoveries in the range 67%-95% and more preferably 80-95%, as well as providing very high overall process purified water recoveries in the range 95%-99.9% without the risk of fouling due to suspended solids or scaling due to hardness metals and silica. The filtration means 23 can be any suitable configuration of cross-flow microfiltration membrane, ultrafiltration membrane or nanofiltration membrane or more simply it can be a "dead end" filtration device such as a single media or multi-media filter, with or without chemical coagulation and flocculation, to be followed by a polishing filter such as a 5-10 micron cartridge filter or back-washable cloth-type filter. A small membrane reject stream 13 is removed from the system in order to control the concentration of soluble inorganic compounds and hence the osmotic pressure.
