[0031] It is preferable to construct the tub-door-latching mechanism and the drum-door-latching mechanism so that the tub door and the drum door independently move from the opened positions to the closed and latched positions. By this construction, when being closed from the opened positions, the two doors are not linked with each other, so that the user needs first to close the drum door, and then to close the tub door. If the drum door were designed to close together with the closing motion of the tub, there might arise such a trouble that, when the doors are closed, an end of the laundry hanging out of the drum opening gets caught by the drum door closed and is hidden between the drum and the tub without being noticed by the user. By the above construction, on the other hand, the user needs to close the drum door before closing the tub door. Therefore, if the laundry gets caught by the drum door closed, the user hardly fails to see it. Thus, providing adequate user-friendliness, the above construction prevents damaging the laundry or the washing machine itself due to the laundry being caught by the drum door.
[0032] The unlatching mechanism may be constructed with the following elements: a first moving part which projects into or withdraws from the inside of the drum together with the operation of the operation mechanism, and contacts the drum-door-latching mechanism to release the latch when it fully projects; and a second moving part which actuates the drum-door-latching mechanism together with the operation of the operation mechanism to release the latch. By this construction, the first and second moving parts work at different timings together with the operation of the operation mechanism. Therefore, the timings for the two latching mechanisms to release the latches can be determined as desired.
[0033] In the case where the drum-door-latching mechanism is designed to hold the drum door in the latched position when the tub door is in the latched position, there still remains a possibility that the drum door will open due to abnormal vibration or some other cause while the tub door is closed. If driven under such a condition, the drum rotates with the drum door touching the inner surface of the tub. This situation not only generates abnormal noise but also causes trouble or damage. In view of this problem, the first washing machine may preferably include a stopper which contacts the edge of the drum door when the drum attempts to rotate with the drum door opened. By this construction, when the drum door is unlatched and half-opened by the force while the tub door is closed, the stopper on the inner surface of the tub door contacts the edge of the drum door and prevents the drum from rotating. Under this condition, if the driving of the drum is forcefully continued, the motor for rotating the drum becomes abnormally loaded. Therefore, the abnormal situation can be detected by monitoring the state of the motor. Thus the drum is prevented from rotating under undesirable conditions, and abnormal noises or damage can be prevented.
[0034] The present invention further proposes a drum type washing machine wherein a drum with a substantially cylindrical peripheral wall is mounted to rotate about an axis extending in the lateral direction of a tub enclosed in a housing, which further includes:
[0035] a) a throw-in opening formed in the top of the housing, which can be closed by a lid;
