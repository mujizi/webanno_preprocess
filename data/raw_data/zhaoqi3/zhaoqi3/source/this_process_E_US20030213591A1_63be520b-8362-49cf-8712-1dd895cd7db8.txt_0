[0053] Referring to FIG. 5, thus, using the above-described pressure-pressure convolution, a process 100 may be used to estimate a particular parameter that characterizes the formation 54. In this process 100, the pressure changes (due to the start of the flow 62) at the sink and observation points are determined (block 102). Subsequently, using these pressure changes, the deconvolved G function is determined (block 104), as described above. Next, the process 100 includes identifying (block 106) a possible model to be used in the estimation of reservoir parameters from the G function. This model identification may be carried out, for example, by searching for a similar signature of the deconvolved G function from a library of available model responses. The geological as well as openhole and/or casedhole log information for the formation may be incorporated with the flow regime analysis for the model identification.
[0054] Next in the process 100, using the model obtained from block 106, the unknown reservoir parameters are estimated (block 108) using an estimation algorithm, such as, for example, a nonlinear inversion or least squares algorithm, such as the least squares algorithm that is depicted in Eq. 7. This estimation algorithm may involve an iterative process during which some of the model parameters may be dropped from the unknown parameters if the measurements are not sensitive to them. Consequently, these parameters are fixed, or constant during the estimation.
[0055] After the unknown parameter(s) are estimated, a comparison (block 110) is made between the measured and the calculated pressure changes at the observation point. This comparison may be done, for example, graphically. If a determination (diamond 112) is made that the comparison is satisfactory, then the estimation and interpretation are complete. Otherwise, the process 100 returns to block 106 to identify another model to estimate the unknown parameter(s).
