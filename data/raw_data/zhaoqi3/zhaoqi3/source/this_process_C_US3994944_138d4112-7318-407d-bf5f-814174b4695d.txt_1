can be realized only in exceptional cases. Nevertheless, methods have been developed according to which alkyl tin trichloride is formed in addition to dialkyl tin- or trialkyl tin chlorides (cf. German Pat. No. 1,161,893 or British Pat. No. 739,883).
Alkyl tin trichloride can be obtained from such mixtures, for example by distillation. However, this method is strongly limited because of the high boiling point of long chain alkyl tin trichlorides and can be technically carried out for the preparation of short chain (.ltoreq. C.sub.4) alkyl tin trichlorides only.
The simplest possibility for preparing alkyl tin trichlorides would be by the replacement of a chlorine atom from SnCl.sub.4 by an alkyl group, i.e. by a direct monoalkylation. A monoalkylation of SnCl.sub.4 has heretofore not been successfully carried out with the technically available aluminum trialkyls. However, alkyl tin trichlorides can be prepared from SnCl.sub.4 by monoalkylation with alkyl aluminum alkoxides [cf. German Offenlegungsschrift Pat. No. 2,304,617 and W. P. Neumann Ann. Chem. 653, 163 (1962)]. But in this process the great economic advantage which the aluminum trialkyls possess in alkylation reactions, in comparison with other akylating agents, is limited. Namely, ith alkyl aluminum akoxides, a maximum of only two alkyl groups can be transferred per aluminum atom.
According to German Auslegeschrift 1,157,617 and 1,164,407, it is possible, by the use of alkyl aluminum ether complexes or alkyl aluminum amine complexes, to prepare trialkyl tin compounds and dialkyl tin compounds, or mixtures of the same, according to a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric reaction. The preparation of mono-alkyl tin compounds by this method has heretofore not been possible.
In a later publication, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 653, 160 (1962), W. P. Neumann writes:
