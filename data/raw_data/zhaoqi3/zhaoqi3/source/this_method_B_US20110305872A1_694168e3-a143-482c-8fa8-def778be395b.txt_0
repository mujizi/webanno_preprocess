[0099] Zwitterion/Zwitterionic Material: unless otherwise indicated, "zwitterion" or "zwitterionic material" refers to a macromolecule, material, or moiety possessing both cationic and anionic groups. In most cases, these charged groups are balanced, resulting in a material with zero net charge.
[0100] Zwitterionic Polymers: unless otherwise indicated, "zwitterionic polymers" may be homopolymers or copolymers and include both polyampholytes (e.g., polymers with the charged groups on different monomer units) and polybetaine (polymers with the anionic and cationic groups on the same monomer unit). Exemplary zwitterionic polymers include alternating copolymers, statistical copolymers, random copolymers and block copolymers of two, three or more monomers.
[0101] Among the various aspects of the present invention may be noted the provision of articles, such as medical devices, having a non-fouling grafted polymer layer. In general, therefore, the article comprises a substrate and a polymeric material grafted from the substrate. Surprisingly, it has been found that non-fouling grafted polymer layers can be provided by incorporating one or more polymerization initiator(s) into the substrate, for example, by imbibing the substrate with the initiator(s) or depositing a layer onto the substrate that comprises the initiator(s), and grafting a polymer from the substrate. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the polymeric material is grafted from the substrate in a polymerization mixture comprising monomer and a solvent system wherein the substrate is not significantly swelled by the solvent system and the incorporated initiator has limited solubility in the solvent system. Stated differently, the initiator(s) incorporated into the substrate have reversed phase properties compared to the solvent system especially in terms of hydrophilicity. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that this method provides a relatively high local concentration of initiator(s) at or near the substrate surface/polymerization mixture interface, and favors grafting from the substrate and the grafted polymer to form a branched polymer.
[0102] Regardless of the theory, the grafted polymers of the present invention comprise a relatively dense, branched and hydrophilic structure that uniformly covers substrate surface defects and enhances performance. As a result, articles having a surface modified by the grafted polymers possess improved anti-fouling, and/or antithrombotic characteristics and, in certain embodiments, improved antimicrobial characteristics.
[0103] Generally speaking, small initiator molecules can be concentrated at or near the substrate surface, where polymerization is initiated and propagated, more readily than larger polymer molecules synthesized in solution. As a result, and as compared to graft-to coatings, greater surface densities can be achieved which, in turn, tends to improve non-fouling performance. Additionally, longer polymer chains and/or branched non-fouling chains may further improve performance.
