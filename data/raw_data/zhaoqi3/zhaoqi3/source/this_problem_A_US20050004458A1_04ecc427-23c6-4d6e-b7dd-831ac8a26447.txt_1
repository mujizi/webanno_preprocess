[0135] In the photoacoustic imaging method, the frequency spectrum of an acoustic wave ranges from 200 kHz to 2 MHz, with 1 MHz being the center frequency. The conversion elements 54 of the electroacoustic conversion unit 23 must have properties that correspond to such frequency components. The center frequency is lower than the center frequency (for example, fo: 3.5 MHz) that is applied in standard pulse echo methods.
[0136] In the first embodiment, the same conversion elements 54 acquire both the photoacoustic image data and the ultrasonic image data. Thus, the ultrasonic image obtained by the conventional pulse echo method inevitably deteriorates in spatial resolution.
[0137] It will be described how ultrasonic image data should be acquired by the harmonic imaging method in order to solve this problem. The harmonic imaging method effectively utilizes the ultrasonic nonlinear phenomenon that occurs in the tissue of the subject 7. When, for example, an ultrasonic pulse with a center frequency fo is applied to a subject 7, a second harmonic component (2fo) is generated due to the nonlinear phenomenon in the tissue to be examined. A conversion element 54 receives the harmonic component, together with a fundamental wave component. The generation of this harmonic component depends on the tissue properties of the subject 7 and also on the propagation distance to a reflecting region or ultrasonic intensity at the reflecting region.
[0138] In the acquisition of ultrasonic image data, some of the transmission ultrasonic waves applied to the subject 7 are reflected by the interface between organs of the subject 7, which differ in acoustic impedance or by a tissue. From the ultrasonic waves reflected, ultrasonic pulses are generated due to the nonlinear properties of the tissue. The ultrasonic pulses have a center frequency 2fo. Therefore, the reception ultrasonic wave that reflected by the tissue in the subject 7 reflects and the conversion element 54 receives contains both an ultrasonic pulse (fundamental wave component) having the center frequency fo at the time of transmission and an ultrasonic pulse (harmonic component) having the center frequency 2fo.
[0139] FIG. 7 shows a frequency spectrum of the ultrasonic wave assumes at this time. FIG. 7A shows the frequency spectrum of a transmission ultrasonic wave to be transmitted to the subject 7. Note that this frequency spectrum is distributed on the center frequency fo. In contrast, the frequency spectrum of the reception ultrasonic wave from the subject 7 shown in FIG. 7B is made up of a fundamental wave component and a harmonic component. The fundamental wave component is distributed, centered on fo, and the harmonic component is distributed, centered on 2fo. Generally, a harmonic component is smaller than a fundamental wave component by about 20 dB. As is known, the harmonic component is generated since the speed with which an ultrasonic pulse propagates in the subject tissue depends on the sound pressure of an ultrasonic wave, and this distorts the waveform of a reception signal.
