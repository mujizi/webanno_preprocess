[0026]The BGA structure as shown in FIG. 8A is advantageous in that the external mounting of the electronic device is rendered easy by the protruding external terminal 108 such as a solder ball. However, the distance between adjacent electrodes has to be more than the diameter of the ball. Further, the total thickness of the electronic device must be increased since the diameter of the ball is added to the thickness of the electronic device.
[0027]In producing the coreless package 120 as shown in FIGS. 10A to 10E, the transfer film 121 is removed in the final step. However, the adhesive 122 provided on the transfer film 121 may be left on the back surface of the metal electrode 105a even after separating the transfer film 121. Further, the transfer film 121 may be partially left thereon due to the imperfect separation.
[0028]In order to solve this problem, JP-A-2002-9196 discloses a method of connecting the metal base, as a core substrate, and the electrode through a metal with low adhesiveness. However, in this method, if the adhesive force between the transfer film 121 and the wiring pattern 105 is more than that between the sealing resin 110 and the wiring pattern 105, the wiring pattern 105 may be separated from the sealing resin 110 while adhering to the transfer film 121 when the transfer film (=core substrate) 121 is peeled off.
[0029]In order to solve this problem, JP-A-2002-9196 discloses a further method that the metal for the wiring pattern is thickened and an extended portion is, at the periphery, provided which extends slightly to the side of the sealing resin. However, this method causes an increase in plating time to have the increased thickness of the wiring pattern. Further, the resist film needs to be removed while keeping the shape of the apprentice (=extended portion). Because of these, it is difficult to shorten the distance between adjacent electrodes. As a result, the size of the electronic device must be increased.
[0030]Further, when the metal base is peeled off by applying a mechanical stress, the stress may cause warp or crack in the electronic device. Therefore, such a method is not suitable for the formation of, especially a low-profile electronic device.
