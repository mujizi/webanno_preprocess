[0164] Fifth Embodiment:
[0165] In the first to fourth embodiments, the optical scanning unit 13 moves the irradiation position on the subject 7, by sequentially selecting the plurality of arrayed optical fibers 71. This method requires using many optical fibers 71 in the waveguide unit 14 and using the optical scanning unit 13 for selecting the fibers 71. The apparatus must inevitably complicated.
[0166] The fifth embodiment has been designed to solve this problem in providing irradiation light. Irradiation light in the photoacoustic imaging method has almost homogeneous properties over a wide range. The spatial resolution of a photoacoustic image is determined by the convergence of acoustic waves in conversion elements 54. The fifth embodiment employs the same method of receiving acoustic waves as in the first embodiment.
[0167] The method of forming irradiation light in the fifth embodiment will be outlined, with reference to FIGS. 12A and 12B. FIG. 12A represents the positional relationship between a slit plate 78 and the conversion elements 54. FIG. 12B is a schematic diagram of the applicator 70 used in the embodiment. An electroacoustic conversion unit 23 has an optically transparent, like the one utilized in the fourth embodiment.
[0168] In the fifth embodiment, the slit plate 78 extends parallel to the array surface of the conversion elements 54 as shown in FIG. 12A. A slit is formed almost in the middle of the plate 78 and extends in the direction the conversion elements 54 are arrayed. The beam of light passing through the slit has a large width in the array direction of the conversion elements 54, and a small width in the slice direction perpendicular to this direction.
