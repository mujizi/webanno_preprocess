[0040] As shown in FIG. 2, adjacent to and overlaying surface 34 of substrate 30 is an environmental barrier coating (EBC) indicated generally as 42. Referring to FIG. 2, EBC 42 can comprise an optional inner layer 50 that is adjacent to and overlays surface 34, typically to provide a bond coat layer to improve adherence of EBC 42 to substrate 30, to provide a protective silica scale layer, to provide a seal coat, etc. This optional inner layer 50 typically has a thickness of from about 1 to about 10 mils (from about 25 to about 254 microns), more typically from about 1 to about 6 mils (from about 25 to about 152 microns). This optional inner layer 50 can comprise silicon to provide a bond coat layer, can comprise a silica scale to provide a protective and/or bond coat layer, can comprise a silicon-containing seal coat, such as a silicon carbide seal coat, etc. For example, it can be useful to preoxidize a small portion or fraction of the silicon-containing substrate 30 to form a protective silica scale inner layer 50. This preoxidized silica scale layer 50 can be formed, for example, by subjecting silicon-containing substrate 30 (e.g., a silicon-carbide substrate) to a temperature of from about 800.degree. to about 1200.degree. C. for from about 15 minutes to about 100 hours.
[0041] As further shown in FIG. 2, EBC 42 can also comprise an optional intermediate layer indicated generally as 58 that is adjacent to and overlaying inner layer 50 and underlying higher metal (e.g., rare earth) silicate-containing outer barrier layer 66 (i.e., is between inner layer 50 and outer barrier layer 66), typically for the purpose or function of providing a reaction barrier between higher metal (e.g., rare earth silicate)-containing outer barrier layer 66 and optional inner layer 50 or substrate 30 containing silicon that can potentially react with the higher metal (e.g., rare earth) silicate in outer barrier layer 66 at higher operating temperatures, so as to prevent degradation of the adherence between outer barrier layer 66 and, for example, inner layer 50. This intermediate reaction barrier layer 66 typically has a thickness of from about 0.5 to about 10 mils (from about 13 to about 254 microns), more typically from about 1 to about 6 mils (from about 25 to about 152 microns). This optional intermediate layer 58 can comprise, for example, mullite, a rare earth disilicate or a combination of mullite and rare earth disilicates thereof. For example, these combinations can comprise from about 40 to about 80% mullite, with from about 20 to about 60% rare earth disilicate. This optional intermediate layer 58 typically consists essentially of mullite which provides a very satisfactory reaction barrier between rare earth silicates in outer barrier layer 66 and the silicon/silica scale in either inner layer 50 or substrate 30. This optional intermediate layer 58 can be formed by the use of conventional coating methods such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques (e.g., electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD), ion plasma, etc.), thermal spray techniques, (e.g., plasma spray such as air plasma spray, etc.), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, etc., as described hereafter for forming thermal barrier coatings, or are well known to those skilled in the art.
[0042] As further shown in FIG. 2, EBC 42 further comprises a higher metal (e.g., rare earth) silicate-containing outer barrier layer indicated generally as 66 that is adjacent to and overlaying intermediate layer 58, typically for the purpose or function of providing protection against high temperature, aqueous environments (e.g., steam). This outer barrier layer 66 can have a thickness of at least about 0.5 mils (13 microns), and typically has a thickness of from about 1 to about 30 mils (from about 25 to about 762 microns), more typically from about 2 to about 8 mils (from about 51 to about 203 microns). This outer barrier layer 66 can be formed by the use of conventional coating methods such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques (e.g., electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD), ion plasma, etc., thermal spray techniques (e.g., plasma spray such as air plasma spray, etc.), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, etc., as described hereafter for forming thermal barrier coatings, as well as slurry-gel coating deposition techniques, diffusion surface sintering or reaction sintering/bonding techniques, etc., as described hereafter with regard to forming the corrosion resistant alumina/aluminate sealant layer. Outer barrier layer 66 can also be formed by oxide reaction bonding. In this method, the surface of the underlying layer (e.g., surface 34 of substrate 30) to be coated is first pre-oxidized to form silica at an appropriately high temperature (e.g., up to about 1350.degree. C.) for a sufficient period of time (e.g., up to about 100 hours) to form a silica scale (e.g., an inner layer 50). This silica scale layer is "dipped" or otherwise brought into contact with a higher metal oxide (e.g., rare earth metal oxide) "powder bed" and then fired or heated (e.g., to a temperature of up to about 1350.degree. C.) so to cause the silica to react with the metal oxide to form outer barrier layer 66 and bond it to surface 34 of substrate 30.
[0043] As further shown in FIG. 2, adjacent to and overlaying outer barrier layer 66 is an embodiment of the corrosion resistant alumina/aluminate sealant in the form of an outer corrosion resistant sealant layer indicated generally as 74. Outer corrosion resistant sealant layer 74 can have a thickness typically up to about 30 mils (about 762 microns), with thicker layers having a thickness more typically in the range of from about 2 to about 30 mils (from about 25 to about 762 microns). More typically, outer corrosion resistant sealant layer 74 is relatively thin. Such relatively thin outer corrosion resistant sealant layers 74 can have a thickness of up to about 3 mils (76 microns), with a thickness typically in the range of from about 0.08 to about 3 mils (from about 2 to about 76 microns). Corrosion resistant sealant layers 74 are typically formed to have relatively dense structures to protect EBC 42 and especially outer barrier layer 66 from environmental attack by corrosive agents (e.g., sulfate or chloride salts and/or oxides such as CMAS). Suitable processes for making such dense structures for corrosion resistant sealant layer 74 include chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, pack cementation techniques, etc., well known to those skilled the art, as well as physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques (e.g., electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD), ion plasma, etc., thermal spray techniques (e.g., plasma spray such as air plasma spray, etc.), etc., for depositing thermal barrier coatings, as described hereafter, and in particular slurry-gel coating deposition techniques and reaction sintering/bonding techniques, as described hereafter.
[0044] In forming relatively thin corrosion resistant sealant layers 74, e.g., up to about 3 mils (76 microns) in thickness, embodiments of the slurry-gel coating deposition process of this invention can be particularly useful. Slurry-gel coating deposition to form relatively thin corrosion resistant sealant layers 74 typically involves depositing particulates of the corrosion resistant alumina/aluminate material from a slurry or gel coating composition, followed by heating the deposited particulates to a sufficiently high temperature to fuse or sinter the particulates into a cohesive corrosion resistant sealant layer 74.
