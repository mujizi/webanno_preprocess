[0070] In one embodiment, by controlling the Av_Ird (rotor current referred to as the `d` axis), the magnetising level of the doubly fed induction generator (205) is fixed, so the reactive power flow direction in the machine is established. Furthermore, the doubly fed induction generator (205) may work as an inductive system, consuming reactive power, or may work as a capacitive system, generating reactive power. In this embodiment, the control of the Av_Ird is carried out totally independent on the control of the Av_Irq (rotor current referred to `q` axis). In another embodiment, by controlling the Av_Irq, the active power generated by the doubly fed induction generator and delivered to the grid is perfectly controlled.
[0071] Accordingly, the DFIG's stator active power loop (507) regulates the stator power (Av_Ps), by receiving a stator power set point (Sp_Pef) from the OPTC (303) and, hence, (Sp_Ps) from the General Controller (302). This loop may be based on a PI controller or a different controller with a more complex structure. The DFIG's stator active power calculation is described in further detail below. The PI controller (507) output is the rotor current set point (Sp_Irq). The Irq rotor current loop (511) regulates the Av_Irq current with this aforementioned set point. This Irq current loop may be based on a PI controller or a different controller with a more complex structure. The regulator ouput is the Urq rotor voltage set point (Sp_Urq).
[0072] Furthermore, the DFIG's stator reactive power loop (508) regulates the stator reactive power (Av_Qs), receiving a stator reactive power set point (Sp_Qs) from the General Controller (302). This Sp_Qs may be based on a fixed value, SCADA settings or the like. This reactive power loop may be based on a PI controller or a different controller with a more complex structure. The stator reactive power calculation is described in further detail below. The PI controller (508) output is the Ird rotor current set point (Sp_Ird). The Ird rotor current loop (512) regulates the Av_Ird current with this aforementioned set point. This Ird current loop may be based on a PI controller or a different controller with a more complex structure. The regulator output is the Urd rotor voltage set point (Sp_Urd). In one embodiment, this method allows magnetizing of the doubly fed induction generator from the rotor, avoiding reactive power consumption from the grid. Furthermore, controlling the doubly fed induction generator magnetising level, and measuring the grid and stator voltages the system is continuously synchronised to the grid, regarding at every moment the amplitude, the frequency and the angle of the stator voltages generated by the doubly fed induction generator (205). Connection and disconnection systems will be explained below in further detail.
[0073] In one embodiment, the AV_Irq and Av_Ird rotor currents are calculated referring the three rotor currents measurement (Ir_L1, Ir_L2, Ir_L3) (121), to a two axes rotational system with a rotational angle (.mu.-.epsilon.) where .mu. is the grid angle, calculated from the measurement of the three grid voltages (Vg_L1, Vg_L2, Vg_L3) (217), and .epsilon. is the rotor angle measured with the position and speed sensor (214).
[0074] The Av_Ps and Av_Qs are calculated using Id, Iq, Vd, Vq: Av_Ps = 3 2 .times. ( Vsd .times. Isd + Vsq .times. Isq ) Eq . .times. 1 Av_Qs = 3 2 .times. ( Vsq .times. Isq - Vsd .times. Isd ) Eq . .times. 2
