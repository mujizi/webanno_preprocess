[0131] In an embodiment, the thick-film paste may include lead-tellurium-boron-oxide in an amount of 0.5 to 15%, 0.5 to 7%, or 1 to 3% by weight based on solids.
[0132] In one embodiment, a semiconductor device is manufactured from an article comprising a junction-bearing semiconductor substrate and a silicon nitride insulating film formed on a main surface thereof. The process includes the steps of applying (for example, coating or screen-printing) onto the insulating film, in a predetermined shape and thickness and at a predetermined position, the thick-film paste composition having the ability to penetrate the insulating layer, then firing so that thick-film paste composition reacts with the insulating film and penetrates the insulating film, thereby effecting electrical contact with the silicon substrate.
[0133] One embodiment of this process is illustrated in FIG. 1.
[0134] FIG. 1(a) shows a single-crystal silicon or multi-crystalline silicon p-type substrate 10.
[0135] In FIG. 1(b), an n-type diffusion layer 20 of the reverse polarity is formed to create a p-n junction. The n-type diffusion layer 20 can be formed by thermal diffusion of phosphorus (P) using phosphorus oxychloride (POCl.sub.3) as the phosphorus source. In the absence of any particular modifications, the n-type diffusion layer 20 is formed over the entire surface of the silicon p-type substrate. The depth of the diffusion layer can be varied by controlling the diffusion temperature and time, and is generally formed in a thickness range of about 0.3 to 0.5 microns. The n-type diffusion layer may have a sheet resistivity of several tens of ohms per square up to about 120 ohms per square.
