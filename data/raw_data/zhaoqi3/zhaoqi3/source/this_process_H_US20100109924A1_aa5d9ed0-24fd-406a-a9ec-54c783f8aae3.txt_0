[0065] Through the procedure explained so far, decision of MSBs from the first sub-DAC 92A is finished and the 3-bit digital code B.sub.4'B.sub.3'B.sub.2' is obtained.
[0066] After the MSBs decision have made, a decision process for LSBs B.sub.2''B.sub.1'' is now starts by using the second sub-DAC 92B. In this procedure, the range of the decision determined in the previous process is extended by using redundancy.
[0067] The decision of the first bit B.sub.2'' with the second sub-DAC 92B is shown in FIG. 14. In this process, the whole DAC must be rearranged so that the voltage V.sub.DAC is located at the middle point of the extended rectangular region.
[0068] In doing this, there are two important points. One is that the capacitor C.sub.2 must be return to V.sub.CM from V.sub.REF as in an initial status since the capacitor C.sub.2 must be used to determine the LSB B.sub.1''.
[0069] The other is that, when the capacitor C.sub.2 returns to V.sub.CM, the reference connection for each capacitor in the first sub-DAC 92A might be changed (reference rearrange) in order to achieve the required DAC level without touching the second sub-DAC 92B. In this example, the desired DAC level for B.sub.2'' decision can be generated by connecting all the capacitors in the first sub-DAC 92A to V.sub.CM as shown in FIG. 14, as a result V.sub.DAC=V.sub.REF/2=V.sub.CM. By doing this, B.sub.2''=1 is determined. Through the same operational principle, the reference voltage of the capacitor C.sub.2 is determined to be V.sub.REF, as shown in FIG. 15, and thus all bits including B.sub.1''=0 are obtained.
