The potential for automation has been a key driving factor in the development of the interconnection process since automation is essential for large scale production of the fabric/garment. Also, automation is preferred for the reproducibility and repeatability of the various steps to create a uniform product on a continuous basis. The details of the various steps are presently discussed.
1. Softening and Removal of Insulation
In order to make a connection of intersecting electrical conductive fibers, the insulation at the intersection must first be removed. This can be done by any one of a number of ways. Suitable removable techniques include chemical etching, mechanical removal and any spot welding technique such as ultrasonic welding, laser light application or other localized heating technique. Preferably, the interconnection zone is chemically softened for the effective removal of the insulation, such as vinyl sheath. The process variables are: (i) the chemical used in the process; (ii) the concentration of the chemical; (iii) the amount of chemical applied; and (iv) duration of chemical application. Acetone has been found to work quite well as a chemical-softening agent. A few drops of Acetone are applied. It is allowed to stand for about 10 seconds before the next step in the process. These processing conditions ensure that the conductive yarn itself is not damaged. Also since polyester, cotton and SPANDEX do not interact with acetone, they are not damaged during this process. Where stainless steel is used as the electrical conductive fiber, heat alone may be sufficient to achieve the desired softening and removal of insulation.
2. Abrasion of Insulation
The next step, if needed, is to abrade the insulation at the intersection zone that has been softened. A vibrating brush can be used, preferably one that oscillates at 3000 Hz. This effectively strips out the insulation at the interconnection zone as shown in FIG. 9. The process variables are: (i) the frequency of oscillation of the brush; (ii) the pressure applied during abrasion; and (iii) duration of abrasion. By modifying these parameters, it would be possible to strip out different types of insulation without damaging the conductive yarns themselves. Depending on the method used for removal of insulation, it may or may not be necessary to carry out this step. Some methods of removal may result in removal of sufficient amount of insulation such that this abrasion step would not be needed.
