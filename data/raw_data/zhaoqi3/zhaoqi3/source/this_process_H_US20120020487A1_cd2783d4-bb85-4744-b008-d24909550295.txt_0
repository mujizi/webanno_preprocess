[0037] FIG. 5 is a flowchart that shows process flow in one embodiment of the disclosed system. For discussion purposes, this flowchart applies to system 100 of FIG. 1 and further applies to systems 200 and 300 as well. Process flow commences with start block 500 at which priority 1 audio device 105 and priority 2 audio device 110 initialize. The GUI 175 offers the user the opportunity to set a perceived audio volume threshold at the priority 1 audio device 105 that activates audio volume manager 150, as per block 505. In one embodiment, the perceived audio volume at priority 1 audio device 105 received from the priority 2 audio device 110 must reach this perceived audio volume threshold level before the audio volume manager 150 activates and commences managing the volume of the priority 2 audio device 110 Audio devices 105 and 110 exchange status information with one another via communications link 115 to let each know when the other is in use. For example, priority 1 audio device 105 sends a "priority 1 device in use" signal to priority 2 audio device 110 when the priority 1 device is in use, such as during a phone call. The priority 2 audio device 110 sends a "priority 2 device in use" signal to priority 1 audio device 105 when the priority 2 device is in use, such as while watching a movie on display 140.
[0038] In one embodiment, audio volume manager 150 in priority 1 audio device 105 operates in an inactive "monitoring mode" to monitor communication link 115, as per block 510, so that audio volume manager 150 can determine if both the priority 1 and priority 2 audio devices are simultaneously in use, as per decision block 515. If audio volume manager 150 determines that both the priority 1 and priority 2 audio devices are not currently in use, then after a predetermined time delay at block 520, audio volume manager 150 again monitors communication link 115. When audio volume manager 525 determines at decision block 515 that both the priority 1 and priority 2 audio devices are currently in use, then audio volume manager 150 changes modes from its "monitoring mode" to a "control mode", as per block 525. As discussed below in more detail, in "control mode", audio volume manager 150 adjusts the perceived volume of the priority 2 audio device at the priority 1 audio device.
[0039] As part of this process, the audio volume manager 150 determines the audio volume of the priority 2 audio device as perceived by the priority 1 audio device, as per block 530. For example, audio volume manager 150 in priority 2 audio device 110 may actively monitor the audio volume level at microphone 170 that perceives the audio signal from speaker 160 of priority 2 audio device 110. Alternatively, the audio volume manager 150 may access distance detector 180 to determine the current distance, D, between priority 1 audio device 105 and priority 2 audio device 110.
[0040] Audio volume manager 150 performs a test to determine if the currently perceived audio volume level at the priority 1 audio device 105 equals or exceed the user-set volume threshold level, as per decision block 535. If the currently perceived audio level at the priority 1 audio device 105 does not reach this threshold, then after a predetermined delay at block 540, audio volume manager 150 again determines the perceived audio volume from the priority 2 audio device as received at the priority 1 audio device. However, if the audio volume manager 150 now determines that the perceived audio volume from the priority 2 audio device as received at the priority 1 audio device does exceed the threshold volume level, then audio volume manager 150 activates and adjusts the volume that speaker 160 generates, as per block 545. More particularly, the audio volume manager 150 may instruct variable audio volume control 155 to substantially reduce volume or completely mute if the perceived audio level at the priority 1 audio device is very high. Audio volume manager 150 determines if both the priority 1 audio device and the priority 2 audio device are still in use, as per decision block 550. If both audio devices continue to be In use, then after a predetermined delay 540, audio volume manager 150 again determines the audio volume of the priority 2 audio device as perceived by the priority 1 audio device. Audio volume manager 150 again performs the audio volume threshold test of decision block 535 and another audio volume adjustment in response thereto if the threshold is still met.
[0041] In this manner, if the user of the priority 1 audio device walks away from the priority 2 audio device, the perceived volume level from the priority 2 audio device at the priority 1 decreases. In response to this decrease in the perceived audio volume level at the priority 1 audio device, the priority 2 audio device gradually increases its audio volume output until the user of the priority 1 audio device is sufficient far away that neither audio device interferes with the other. In other words, the users of the respective audio devices can operate their devices with a sufficient distance between the devices that one does not bother or interfere with the other. When decision block 550 determines that both the priority 1 audio device and the priority 2 audio device are no long both in simultaneous use, then the process ends or returns to monitoring the communication link 115 at block 510, as desired. In this manner, system 100, 200 and 300 may mitigate audio interference between the users of the priority 1 and priority 2 audio devices.
