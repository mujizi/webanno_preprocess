[0104] During this process, the microprocessor monitors the temperature of the electrode. The microprocessor is adapted to control the RF generator such that the RF energy provided by the RF generator allows the electrode temperature to approach the high target temperature without exceeding the threshold maximum temperature. If the high target temperature is not obtained by the applied energy level, the microprocessor may increase the RF energy until the high target temperature is reached. Likewise, if the electrode temperature exceeds the high target temperature but is less than the threshold maximum temperature, the microprocessor may decrease the RF energy. If the threshold maximum value is exceeded, the microprocessor shuts down the RF generator.
[0105] At steps S36, if the microprocessor determines that the measured flow rate is less than the preset flow rate value, the microprocessor calculates a rate of reduction for the flow rate. This rate of reduction is calculated by comparing the measured flow rate to the preset flow rate. In a preferred embodiment, the ratio of the two flow rates provides the comparison necessary to determine the rate of reduction. Using the rate of reduction in the flow rate, the microprocessor determines a corresponding rate of reduction in the applied energy level. The correlation between reduction in the flow rate and the energy delivery rate can be a linear relationship. Alternatively, the rate of decrease of energy delivery maybe a polynomial of the inverse of the rate of flow decrease.
[0106] During this process, the microprocessor monitors the temperature of the electrode. If the temperature of the electrode does not decrease toward the low target temperature sufficiently fast, the microprocessor may decrease the RF energy, until the low target temperature is reached. Conversely, if at anytime during a low flow rate period the electrode temperature decreases to a level less than the low target temperature, the microprocessor may increase the RF energy to maintain the electrode temperature at or near the low target temperature.
[0107] At step S37, the microprocessor determines whether the ablation time has expired. If the time has not expired, the operation process returns to step S32. If the ablation time has expired, the microprocessor sets the RF generator off at step S38.
[0108] While the various embodiments of the invention have been described as using RF energy to effect ablation, the invention is not limited to this type of energy. Various other energy sources may be used such as microwave, ultrasound, laser and cyro sources.
