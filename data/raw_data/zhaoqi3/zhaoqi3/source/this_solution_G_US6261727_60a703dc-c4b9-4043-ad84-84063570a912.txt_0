When the wavelength of the imaging radiation gets to be larger than the critical dimension, the effects of diffraction, though always present, become prominent enough to introduce noticeable distortions into the images projected relative to their original shapes on the imaging mask. These distortions are particularly sensitive to the distances between the various features in the pattern and are therefore referred to as `proximity effects`.
Another problem associated with photolithography at wavelengths close to the critical dimensions is depth of focus (DOF). In particular, when the DOF is less than the thickness of the resist being exposed, image sharpness will be lost. If light rays had no width, they would focus in a plane that was infinitely thin. In practice, because of diffraction effects, the best that can be achieved is a blur circle. As long as rays from the same point on the object are within the blur circle, they are considered to be in focus.
When resolution is not a problem, DOF can be increased by restricting the incoming light to the center of the lens. This then reduces the angle of the light cone so that focused rays travel further before leaving the blur circle. When resolution is also a consideration, this solution is no longer acceptable. One way to increase DOF without having to forego contributions from higher order diffraction maxima is to use off-axis illumination. This narrows the cone of illumination, thereby increasing DOF, while at the same time bringing more of the higher order diffraction maxima close to the center of illumination.
DOF of any particular object is, however, also affected by its proximity to other objects within the same pattern. The average degree of proximity between objects for a full pattern is conveniently expressed as a duty ratio which is defined as (total dark width)/(total clear width). Thus, DOF varies as a function of the duty ratio. The exact relationship between DOF and duty ratio is very complex but, most commonly, the higher the duty ratio (i.e. the more dark area), the greater the DOF.
Most prior art work to increase DOF has been directed towards patterns that are made up largely of lines, with the object of bringing isolated and densely packed lines simultaneously into focus (by increasing the DOF). The present invention is directed towards bringing both isolated and densely packed shapes that define contact holes into simultaneous focus. Because of the very complex nature of the optics that are involved, a solution that works for lines will not necessarily work for contact holes, and vice versa.
