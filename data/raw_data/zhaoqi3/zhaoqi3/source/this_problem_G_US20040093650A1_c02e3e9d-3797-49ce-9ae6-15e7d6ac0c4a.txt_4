[0051] As shown in FIG. 4b, the body 1 together with two axle mounted drive wheels 2 is rotatable as a unit relative to a frame 10 which is borne on its own non-driven swivel mounted wheels 11 on which there is mounted a vertical hitching frame 12 with a raisable and lowerable hook bar 8. The wheel axle of the drive wheels 2 has its midpoint on the vertical center axis of the body and in order to steer in a certain desired direction, the body 1, axle and wheels 2 need only rotate as a unit relative to the frame 10 and then move forward in that direction. The rotation is effected by driving the wheels in opposite directions. This arrangement makes it easier to calculate the steering of the autonomous mobile robot/module unit than in the embodiment discussed above.
[0052] Since the operation modules are provided with wheels, the non-driven supporting wheels of the autonomous mobile robot, when it is coupled to an operation module, will slide laterally during turning, subjecting their axle(s) to excessive bending moment if they are not freely swivelable. But if they are freely swivelable, the mobile robot, when not coupled to an operation module will not track and its steering will be ambiguous making it impossible for the robot to calculate its steering path. Therefore, the wheels 11 on the frame 10 are made to be lockable by the mobile robot in a longitudinal orientation, i.e. perpendicular to the hook bar 8, for tracking when the autonomous mobile robot is uncoupled from an operation module.
[0053] In an another embodiment, this problem is solved by a raisable and lowerable tracking wheel 11b (FIG. 4b) of a fixed longitudinal orientation, which is lowered for tracking when the autonomous mobile robot is not coupled to a wheeled operation. If provided with the raisable and lowerable tracking wheel, the other wheels 2 can remain freely pivotable.
[0054] The coupling hitch 12 is pivotally mounted about the central vertical axis a of the autonomous mobile robot, which also passes through the midpoint of the axle carrying the driving wheels 2, which are fixed in this embodiment. This method of pivotally mounting the hitch in the autonomous mobile robot increases the ease with which the autonomous mobile robot is steered when coupled to a module. The steering computer needs to be less concerned with the orientation of the autonomous mobile robot itself when calculating how to navigate with the operation module along a certain desired path. The robot thus moves freely in any direction without having to consider the orientation and placement of the robot. An automobile, for example must be moved forward or backward to change its orientation. This feature makes the mathematical calculation by the autonomous mobile robot of the path to be taken much simpler since consideration must only be taken of the orientation and position of the operation module, which is monitored by sensor means which are described in more detail below.
[0055] FIGS. 5a and 5b show two alternative designs for an articulated autonomous mobile robot where the frame 10 and the body 1 are articulated relative to each other, preferably with means for forcibly swinging the frame 10 relative to the body 1 and for locking them at a certain angle relative to each other if this should prove necessary or desirable.
