The pretreated and preconditioned Influent 6 in FIG. 1 is introduced into the high pressure side of the first stage membrane system consisting of a suitable semi-permeable membrane such as spirally wound, hollow fibre, tubular, plate and frame or disc-type nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. This first membrane stage is capable in accordance with the present invention of purifying a large fraction of the Influent water stream 1 without scale formation on the membrane surface (and attendant loss of flux and premature and costly membrane replacement). Given a relatively low Influent TDS in the range 100-1000 mg/liter (ppm), it would be possible to achieve relatively high purified water recoveries in the range 67%-95% and more preferably in the range 80%-95% (based on Influent volume 1) at relatively low first stage operating pressures in the range 100 psig-600 psig and normally in the range 200-400 psig. The high permeate recovery achievable in the first stage membrane system is made possible by recycling a small fraction of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate 9 from the second stage membrane system 11 since this recycle stream 9 will serve three main purposes: 1) it will reduce the overall hardness ion concentrations in the blended influent (stream 6) to the first stage membrane system, 2) it will increase the solubility of all sparingly soluble salts in the blended Influent stream 6 as a result of increasing the overall ionic strength of the solution and 3) it reduces the water purification load on the high pressure second stage membrane system by treating a fraction of the "softened" concentrate at lower pressure in the first stage, hence the lower overall process capital and operating costs. These three novel features allow attainment of much higher recoveries in the first stage at relatively low operating pressures, without scale formation on the membranes, thus improving the process economics significantly. Depending on the nature of the water treatment application, i.e. whether high purity is required or whether it is merely desired to remove hardness, the first stage membrane can be an RO or NF membrane, respectively. Note that while these membranes are used in prior processes, the key features of this invention are the high purified water recoveries which are achievable in an economical manner. Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, the first stage membrane system 7 provides a purified water stream 14 on the low pressure (permeate) side of the membrane, which is low in hardness and, if RO membranes are used, the purified water stream 14 will also have low concentrations of all other soluble ions such as sodium, chloride, etc. and the water can thus be used as feed to cooling towers, boilers or other high purity water applications after suitable polishing treatment with a second pass RO and/or mixed bed ion exchange polishing. The concentrate stream 8 from the first stage membrane system 7 will contain higher concentrations of soluble and sparingly soluble ions than the influent, but not high enough to cause precipitation of scale compounds at the operating recovery range of 67% to 95% (based on the Influent volume 1). It should be noted that because of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate recycle stream 9 which will likely have a volume in the range 10%-50% and more preferably 10%-20% of the Influent stream volume 1, the actual permeate recovery of the first stage membrane system will in fact be lower, in the range 60%-85% only. Since the combined stream 6 formed from blending the prefiltered Influent stream 3 and the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate recycle stream 9 will actually have lower concentration of sparingly soluble compounds and higher "soluble TDS" than the Influent stream 1, its scale formation potential is lower than the Influent 1. The scale potential can be controlled and set at a sufficiently low value by effecting good removal of hardness in the "softening" step 17 and by recycling to the first stage a sufficiently large volume 9 of softened second stage concentrate which corresponds to the "economically desirable" first stage recovery range of 80%-95% (based on the Influent volume 1). The desired purified water quality must also be achieved when determining the volume of the "softened" second stage recycle stream 9.
As shown in FIG. 1, the first stage membrane concentrate stream 8 is blended with a fraction of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate stream 10, thereby further reducing the scale potential of the combined "feed" to the second stage membrane system 11 and thus enabling further purified water recovery to be achieved. The blended stream is therefore introduced into the high pressure side of the second stage membrane system. In the system, the combined concentrate is purified by further recovery of purified permeate at operating pressures in the range 400-3000 psig, and normally in the range 400-1500 psig. The second stage membrane can be a nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis membrane (RO), spirally wound, tubular, hollow fibre, plate and frame or disc-type configuration. In this second stage membrane system, the overall process purified water recovery is increased from the 67%-95% achievable in the first stage to 95%-99.9% overall recovery, depending on the initial Influent TDS, membrane system operating pressure, required product purity and economic considerations. This translates into a relatively low second stage permeate recovery of 15%-19.9% (based on the Influent volume 1) and normally not higher than 50% based on actual second stage membrane system recovery. It should be noted that while high purified water recoveries in the range 99.1-99.9% may be desirable and indeed attainable in accordance with the present invention, when treating large Influent volumes (e.g. >2000 gallons/minute, or U.S. gpm) in order to reduce the "reject stream" disposal cost, water recoveries in the range 95%-99% are quite adequate for most applications. According to the present invention, the first stage membrane system can readily achieve a high water recovery of upto 95% at a relatively low pressure and low capital and low operating costs. The second stage membrane system which must be operated at the higher pressure in order to overcome the high osmotic pressure developed by the concentrated "soluble TDS" must therefore treat as a minimum only 4.0%-4.9% of the Influent volume 1, which is a relatively small absolute volume in most applications. For example, if the influent volume (stream 1) is 1000 gpm, the maximum purified water (i.e. permeate) flowrate to be produced by the second membrane stage 11 is merely 49 gpm. For a 2000 gpm system operating at an overall recovery of 99% with first stage recovery set at 95%, the second stage must purify merely 80 gpm of blended first stage concentrate. Such "low flow" high pressure systems will not entail excessive capital and operating costs and the overall economics of the process of this invention will therefore be very attractive when compared to prior art. As it can be seen, the present invention therefore enables attainment of such recoveries as high as 99.0%-99.9% without the attendant problems of scale formation and premature membrane failure and costly replacement that are associated with the prior art, in an economically viable manner using a relatively simple and easy to implement two-stage membrane process.
By further reference to FIG. 1, it should be noted that the concentrate 12 from the second stage membrane system will contain very high concentrations of soluble inorganic compounds and moderate concentrations of sparingly soluble compounds. As discussed before, the use of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate recycle stream 10 which is blended with the first stage membrane system concentrate stream 8 will result in a lowering of the scale potential of the combined stream, thereby allowing further recovery of purified water. The concentration of TDS in stream 12 could be as high as 15%-20%, but will more likely be in the range 4%-10%. A small reject stream 13 is bled out of the second stage membrane concentrate stream in order to control the osmotic pressure. For example, if the desired overall process permeate recovery is 99%, then only 1% of the Influent stream 1 volume must be removed under flow control via reject stream 13. The balance of stream 12 flowrate is introduced into a suitable Ion Exchange Softening or Dealkalization/Carbon Dioxide Degassing device 17 in order to remove the scale forming cations such as barium, calcium, strontium, etc. By adopting softening with a strong acid cation exchange resin, hardness metals are removed at very high efficiencies of >99%. The hardness metals are replaced by sodium ions which are very soluble and offer zero scale potential. The ion exchange resin 17 thus provides a "softened" recycle stream 18, which is subsequently split in a suitable manner into two "softened" recycle streams 9 and 10 which are blended with feed streams to the first stage and second stage membrane systems respectively. These streams will therefore contain virtually no scale precursors and will thus eliminate any risk of carbonate and sulfate scaling of the membranes, as discussed earlier. The ion exchange resin is regenerated with sodium chloride at hardness breakthrough. By using an efficient IX resin and a counter-current regeneration technique, the quantity of sodium chloride used in regeneration of the resin is minimized (e.g. only 110% of stoichiometric value). Dealkalization with a weak carboxylic acid cation exchange resin is also effective in the removal of temporary hardness linked to bicarbonate and the hardness metals are replaced with hydrogen protons. The lower pH results in conversion of the bicarbonate to carbon dioxide which must be degassed by a suitable means. This process will result in partial softening which is also suitable provided a sufficiently large recycle stream 12 is used. This method has the advantage of lower acid consumption for regeneration than the strong acid cation exchange resin and will result in a reduced concentrate TDS as a result of carbonate removal.
The best mode of the present invention is discerned by reference to FIG. 2 wherein like numbers designate like functions as in FIG. 1. This embodiment also applies favorably to the economical purification of large flowrates of water where the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) concentration is low to moderate (e.g. 100 mg/L-50000 mg/L and preferably 100 mg/L-2000 mg/L) and the hardness is moderate to high in the range 100 ppm-2000 ppm. As in the first embodiment represented in FIG. 1, the Influent water 1 is pretreated to separate all suspended solids using an appropriate separation means 2 such as coagulation, flocculation, clarification, multimedia filtration, etc. followed by the first stage membrane system 7 where most of the water (i.e. 67%-95% and more likely 80%-95%) is purified in an economical manner at low pressure without scale precipitation by virtue of blending with the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate 9. The concentrate 8 from the first stage is then purified further in the second membrane stage 11 where the overall purified water recovery is increased to 95%-99.9% at high operating pressure and in the absence of scale formation since the first stage membrane concentrate is blended with a large fraction of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate stream 10, thereby reducing the overall concentration of hardness in the blended feed to the second stage 11 and enabling very high recoveries to be achieved in an economical manner. A small membrane reject stream 13 is removed from the system in order to control the concentration of soluble inorganic compounds and hence the osmotic pressure. As explained earlier, the improvement in the recovery and in the process economics over prior processes is due to deployment of a low pressure membrane stage as well as a high pressure membrane stage, recycling of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage concentrate to both the first and second stages, the use of a high efficiency Cation Exchange Softening Resin to completely remove hardness ions and the use of a very high pressure second stage membrane system (i.e. upto 3000 psig) in order to achieve very high purified water recoveries of upto 99.9% if desired, based on an Influent TDS of 200-400 ppm. In addition to these features represented by the embodiment of FIG. 1, this embodiment of the invention also provides recycling of a large fraction (i.e. 10%-100% and preferably 90%-100%) of the second stage membrane permeate 15 from the low pressure side of the second stage membrane 11 to the high pressure side of the first stage membrane 7 via stream 25 in order to provide further purification of the water using the same first stage membrane system, thus improving the quality of the combined permeate 16 while minimizing the capital and operating cost. For a given influent TDS, recycling of second stage permeate to the first stage has the same effect as introducing the permeate into a separate "second pass" membrane system with the attendant increase in capital and operating costs and space requirements.
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is represented in FIG. 3 which illustrates yet another economical high recovery application involving a two-stage double pass membrane purification of water with "low to moderate" TDS and hardness where it is desired to achieve a very high purity of the membrane permeate while minimizing the reject volume. This process could be applied to the treatment of water used in the pharmaceutical industry where high purity water must be produced in a cost-effective manner while conforming to the "zero discharge" guidelines. This embodiment is also based on the principle of using a two-stage process with "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate recycling to the first and second stage in order to achieve very high purified water recoveries at reduced cost. In order to meet the very high purity requirement of this application, the embodiment of the invention represented in FIG. 2 (viz. recycling of second stage permeate for further purification in the first stage) is deployed with the addition of a second pass semi-permeable membrane purification step 27 displayed in FIG. 3, which could be reverse osmosis membrane or "tight" nanofiltration membrane to be applied to the combined permeate 16 from the two membrane stages 7 and 11. In order to enhance the second pass membrane separation effectiveness of soluble ions at low concentration levels, the pH of the combined purified water stream 16 from the two-stage membrane system which is introduced to the second pass must be adjusted to a range very close to the neutral range, more specifically 6.5-7.5 by the addition of small quantity of base such as sodium hydroxide or acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, depending on the pH of first pass permeate stream 16. In this manner, this embodiment of the invention will provide a purified permeate stream 29 with an electrical resistivity >2 mega ohms (i.e. electrical conductivity <0.5 micro Siemen/cm) at the high overall system recoveries of 95%-99.9%. In order to minimize the reject stream volume, the second pass membrane concentrate 28 which contains relatively low TDS and very low hardness is recycled back to the high pressure side of the first stage membrane system, thereby reusing the second pass concentrate and providing only one small, high TDS, high hardness reject stream 13 in order to control the system's TDS and osmotic pressure.
