Moreover, the method is definitely disadvantageous for mass production since the sintering has to be performed in an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen gas, and the coated substrate has to be processed within an expensive ceramic case in order to suppress the evaporation of CdCl.sub.2 within the CdS paste, and the sintering period required is often greater than 2 hours.
Furthermore, the sintered CdS layer is a thick film having an uneven thickness in the range of 20-60 .mu.m and a number of void spaces or pinholes. This layer can hardly be considered a homogeneous layer, and the adhesion strength between the CdS layer and the substrate is not adequate. In addition, a high photoelectric conversion efficiency cannot be obtained from a photoelectric conversion device or a solar cell made of a thick CdS layer because of low light transmittance.
Since the degree of pulverization of CdS powder is limited to a particle size of 2-4 .mu.m, the printing and sintering method applicable to the thinner CdS layer deposited by this method is also limited to the extent that the particles are used in the conventional method.
The chemical bath deposition method is a method in which the CdS layer is deposited on a substrate immersed in a solution containing dissolved compounds of cadmium (Cd) and sulfur (S). Although a CdS thin film having a large area can be obtained by this method, the obtained CdS film can hardly be considered to be a homogenous fill. Moreover, since the deposition does not occur only on a desired and limited area, the area unrelated to the deposition such as the back of the substrate, for example, must be excluded from the deposition in advance by applying a mask thereon before the deposition. Alternatively, the cleaning of vessels and equipment has to be carded out before each deposition process, or the solution has to be renewed. Therefore, this method had been considered to be impracticable as applied to the high speed continuous production of CdS film.
In addition to these methods, the forming of compound semiconductor fills by vacuum evaporation, sputtering, and CVD methods has been known, and by using any of these methods, the desired film property and film thickness can be obtained. However, since all of these methods have to be conducted in a vacuum chamber, these are not suitable to the high-speed continuous deposition of large area and uniform thinfilms. If the investments for enabling the deposition of thin films by any of these methods were made, the amount necessary for this large scale and complex equipment would be prohibitively high.
