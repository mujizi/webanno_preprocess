[0076] The MTBHQ radical scavenger was discovered to provided a means to control the peroxide break-time of the fracture-fluid. The MTBHQ radical scavenger provided a delay in the reduction of fracture fluid viscosity, a delay in break time. It also provided a desirable higher initial build-up in viscosity to efficiently suspend the propant during the early stages of crack expansion. Allowing proper suspension of the propant and filling/expansion of the rock-cracks. Based upon these particular conditions of temperature, fluid-type and sand considered for use, the critical viscosity required to keep the sand suspended was determined to be 100 cps. The DIBHP peroxide was an efficient breaker at a 1% weight use level. However, it was "too efficient" and the break time was to short. The use of 1% by weight DIBHP peroxide breaker resulted in the fracture-fluid viscosity is decreasing much too quickly, without proper control and could not suspend the propant effectively. The mixture did not maintain the viscosity above 100 cps for sufficient time required to pump the fluid and suspended sand down the well and into the expanding cracks. The additional of MTBHQ radical scavenger at a concentration of 6% by weight based on the peroxide was found to provide a build-up of viscosity for the fracture fluid to facilitate the suspension of propant. Viscosities peaked to 200 cps and drifted down to 100 cps over one hour, after which it continued to decline in viscosity to below 50 cps viscosity after 180 minutes. The decrease, after time to below 50 cps is desirable so as to provide a lower viscosity at the completion of the operation.
[0077] The fracture fluid consisted of a polyacrylamide based polymer water-in-oil emulsion that was dispersed at a concentration of 60 gpt (gallons per thousand) concentration into a brine solution. The brine solution consisted of 12 ppg (pound per gallon) NaCl/NaBr in water. This final 200 cps solution was then studied to compare the break-time performance of the peroxide formulations.
[0078] The first peroxide tested was DIBHP (diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide available as Luperox.RTM. DIBHP from Arkema Inc.) with an approximate assay of 50%. It was tested at 1% "as is" from the container, which is equivalent to 10 gpt (10 gallons per thousand gallons of fracture fluid). A solution of 94 wt % Luperox.RTM. DIBHP with 6 wt % MTBHQ was prepared by mixing the solid MTBHQ into the liquid Luperox.RTM. DIBHP peroxide at room temperature with stirring. 1% of this solution, which is equivalent to 10 gpt of peroxide to fracture fluid, was used. Viscosity was measured with a Grace.RTM. M5600 instrument at a 93.degree. C. reaction temperature for 180 minutes. FIG. 1 summarizes the results described above
