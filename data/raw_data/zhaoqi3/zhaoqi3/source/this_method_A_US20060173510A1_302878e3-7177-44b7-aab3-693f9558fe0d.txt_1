[0011] Accordingly, research has also been directed toward automatic responsive epilepsy treatment based on a detection of imminent seizure. Neuropace, Inc. is presently developing and conducting clinical trials on an implantable responsive neurostimulator for epilepsy. Once again, there are the risks involved with an implantable system. For episodes where the focus of the seizure moves, or where there is no clear focus, it would be nearly impossible to place electrodes in every location where a seizure focus may be. Compromises must be made to minimize the number of implanted electrodes and maximize the efficacy. Another major concern is that such a device cannot be implanted quick enough during an emergency seizure that is pharmaco-resistant.
[0012] Trigeminal nerve stimulation is also a possible method for desynchronizing seizure activity. Advanced Bionics, Inc. is currently developing an implantable device for the treatment of epilepsy that involves the application of electrical stimulation to the trigemnial nerve. As with the vagus nerve, the trigeminal nerve does not project to all areas of the brain and cannot stop all seizures. Once again, this method will have the same concerns for implantable devices as with the above-mentioned devices.
[0013] There has been only one anecdotal report in the literature about electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) use in medically intractable seizures in human patients (Griesemer et al., Neurology; 1997 49(5):1389-92): one patient experienced "change in a seizure pattern with cessation at higher intensity," while the other experienced "decrease in spontaneous seizure frequency". Surprisingly, no further studies to investigate this methodology in an animal model or in a human clinical series are found. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is performed using conventional EEG electrodes that are not capable of focusing stimulation to a specific volume of biological tissue. To perform ECT, strong muscle relaxants, as well as sedation, are often used. Thus, the patient must be monitored closely.
[0014] It has been proposed that if one can apply electrical stimulation at or near the foci, the origin of epileptiform activity, the efficacy of seizure control will be increased. Finding the seizure foci usually involves very expensive and immobile imaging equipment, such as a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) system. Even with such an elaborate system, real-time analysis of the seizure activity still cannot be achieved. Another means for seizure foci localization is to drill holes into the cranium, and insert electrodes to record and analyze the electrical activity from the brain to determine the location of the foci. The latter technique is extremely invasive, requires a neurosurgeon, and can lead to complications. Similar techniques are applicable for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders. Another problem that neither of these techniques can overcome is that the foci may move to various other locations. The fMRI and other similar imaging systems, such as positron emission tomography (PET), depend on blood flow changes, which can take many seconds to minutes to occur and thus unable to capture images of fast changing brain activity. A moving seizure focus is at best difficult to map with electrodes inserted into the brain; it may take many electrodes and many holes in the cranium to track the moving foci.
[0015] The use of electroencephalogram (EEG) is another approach to epilepsy therapy. EEG is a method for recording brain electrical activity non-invasively from the scalp surface. It can have very good temporal resolution, less than 1.0 ms per sample. EEG can also be a portable system and without being exceedingly expensive. However, EEG does have its limitations, such as the difficulty of localizing, with the type of electrodes used, the sources within the brain due to the smoothing affects of the skull and other body tissue.
