[0188] The image projector 100 of this preferred embodiment uses a projecting optical system having an extremely high angle of view (the minimum angle of view is about 60%), and so the screen 40 can be formed only of a total-reflecting Fresnel lens, and then the screen can be structured more simply at lower costs than when a refracting Fresnel lens is used in combination.
[0189] When projected light is refracted at a Fresnel lens, reflected light due to Fresnel reflection is necessarily produced. The reflected light travels an optical path differing from the intended optical path, and may become stray light to deteriorate the quality of the projected image.
[0190] For example, when there is a rear mirror in a position facing the screen, stray light coming out of the screen may be reflected at the rear mirror and reenter the screen to produce ghost. However, the image projector 100 of this preferred embodiment does not use a rear mirror and avoids this problem, since it uses a projecting optical system with an extremely high angle of view and can be sized sufficiently thin without using a rear mirror.
[0191] Not using a rear mirror enables cost reduction and weight reduction of the device and simplification of the housing structure, and also prevents deterioration of optical efficiency that would be caused by reflection loss of the mirror.
[0192] As described so far, the image projector 100 of the first preferred embodiment reduces the burden of optical designing and allows the lens structure to be configured more simply, and thus provides a high-performance image projector with simpler structure. Also, setting the minimum angle of view .theta.min larger allows the use of a total-reflecting Fresnel lens for the screen, which simplifies the structure of the screen and allows its cost reduction.
