[0117] The embodiments of the current invention address a more serious problem that occurs when the adsorbent in the product end of the bed comes into contact with humid atmospheric air. The adsorbent has a very strong affinity for water, so that once water contaminates the molecular sieve, it cannot be removed by the purge step of the process, and remains bound to the sieve, and inhibits adsorption of nitrogen. This problem has not been addressed in the prior art.
[0118] Since the adsorption system runs continuously, even a small leak over periods of weeks or months could eventually allow enough moisture into the beds to cause an unacceptable loss of capacity of the system. As described above, one solution to this problem is addressed by the embodiments of the invention in which an environment is created such that any valve leakage within the valve is removed before it can enter the product ends of the beds and damage the adsorbent. This may be accomplished by [0119] 1. sealing the valve chamber to make it air-tight, which is accomplished through the use of seal 17 and a shaft seal (not shown) that prevents pressurized feed air from leaking out along drive shaft 7, and [0120] 2. providing a small hole or vacuum vent passage to the interior of the sealed valve chamber.
[0121] In one embodiment, this is provided by vacuum vent passage 20 from arcuate vacuum slot 24 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. Alternatively, this may be provided by vacuum vent passage 20a in the wall of product housing or stator 3 as shown in FIG. 3. In another alternative, this may be provided by vacuum vent passage 20b in feed housing or stator 2 as shown in FIG. 3. When the valve is operating, any gases in the interior of the sealed valve chamber will flow toward the point of lowest pressure. In this process, that is always the suction of the vacuum pump.
[0122] By intentionally providing a flow path from the valve interior to the vacuum pump suction, any leakage of feed air from the feed rotor will be evacuated through the vacuum pump suction continuously before it can accumulate in the sealed valve chamber and contaminate the product ends of the beds as described above. Alternative passages to vacuum vent passages 20, 20a, and 20b described above may be possible and would have the same result of maintaining the desired low pressure within the sealed valve chamber.
[0123] While the above embodiment has been described for a 4-bed VSA air separation process with 8 cycle steps, the principle described may be used for VSA systems that separate any gas mixture with any number of beds and cycle steps to prevent contamination of the adsorbent by components present in the air surrounding rotary valve VSA systems. For example, a VSA system for separating a gas mixture other than air could use an adsorbent that can be contaminated by oxygen in the surrounding air; the rotary valves provided by the embodiments of the present invention can prevent this contamination.
