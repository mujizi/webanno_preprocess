In recent years, with the world's attention being directed to the environment, certain government environmental protection agencies have focused on the environmental problem posed by the uncontrolled release into the atmosphere of volatile chemicals resulting from the paint spraying of automobiles and the like. The State of California has for instance imposed strict regulations on such paint spraying for the purpose of curtailing the uncontrolled release of such volatile chemicals into the atmosphere. These regulations require a transfer efficiency of at least 65% and in air spraying systems the use of air pressure less than 10 p.s.i. With the conventional high pressure air paint spraying systems, the 10 p.s.i. air pressure requirement is insufficient to adequately atomize and deposit the paint on the surface to be painted. As a result, a different approach has been taken with respect to the air spray system which is called the high volume low pressure spray painting system. This system utilizes a turbine to supply a high volume of low pressure air to a spray gun. This system satisfies both the environmental regulations imposed by environmental protection agencies, as in California, as well as the quality of finish required for such finishes as automobiles.
At the present time, the high volume low pressure system utilizing a turbine to supply the high volume of low pressure air for such painting purposes supplies a constant volume of air to the spray gun whether the spray gun is triggered for painting or not. There are several reasons for this, the first being the necessity of maintaining a volume of air flowing through the turbine drive motor to cool the motor and second, if the air is shut off or blocked the air is heated excessively resulting in possible damage to the equipment. A problem resulting from this system of constantly blowing air at the paint spray gun is dust particles and other debris being blown onto the freshly painted finish thereby detracting from the quality thereof. Another problem which results is an increase in the temperature of the spray gun as the air passes therethrough even when actual painting has ceased.
To alleviate the problems associated with the constant supply of air to the paint spray gun even when the gun is not triggered for painting, it has been proposed to bleed the air from the system when the painting operation has been interrupted. Thus, when the spray gun trigger is released, the air supplied to the gun is by-passed, dumped or bled between the gun and the turbine. Although this solution permits the turbine motor to be cooled by the continued passage of air therethrough and prevents an increase in spray gun temperature, it still results in a high volume of air being released in the environment near to the painted finish and is therefore an unsatisfactory answer to the problem.
Of course it is not feasible to shut off or terminate the operation of the turbine when it is desired to temporarily interrupt the painting operation since start up of the system thereafter would require excessive time and would be uneconomical.
It is, therefor, an object of the present invention to provide a high volume low pressure spray painting system and a method of operation therefor wherein the high volume low pressure air supplied to the spray gun by the turbine thereof is checked during interruption of the painting operation without completely stopping the turbine fan and while still maintaining a flow of cooling air through the turbine motor.
