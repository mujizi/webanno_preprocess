In addition, the backgrounds of the screens are blocked, because flow rates become considerably slower in the backgrounds of the screens and the heavier particles in the liquid start to settle down in the background and finally block the flow area behind the screen.
Due to the positioning of the screen and the manner of blockage, it is very difficult to clean the screen and this should, thus, be avoided at all costs.
Kvaerner Pulping Technologies AB have in their patent SE-B-501243 proposed a horizontal slotted screen as a solution to the blockage problem, the screen being characterized in that the screen bars are horizontal. The screen bars are square or diamond-shaped in cross-section, i.e. sharp cornered. The critical characteristic of this solution is the fact that chip particles lie flat on top of each other like playing cards in the plug flow, and thus, when moving radially along with the lye flow, they easily wedge in the horizontal gaps of the screen or fasten to the sharp corners of the screen bars.
Another and more critical issue is slivers. There is always a large number of slivers among chips. These slivers are approximately the size of matches, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. Their diameter can be 1 to 3 mm. A part of these slivers are found sooner or later in the plug flow at the wall of the digester and the screens while the plug flow flows on. A part of the slivers are taken along by the flowing alkaline cooking liquor and they fasten to the sharp corners of the screen bars and/or to other chip particles already fastened to the gaps, thus forming a new fastening surface.
The background volume of the screens is relatively large and causes a decrease in the flow rate and thus deposits.
