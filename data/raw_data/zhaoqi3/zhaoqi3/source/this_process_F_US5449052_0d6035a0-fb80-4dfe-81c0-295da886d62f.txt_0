The invention relates to an adjusting mechanism for a disc brake, particularly a sliding-caliper disc brake.
Ordinarily, adjusting mechanisms for sliding-caliper disc brakes have at least one adjusting shaft for rotating a thrust spindle, which spindle rests against a brake head and is screwed into a thrust piece which can be subjected to force by forcefully rotating an application shaft so as to produce a compression in the direction toward a brake disc, as well as an adjusting drive mechanism between the application shaft and the adjusting shaft, which adjusting drive mechanism has a force-dependent coupling.
For installation or removal of the brake pads, or for other reasons such as repair, replacement, or the like, of individual elements, the brake is returned to its initial position. For this purpose, the thrust spindle is screwed into the thrust piece so as to move the brake head axially away from the brake disc. The thrust spindle is moved (along its longitudinal axis) away from the brake disc, as well. In this process it is possible that the thrust spindle can abut against the adjusting drive mechanism, which drive may then experience canting and jamming. When jammed, the drive mechanism cannot perform its adjusting function during the next braking process.
The underlying problem addressed by the present invention is to devise an adjusting mechanism which reliably prevents canting or jamming of the adjusting drive mechanism when the thrust spindle is screwed into the thrust piece. According to the invention, the problem is solved by providing an adjusting mechanism for a disc brake, particularly a sliding-caliper disc brake, which adjusting mechanism has at least one adjusting shaft for rotating a thrust spindle which spindle rests against a brake head and is screwed into a thrust piece which can be subjected to force by forcefully rotating an application shaft so as to produce a compression in the direction toward a brake disc, and an adjusting drive mechanism between the application shaft and the adjusting shaft, which adjusting drive mechanism has a force-dependent coupling. The force-dependent coupling is disposed on the side of the adjusting drive mechanism which is directed toward the thrust spindle. A part of the force-dependent coupling is fixed to the adjusting shaft, both rotationally and axially (axially at least so as not to be slidable in the direction away from the thrust spindle), and the remainder of the adjusting drive mechanism is axially slidable in the direction away from the thrust spindle, against an elastic restoring force.
The above-described configuration of an adjusting mechanism ensures the functioning of the adjusting mechanism even when the thrust spindle rests against the adjusting mechanism. Because of the disposition of the force-dependent coupling of the side of the adjusting drive mechanism directed toward the thrust spindle, if the thrust spindle is excessively screwed back into the thrust piece, the thrust spindle comes to abut against the said coupling, specifically against that part of the coupling which is rotationally and axially fixed to the adjusting shaft. That is, it comes to abut against that part of the coupling which rotates directly together with the thrust spindle when the screwing out of the thrust spindle occurs, and thus, in this position, it is not possible for any jamming or canting to occur. When the thrust spindle abuts against the adjusting drive mechanism, the latter can still yield axially away from the thrust spindle, against an elastic restoring means. Therefore, on the side of the adjusting drive mechanism directed away from the thrust spindle, there is no hazard of jamming or canting. Instead, a person who brings the brake back to its initial position by rotating the thrust spindle will know when said initial position is reached, because the spring force will be evident when the thrust spindle comes to abut against the force-dependent coupling of the adjusting drive mechanism. The spring force will be detected by the substantially increased force required to further rotate the thrust spindle. If the thrust spindle does happen to be rotated slightly beyond the abutting point against the adjusting drive mechanism, damage does not occur because the other parts of the adjusting drive mechanism are movable in the direction away from the thrust spindle.
