EXAMPLE 22C
1-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-2-methylazetidine-2-carboxylic acid
[0158] A solution of Example 22B (339 mg, 1.0 mmol) in a mixture of THF (5 mL) and water (3 mL) was treated with LiOH.H.sub.2O (84 mg, 2.0 mmol) in water (3 mL). Methanol was added until a transparent solution formed (1 mL). This solution was heated at 60.degree. C. overnight and the organic solvents were removed under vacuum. The residual aqueous solution was acidified with 2 N HCl to pH 2 and was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic phase was washed with water, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered and concentrated to give Example 22C (310 mg, 88% yield). MS (DCI/NH.sub.3) m/z 250 (M+H).sup.+.
