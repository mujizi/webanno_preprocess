[0049] To evaluate the degree to which air is entrained by the selected surfactants during mixing, a series of foaming tests were conducted. A Waring blender was used to mix 200 mL of water solutions containing two different concentrations of surfactants, 0.04 wt % and 0.1 wt %. To reproduce the same mixing speeds used in standard API procedures for cement slurries, the solutions were first mixed at 4000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 35 seconds and subsequently at 12,000 rpm for the same period of time. After mixing, the volumes of each of the solutions was measured in graduated cylinders as a function of time to determine the quantity of air bubbles generated during mixing and retained in the solution.
[0050] On the graph of FIG. 2, the ratio between the volume measured after mixing, V.sub.after-mixing, and the initial volume, V.sub.0, is plotted as a function of time for solutions containing 0.04% of surfactant. For each of the three surfactants tested, the ratio V.sub.after-mixing/V.sub.0 was highest right after mixing, at t=0, and then generally decreased with time. This suggests that air bubbles were present in the solutions after mixing and that an initial foam was generated, which resulted in a solution volume increase. The graphs further indicate that the ratio V.sub.after-mixing/V.sub.0 generally stabilized after an initial time period, meaning that air bubbles collapsed and the foam dissipated.
[0051] FIG. 2 suggests that, for the surfactant Tergitol.TM. MinFoam, the amount of air entrained in the solution was less problematic as the initial volume, V.sub.0, was relatively low and the solution returned to the initial volume after a few minutes. Or, the air bubbles in the solution collapsed soon after mixing and the foam generated at mixing dissipated relatively quickly. By contrast, the solution containing Triton.TM. X-102 appeared to generate more air bubbles during mixing and tended to maintain the bubbles to a larger degree than the other solution. In fact, this solution maintained a volume increase higher than 40% even after 20 minutes.
[0052] Water solutions were then provided with higher concentrations (0.1 wt %) of the same surfactants and mixed as before. At t=0, the amount of foam observed in each of the water solution having the Triton.TM. surfactants was higher than as observed at the lower concentration (0.04%). For the solution containing Tergitol.TM. MinFoam at the higher concentration, the amount of foam observed was comparable to the amount observed in the solution containing the lower concentration of the non-ionic surfactant. For each of the solutions having the higher concentration of surfactant, the rate at which the volume of solution decreased with time corresponded well with what was observed at the lower concentration. In other words, more foam was generated initially, but the foam dissipated in the same manner as observed for solutions with the lower concentration of surfactant.
