[0144] At block 455, the time domain length corresponding to the air layer height L1 measured at block 450 is converted to a space domain length (height) L1 by the convert module 226 based on the known dielectric constant of the air layer as set at the set module 284 or as measured at the measure module 286. Because it has been assumed for purposes of the present description that the top layer is air having dielectric constant .di-elect cons.1=1.0, it so happens in the present case that no conversion using the dielectric constant module 220 need be carried out, and the known layer module 282 can simply use the time domain length of the air layer to obtain the (space domain) height L1 of the air layer by simple comparison or ratiometric calibration relative to the known probe length L corresponding to the distance between the probe top and the probe bottom on that trace (see FIG. 4).
[0145] At block 460, the unknown layer module 288 derives the height L2 of the liquid layer by subtracting the space domain height L1 of the air layer as determined at block 455 from the known length L of the TDR probe 110.
[0146] Inasmuch as the foregoing method did not employ TDR to directly measure the height L2 of the liquid layer but instead derived the height L2 of the liquid layer from the known probe length L and the measured height L1 of the air layer, this method can be said to be insensitive to the dielectric constant .di-elect cons.2 of the liquid layer.
[0147] If the profile of the tank is known, this will make it possible to determine liquid layer volume from the height L2 of the liquid layer.
[0148] Since the height L2 of the liquid layer is now known, this information can be used to indirectly determine dielectric constant. That is, dielectric constant of a layer can be directly determined from an impedance-versus-time trace using the impedance-based module 222 or the time-based module 224 as described above, or can be indirectly determined if the height of the layer is known by using the same relationship as described above in connection with the time-based module 224, except that the relationship would be rearranged as
