[0050] Various embodiments described herein may have at least one ultrahard material included therein. Such ultrahard materials may include a conventional polycrystalline diamond table (a table of interconnected diamond particles having interstitial spaces therebetween in which a metal component (such as a metal catalyst) may reside), a thermally stable diamond layer (i.e., having a thermal stability greater than that of conventional polycrystalline diamond, 750.degree. C.) formed, for example, by removing substantially all metal from the interstitial spaces between interconnected diamond particles or from a diamond/silicon carbide composite, or other ultrahard material such as a cubic boron nitride. Further, in particular embodiments, an inner rotatable cutting element may be formed entirely of ultrahard material(s), but the element may include a plurality of diamond grades used, for example, to form a gradient structure (with a smooth or non-smooth transition between the grades). In a particular embodiment, a first diamond grade having smaller particle sizes and/or a higher diamond density may be used to form the upper portion of the inner rotatable cutting element (that forms the cutting edge when installed on a bit or other tool), while a second diamond grade having larger particle sizes and/or a higher metal content may be used to form the lower, non-cutting portion of the cutting element. Further, it is also within the scope of the present disclosure that more than two diamond grades may be used.
[0051] As known in the art, thermally stable diamond may be formed in various manners. A typical polycrystalline diamond layer includes individual diamond "crystals" that are interconnected. The individual diamond crystals thus form a lattice structure. A metal catalyst, such as cobalt, may be used to promote recrystallization of the diamond particles and formation of the lattice structure. Thus, cobalt particles are typically found within the interstitial spaces in the diamond lattice structure. Cobalt has a significantly different coefficient of thermal expansion as compared to diamond. Therefore, upon heating of a diamond table, the cobalt and the diamond lattice will expand at different rates, causing cracks to form in the lattice structure and resulting in deterioration of the diamond table.
[0052] To obviate this problem, strong acids may be used to "leach" the cobalt from a polycrystalline diamond lattice structure (either a thin volume or entire tablet) to at least reduce the damage experienced from heating diamond-cobalt composite at different rates upon heating. Examples of "leaching" processes can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,288,248 and 4,104,344. Briefly, a strong acid, typically hydrofluoric acid or combinations of several strong acids may be used to treat the diamond table, removing at least a portion of the co-catalyst from the PDC composite. Suitable acids include nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or perchloric acid, or combinations of these acids. In addition, caustics, such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, have been used to the carbide industry to digest metallic elements from carbide composites. In addition, other acidic and basic leaching agents may be used as desired. Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the molarity of the leaching agent may be adjusted depending on the time desired to leach, concerns about hazards, etc.
[0053] By leaching out the cobalt, thermally stable polycrystalline (TSP) diamond may be formed. In certain embodiments, only a select portion of a diamond composite is leached, in order to gain thermal stability without losing impact resistance. As used herein, the term TSP includes both of the above (i.e., partially and completely leached) compounds. Interstitial volumes remaining after leaching may be reduced by either furthering consolidation or by filling the volume with a secondary material, such by processes known in the art and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,127,923, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0054] Alternatively, TSP may be formed by forming the diamond layer in a press using a binder other than cobalt, one such as silicon, which has a coefficient of thermal expansion more similar to that of diamond than cobalt has. During the manufacturing process, a large portion, 80 to 100 volume percent, of the silicon reacts with the diamond lattice to form silicon carbide which also has a thermal expansion similar to diamond. Upon heating, any remaining silicon, silicon carbide, and the diamond lattice will expand at more similar rates as compared to rates of expansion for cobalt and diamond, resulting in a more thermally stable layer. PDC cutters having a TSP cutting layer have relatively low wear rates, even as cutter temperatures reach 1200.degree. C. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that a thermally stable diamond layer may be formed by other methods known in the art, including, for example, by altering processing conditions in the formation of the diamond layer.
