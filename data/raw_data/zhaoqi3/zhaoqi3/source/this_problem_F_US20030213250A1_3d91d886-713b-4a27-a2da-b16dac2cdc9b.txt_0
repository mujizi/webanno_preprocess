[0037] As can be seen from FIG. 3, each of the forward heat shield panels 18 and 22 includes a plurality of inner rails or ribs 50 that extend axially from the forward peripheral wall segment 44 to the aft peripheral wall segment 48. There are two attachment posts 52 typically aligned with each rail 50 and two additional attachment posts 54 positioned next to each side peripheral wall segment 46. The rails 50 are the same radial height as the peripheral walls segments 44, 46, and 48. The rails 50 define a plurality of circumferentially aligned, isolated cooling chambers 56 with the peripheral wall segments 44, 46, and 48. The rails 50 also provide structural support for the forward heat shield panels 18 and 22.
[0038] The creation of separate cooling chambers 56 is advantageous in that the cooling chambers 56 provide an even distribution of cooling air throughout the panels 18 and 22 by maintaining an optimum pressure drop through each panel section created by the axial inner rails 50 and the peripheral wall segments 44, 46, and 48. This pressure drop drives cooling air into every cooling film hole 32 in the respective heat shield panel 18 and 22 in each section in such a way that the respective heat shield panel 18 and 22 is optimally cooled by convection through the film holes 32 and by an even film flow.
[0039] If a heat shield panel were to have a region with a large open area compared to the rest of the panel, a breach, e.g. a burn-through, can cause coolant to preferentially flow through this large area as it offers less resistance to the flow. In such a case, the film holes away from this area will be starved of coolant and the cross-flow of air in the cavity that travels toward the large open area will decrease the effect of the impingement jets that it encounters in its trajectory. The combination of these two phenomena will cause an increase in metal temperature in the panel. These problems are avoided by the forward heat shield panels 18 and 22 of the present invention and the creation of the isolated cooling chambers 56. If a major breach occurs in one of the heat shield panels 18 and 22, the increase in metal temperature will be limited to the cooling chamber 56 where the breach is located, leaving the other cooling chambers 56 operating at the design temperature and the entire heat shield panel safety in place. As one can see from the foregoing discussion, if a forward heat shield panel is not equipped with separate or isolated cooling chambers 56 as in the present invention, any temperature increase will occur in a larger area of the heat shield panel causing the burn-through to expand to the entire heat shield panel. Under these circumstances, the release of a panel or a section of it, when attachment posts are lost, is unavoidable. There is a high risk of engine fire once a blade or vane in the turbine module is damaged due to rupture or burning. The forward heat shield panels 18 and 22 with their separate cooling chambers 56 avoid this problem.
[0040] Referring now to FIG. 5, there are two particularly relevant regions in each forward heat shield panel 18 and 22--the region 82 forward of the dilution holes 34 and the region 84 near the dilution holes 34. The cooling holes 32 in the forward region 82, as shown in FIG. 2A, have an orientation consistent with the local swirl direction of the combustion gases. The general direction of swirl in the vicinity of the front outer heat shield panels 18 is opposite the direction of swirl in the vicinity of the forward inner heat shield panels 22. Streams emanating from each fuel injector 86 and each fuel injector guide 88 establish the swirl direction. Accordingly, and except as noted in the next paragraph, the film cooling holes 32 in the outer front heat shield panels 18 all have a positive circumferentially oblique orientation, whereas the film cooling holes 32 in the inner front heat shield panels 22 all have a negative circumferential oblique orientation. This can be seen in FIG. 2A. The film cooling holes 32 in any given panel 18 or 22 do not have the mix of positive and negative orientations on either side of the cooling chamber mean line, as is the case with the rear heat shield panels 20 and 24.
[0041] The one exception to the cooling hole orientation described above for the heat shield panels 18 and 22 occurs in the vicinity of the axially extending rails 50 and the attachment posts 52. As shown in FIGS. 5 and 5A, the orientation of the cooling holes 32 on each side of each rail 50 is towards the respective rail 50. Further, cooling holes 32 in the vicinity of each attachment post 52 are oriented so that cooling air flows toward the attachment post 52. The cooling holes 32 are locally reversed so that film air is directed towards and over the rail 50 and the footprints of the posts 52. This is done to better cool the rail and post footprints.
