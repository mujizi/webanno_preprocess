2) Dissolve 1699 g of (high purity) silver nitrate in 2100 ml deionized water. Adjust the temperature to 50.degree. C.
3) Add sodium hydroxide solution slowly to silver nitrate solution with stirring while maintaining a temperature of 50.degree. C. Stir for 15 minutes after addition is complete, and then lower the temperature to 40.degree. C.
4) Insert clean filter wands and withdraw as much water as possible from the precipitate created in step (3) in order to remove sodium and nitrate ions. Measure the conductivity of the water removed and add back as much fresh aleionized water as was removed by the filter wands. Stir for 15 minutes at 40.degree. C. Repeat this process until the conductivity of the water removed is less than 90 .mu.mho/cm. Then add back 1500 ml deionized water.
5) Add 630 g of high-purity oxalic acid dihydrate in approximately 100 g increments. Keep the temperature at 40.degree. C. and stir to mix thoroughly. Add the last portion of oxalic acid dihydrate slowly and monitor pH to ensure that pH does not drop below 7.8.
6) Remove as much water from the mixture as possible using clean filter wands in order to form a highly concentrated silver-containing slurry. Cool the silver oxalate slurry to 30.degree. C.
