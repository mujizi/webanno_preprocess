[0016] The following means [I], [II] and [III] are provided to achieve the first to third objects.
[0017] [I] In order to achieve the first object there is provided the invention according to claims 1 to 7, which include the invention of an aqueous dispersion (X) obtained by radical polymerization reaction of a radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture (b1) in the presence of starch and/or modified starch (a) to obtain a reaction product, radical polymerization reaction of a radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture (b2) in the presence of the reaction product to obtain an acrylic modified starch (A), and then dispersing the acrylic modified starch (A) in an aqueous medium, wherein the radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture (b1) consists of less than 5% by mass of a carboxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer, 5-95% by mass of a hydroxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer and 5-95% by mass of other radical polymerizable unsaturated monomers, the radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture (b2) consists of 5-95% by mass of a carboxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer, 5-95% by mass of a hydroxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer and 0-90% by mass of other radical polymerizable unsaturated monomers, and the acid value of the acrylic modified starch (A) is in the range of 10-150 mgKOH/g.
[0018] The aqueous dispersion (X) is obtained by separate graft polymerization of a radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture for formation of a hydrophobic polymer and a radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture for formation of a hydrophilic polymer, in the presence of starch and/or modified starch, and forming an aqueous dispersion with neutralization of the carboxyl groups in the acrylic modified starch with a basic substance if necessary. It is presumed that forming hydrophobic side-chains and hydrophilic side chains on the starch and/or modified starch in this process causes the core sections and shell sections to be clearly delineated in the particles when they are dispersed in water and results in formation of firm particles, while the particle sizes are also smaller compared to an aqueous dispersion of acrylic modified starch in which hydrophilic side chains are simply introduced into starch, thus significantly improving the long-term storage stability of the acrylic modified starch aqueous dispersion.
[0019] In addition, the aqueous dispersion (X) has excellent properties while comprising biodegradable modified starch, and can be applied in a wide range of fields including not only coating materials but also inks, adhesives, molding agents and the like. However, it is especially useful when applied as a coating material because it can form coated films with excellent finished appearance, hardness, weather resistance, etc.
[0020] [II] In order to achieve the second object there are provided the inventions according to any one of claims 8 to 15, which include the invention of an aqueous dispersion (Y) obtained by radical polymerization reaction of a radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture (d1) in the presence of a radical polymerizable unsaturated group-containing starch and/or modified starch (c) to obtain a reaction product, radical polymerization reaction of a radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture (d2) in the presence of the reaction product to obtain an acrylic modified starch (C), and then dispersing the acrylic modified starch (C) in an aqueous medium, wherein the radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture (d1) comprises 5-95% by mass of a carboxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer and 5-95% by mass of a hydroxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer, the radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture (d2) comprises less than 5% by mass of a carboxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer and 5-95% by mass of a hydroxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer, and the acid value of the acrylic modified starch (C) is in the range of 10-150 mgKOH/g.
