In such a context, the Applicant has already proposed a method of improving the previously mentioned two-component method. The Applicant proposed a semi-continuous two-component method of obtaining a composite explosive charge with a polyurethane matrix, which has neither the disadvantages of the traditional "batch" method nor the aforesaid disadvantages of the two-component semi-continuous method described by J. M. TAUZIA. The said method has in particular been described in patent application EP-A-1 333 015. It has, in combination, two original technical features, one relating to the distribution of the constituents in the two components, the other relating to the weight ratio of the mixture of the said two components.
The said method is a semi-continuous method for obtaining a composite explosive charge comprising a solid polyurethane matrix, loaded with a charge, the said charge being solid and in powder form and comprising at least one nitro-organic explosive, by the introduction into a mould of a pasty explosive composition, then thermal cross-linking, the said composition being obtained by mixing constituents comprising essentially a polyol pre-polymer, a polyisocyanate monomer, a plasticising agent, and a solid charge in powder form comprising at least one nitro-organic explosive. It is characterised in that, in order to obtain the pasty explosive composition: firstly, in a discontinuous way and from all of the constituents, two components are produced by simple homogenous mixing: a pasty component A, comprising the whole of the polyol pre-polymer and the whole of the solid charge in powder form, a liquid component B, comprising the whole of the polyisocyanate monomer, the plasticising agent being distributed without distinction between the two components A and B, next, the component A and the component B are mixed continuously in such a way that the weight ratio of component A to component B is constant, being between 95/5 and 99.5/0.5.
It is important to note the two technical features of this method: the fact that the components A and B are not of the same viscosity, that one is pasty and comprises the whole of the charge and the polyol pre-polymer, and the other is liquid and comprises the whole of the polyisocyanate monomer, and this without chemical modification, in particular without any pre-polymerisation with the aid of a polyol; and the weight ratio of component A to component B is very specific.
This combination of distinctive technical features, compared to the two-component semi-continuous method according to J. M. TAUZIA, has the technical effect of eliminating all the previously mentioned disadvantages and rendering the method particularly simple and economical.
Only the component A is pyrotechnically active, which considerably reduces the safety constraints, and the mixture of the components A and B is easily rendered homogenous.
