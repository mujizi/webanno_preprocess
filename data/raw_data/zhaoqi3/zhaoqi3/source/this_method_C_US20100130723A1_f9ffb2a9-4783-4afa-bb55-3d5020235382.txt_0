[0037] Covalent attachment of polypeptides or polymers to drugs may have other pharmaceutical or agricultural benefits. For example, covalent attachment of polypeptides or polymers to drugs may serve to protect these drugs from chemical degradation in the gut or while circulating in the bloodstream by enveloping the drug within its folded structure until proteolytic digestion exposes and releases the drug from the polymer. Such protective function may also have the effect of increasing the shelf-life of the drug when purified or formulated into various pharmaceutical compositions. Depending on the specific linkage and position of the drug in the polymer, steric hindrances may also serve to lower the affinity of the drug for a particular receptor or a sub-class of binding sites until complete digestion of polymer is achieved to release the drug. Such final "activation" or release of the drug may occur at sites of action to allow for greater targeting of its effect in peripheral tissues, thus providing a "pro-pro-drug" approach that combines properties of sustained release and targeted activity. Steric protection provided by the polymer or peptide linkage to a drug may also serve to protect the drug from modification and clearance before it has had the opportunity to exert its biological effect. For example, a peptide-linked amphetamine compound may be resistant to monoamine oxidase degradation. Yet another benefit of covalent attachment of polypeptides or polymers may be improved solubility of certain drugs in aqueous environments.
[0038] A number of techniques for synthesizing polypeptide or peptide-linked molecules in vitro have been described. For example, stepwise blocking/de-blocking methods have been known in the art for many years as a way of building polypeptide molecules. However, these methods generally require multiple chemical steps for the addition of each amino acid to the polymer resulting in a time-consuming process with a low product yield.
[0039] An alternative, solution-based approach to synthesizing a peptide molecule may be achieved using a carbodiimide method. This approach generally relies on the use of a carbodiimide molecule (e.g., dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), etc.) to activate a carboxyl (e.g., --COOH) group of one compound, such as an amino acid, to produce a highly reactive intermediate which may then react and bond to other compounds or molecules, such as through an amino group of an amino acid to form a peptide bond. This method may be used to link two amino acids together or to couple an amino acid (or preformed peptide) to an active agent. However, this carbodiimide reaction scheme is not capable of self-polymerization and merely provides a coupling or linking mechanism for joining two molecules. Once a carbodiimide-activated molecule, such as a carbodiimide-activated amino acid, is allowed to react with another compound, the reaction is complete. To synthesize a polypeptide containing, for example, three or more amino acids using the carbodiimide method, a stepwise approach would be necessary to carry out repeated rounds of activation and coupling. Such a step-wise approach is a time-consuming process having a substantial reduction in yield to carry out these multiple reaction steps. Furthermore, any additional side groups which might react with a carbodiimide-activated intermediate may need to be blocked to avoid formation of unintended and undesired by-products. In addition, carbodiimides tend to form racemic mixtures of amino acids which may be incorporated into peptide-linked molecules or polymers. Considering that most naturally occurring amino acids are L-amino acids, racemization may make enzyme digestion of carbodiimide-produced polypeptides difficult or impossible, and a large proportion of active agents incorporated into carbodiimide-produced polypeptides or amino acid conjugates may be rendered inaccessible or biologically inactive. Although the addition of triazolol compounds (e.g., hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), etc.) have reduced this racemic effect, carbodiimide-based methods remain a less practical approach for synthesizing polypeptide molecules.
[0040] One effective method for synthesizing polypeptides or peptide-linked polymers that overcomes issues of racemization and non-spontaneous polymerization is the Fuchs-Farthing approach of generating highly reactive N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) intermediates of compounds or amino acids. Unlike the carbodiimide approach discussed above, this NCA-based method preserves the stereoisomeric state of compounds or amino acids incorporated into a growing polypeptide or polymer chain, i.e., such NCA-based methods are stereospecific. Thus, products formed by this method will have normal peptide bonds which may be recognized and hydrolyzed by, for example, proteases, as well as other natural enzymes.
[0041] In general, NCA-based methods for synthesizing polymers, such as polypeptides, peptide-linked compounds, etc., may involve two basic reactions: (1) formation of one or more NCA-containing monomer(s) from one or more types of monomer(s), and (2) polymerization of these monomer(s) to form a desired polymer product(s) upon introduction of at least one type of initiator. In the first reaction, NCA-containing monomer(s), which may include NCA-compounds and NCA-amino acids, may be formed by reacting one or more monomer(s) with a phosgene compound in an aprotic solvent to form a temporary N-chlorocarbonyl intermediate, which then cyclizes to form an NCA moiety of the NCA-containing monomer(s) with release of two HCl molecules (See, e.g., Example 1).
