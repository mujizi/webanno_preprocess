[0121]The ozone treated nanotubes may also be used in conjunction with a gluing agent. Ozone treated nanotubes are good starting materials since they have attachment points to stick both gluing agents and templating agents. The latter serve to retain the internal structure of the particles or mats as they dry, thus preserving the high porosity and low density of the original nanotube aggregates. Good dispersions are obtained by slurrying ozone treated nanotubes with materials such as polyethyleneimine cellulose (PEI Cell), where the basic imine functions form strong electrostatic interactions with carboxylic acid functionalized fibrils. The mix is filtered to form mats. Pyrolizing the mats at temperatures greater than 650.degree. C. in an inert atmosphere converts the PEI Cell to carbon which acts to fuse the nanotube aggregates together into hard structures. The result is a rigid, substantially pure carbon structure, which can then be further treated again with ozone if desired.
[0122]Solid ingredients can also be incorporated within the structure by mixing the additives with the nanotube dispersion prior to formation of the structure. The content of other solids in the dry structure may be made as high as fifty parts solids per part of nanotubes.
[0123]According to one preferred embodiment, nanotubes are dispersed at high shear in a highshear mixer, e.g., a Waring Blender. The dispersion may contain broadly from 0.01 to 10% nanotubes in water, ethanol, mineral spirits, etc. This procedure adequately opens nanotube bundles, i.e. tightly wound bundles of nanotubes, and disperses the nanotubes to form self-supporting mats after filtration and drying. The application of high shear mixing may take up to several hours. Mats prepared by this method, however, are not free of aggregates.
[0124]If the high shear procedure is followed by ultrasonication, dispersion is improved. Dilution to 0.1% or less aids ultrasonication. Thus, 200 cc of 0.1% fibrils, for example, may be sonified by a Bronson Sonifier Probe (450 watt power supply) for 5 minutes or more to further improve the dispersion.
[0125]To achieve the highest degrees of dispersion, i.e., a dispersion which is free or virtually free of nanotube aggregates, sonication must take place either at very low concentration in a compatible liquid, e.g., at 0.001% to 0.01% concentration in ethanol or at higher concentration e.g., 0.1% in water to which a surfactant, e.g., Triton X-100, has been added in a concentration of about 0.5%. The mat which is subsequently formed may be rinsed free or substantially free of surfactant by sequential additions of water followed by vacuum filtration. The mat thus formed can then be treated with ozone in accordance with the preferred embodiment.
