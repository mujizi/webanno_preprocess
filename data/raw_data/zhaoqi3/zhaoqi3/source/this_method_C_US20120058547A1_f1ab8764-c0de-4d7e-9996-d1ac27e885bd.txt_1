[0029] Further, the solution method of the instant invention operates in a "signal-on" mode in which the presence of target DNA results in the increment of the signal. Therefore, it is unlikely that any factor other than the presence of target DNA would lead to the appearance or enhancement of the specific electrochemical signal.
[0030] For the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid amplification product is performed in real time during the PCR reaction, it is important to note that the method and system according to this invention are thermally stable, having a negligible inhibitory effect on the PCR reaction. Also, this method is accurate, reproducible, and safe, even in the absence of an additional step of washing off of unreacted molecules, especially the soluble and non-incorporated labeled molecules and markers employed in the reaction.
[0031] When compared to optically-based devices, the present invention provides a technology that results in significantly reduced expenses; more particularly, this method may be employed in miniaturized devices, e.g. a portable real time PCR analyzer, which is currently unavailable in the market place.
