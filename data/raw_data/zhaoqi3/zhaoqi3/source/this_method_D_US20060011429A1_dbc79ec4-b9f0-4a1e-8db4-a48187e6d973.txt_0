[0137] In order to operate the above damper 600 in the optimum state, preferably, a vibration sensing device (not shown) for sensing the vibration of the tub 20 and a control unit (not shown) for controlling the damper 600 according to the vibrated state of the tub 20 are installed at designated positions of the washing machine.
[0138] When the vibration sensing device senses the vibration of the washing machine and transmits a signal to the control unit, the control unit controls current supplied to the electromagnet 645, thereby adjusting the damping force of the damper 600.
[0139] Otherwise, an alternate method for adjusting the damping force of the damper 600 may be employed. In this method, a time taken to reach the normally vibrated state of the tub 20 is input in advance to the control unit. Before the tub 20 reaches the normally vibrated state, current is supplied to the electromagnet 645 so as to increase the damping force of the damper 600, and after the tub 20 reaches the normally vibrated state, current is not supplied to the electromagnet 645 so as to decrease the damping force of the damper 600.
[0140] Hereinafter, dampers in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 9A to 11B.
[0141] Some parts of dampers in these embodiments, which are substantially the same as those of the damper in the first embodiment, are denoted by the same reference numerals even through they are depicted in different drawings, and a detailed description thereof will thus be omitted because it is considered to be unnecessary.
