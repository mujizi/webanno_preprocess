So, according to two-dimensional interpolation for averaging the pixel values of four original pixels 306-309 positioned at apexes of a rectangle, the pixel value of an interpolation pixel 310 positioned in the center of the rectangle is generated. In this way, (K-1).times.(K-1) pieces of interpolation pixels (shown by X) are generated in the reference region Sr0, as pixel values inside the prediction block Yb.
Further, in order to generate interpolation pixels outside the reference region Sr0 (e.g., pixels 305 and 311), the pixel values of original pixels which are positioned inside and adjacent to the boundary of the reference region Sr0 (e.g., pixel 303), are used as the pixel values of the interpolation pixels. To be specific, the pixel data of the pixel 304 required to generate an interpolation pixel outside the reference region Sr0 is not obtained from the pixel data inside the reference frame SF independently of the pixel data in the reference region Sr0, but the pixel data of the original pixel 303 inside the reference region Sr0 is used as the pixel value of the pixel 304.
FIG. 2(c) shows the process of generating interpolation pixels outside the reference region Sr0. In this process, as duplicates of boundary pixels positioned inside and adjacent to the reference region Sr0 (e.g., pixel 303 shown by .largecircle.), duplicate pixels (e.g., pixel 304 shown by .circle-solid.) are formed outside the reference region Sr0, in positions one-pixel-interval apart from the boundary pixels. Then, interpolation pixels (shown by X) as components of the prediction block Yb are generated outside the reference region Sr0, by using the duplicate pixels and the adjacent boundary pixels.
In this case, since the tap length of a filter used for the interpolation process is 2 in both of the horizontal and vertical directions, the number of duplicate pixels (.circle-solid.) to be formed outside the reference region Sr0 is 1+(the number of pixels in one row and one column of the reference region Sr0).
When only one of the fraction parts u and v of the motion vector MVt is 5, the pixel values of interpolation pixels are obtained by one-dimensional interpolation (bilinear interpolation). To be specific, the pixel value of one interpolation pixel is generated from two original pixels adjacent to each other. In this case, the number of duplicate pixels positioned outside the reference region Sr0 is equal to the number of pixels in one row or one column of the reference region Sr0.
