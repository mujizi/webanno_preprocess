This configuration provides the additional advantage that downstream rotors require approximately one fifth of the turning torque as that for upstream rotors, for the same mud flow rate (gpm) and rpm of the mud siren. Also, by aerodynamically tailoring different ports and lobes, the rotor can be made to rotate by itself without the assistance of a motor, in very much the way a turbine works. This reduces torque requirements even more while in operation.
A problem in conventional PSK (or even a FSK "frequency shifting") schemes lies with unscrambling the signal formed by the upcoming MWD signal and the downward one that reflects upwardly at the drill bit or Moineau motor. At short wavelengths, the signal processing requirements can be significant.
The present invention solves this problem by not generating scrambled waves in the first place. The key lies in employing the amplitude modulation of a constant, fixed-frequency, sinusoidal wave, for which the required demodulation scheme is simple.
Thus, only a "clean" coherent wave with constant frequency and variable amplitude travels uphole. Now, consider the environment at the surface.
It is well known that all downward propagating waves at the surface transducers 38 (to include mud pump noise and the downward reflection of the upward MWD signal) can be filtered and subtracted out. Also, the chances of an MWD signal reflecting downwards and then up again are practically nil. Delay line methods and other straightforward signal processing schemes, not to mention in-line desurgers, are available to handle different aspects of the noise problem.
