EXAMPLE-2
As in Example-1, various compound semiconductor thin films made of various metal sulfides can be derived by using various metal organic compounds, excluding cadmium, by using the thin film deposition device shown in FIG. 1. The characteristics of these fills are identified by using the analyzing method shown in the case of Example-1. Table 2 shows the determined optical bandgaps of various metal sulfide thin films.
As shown in Table 2, since the determined optical bandgaps of various metal sulfide thin films are nearly the same as the respective standard values, this proves that this method produces deposition of high-quality metal sulfide thin films with few lattice defects.
Although not shown in Table 2, a high-quality zinc-cadmium sulfide thin film can be obtained even when the zinc diethyldithiocarbamate and the cadmium diethyldithiocarbamate are homogeneously mixed at a predetermined ratio. This mixture is coated on a metal organic compound supplying substrate by the method shown in Example-1.
As explained in Examples -1 and -2, the metal organic compounds applicable to the evaporation and thermal decomposition method according to the present invention can be single substances or mixtures of mercaptide, thioate, dithioate, thiocarbonate, dithiocarbonate, trithiocarbonate, thiocarbamate, and dithiocarbamate of at least one metal element selected from the group consisting of copper, zinc, cadmium, mercury, and lead. In other words, the compounds containing at least one atom of the above-mentioned metal elements combined with at least one sulfur element per molecule, or the compounds containing at least carbon and nitrogen elements besides the metal elements and sulfur element, are applicable.
