The web 128 so formed is further drained of water in the press section 112 and is delivered to the dryer section 114. The dryer section 114 comprises a plurality of steam-heated drums 129. The web 128 may be processed by other well known equipment located in the MD along the process and is ultimately taken up by a web roll 130. Equipment for sensing characteristics of the web 128, illustrated as a scanning sensor 132 in FIG. 2, is located substantially adjacent to the web roll 130. It is noted that other forms of sensing equipment can be used in the present invention including stationary sensing equipment for measuring part or the entire web 128 and that sensing equipment can be positioned at other locations along the web 128.
As previously mentioned, misalignment of the CD mapping in the machine 108 can lead to deterioration in CD control performance resulting, for example, in sinusoidal patterns often referred to as "picket fence" patterns. Prior to the invention of the present application, correction of mapping misalignment has required manual adjustment of the control settings that can consume an extended period of production and may require disabling the CD control system during the correction.
One aspect of the present invention overcomes this problem by recognizing mapping misalignment, determining improved CD control settings and applying the improved CD control settings to fine tune a CD controller and thereby improve upon or correct the misalignment so that the CD controller will have improved and consistent long-term performance. The CD control of the present application is preferably included within a controller 134 for the paper making machine 108, although it can be included within a separate controller (not shown) coupled to the controller 134. The following questions are addressed herein. What regions of the CD profile exhibit mapping misalignment? How should the impact on the paper making machine 108 be measured as a result of new control settings? And, how should the CD control settings be adjusted to correct the mapping misalignment and achieve improved performance? In answer, the present invention introduces an automated optimization technique that determines the locations of mapping misalignment, establishes an effective performance indicator to measure the impact of mapping misalignment, and applies a searching technique, embodied in fuzzy logic for the illustrated embodiment, to search for and identify an improved CD mapping and to apply the improved CD mapping to the machine 108.
Another aspect of the automated optimization of the present application enables a CD control system to maintain improved long-term control performance even though CD mapping misalignment occurs randomly. Long-term control performance is automatically adjusted without manual intervention and without suspension of the CD control system. Optimization is based on specific performance indicators and, in the illustrated embodiment, on a set of fuzzy rules with a fuzzy search engine executing actions in accordance with the fuzzy rule set. The present optimization technique automatically searches for an improved CD mapping and/or smoothness changes for use as continuing CD control. Thus, operators are provided with hands-free automation and long-term consistent CD control performance.
The automated optimization of the present application compliments existing CD control systems by monitoring the CD profile as the web is produced and adjusting the control settings to improve the long-term performance of the CD control system. Automated searches can be performed periodically or triggered when measured web properties exceed selected thresholds (for example when the standard deviation of the overall CD profile is greater than about 0.5% of the process target or some other value within a range of about 0.25% to about 0.75%). Each time a search is run, the search engine can inhibit further searches for a period of time. Other searching and scheduling techniques will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the disclosure of the present application. Since the optimization search relies on operation of the CD control system, it is apparent that the CD control system cannot be interrupted or suspended during the optimization search.
