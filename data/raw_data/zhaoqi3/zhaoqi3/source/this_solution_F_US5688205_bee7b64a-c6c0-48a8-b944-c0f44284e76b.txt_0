The present invention relates to a drive device for a motor vehicle comprising an arrangement of an internal combustion engine and a gearbox of the type usually used for motorcycles.
It is known that gearboxes for motorcycles do not generally comprise synchronizing devices which, during a shift in gear ratio, enable the primary shaft and the secondary shaft to turn at speeds adapted in such a way that the gear ratio shift can take place without any resulting damage to the pinions which have to be meshed. These synchronizing devices are usual in motor vehicle gearboxes. However, for reasons of bulkiness and weight, motorcycles are not generally equipped with them.
French patent application no. 93 13768 of 18 Nov. 1993, which is the priority application of U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,309 granted Aug. 6, 1996 and assigned to the same assignee as the present application, proposed a gearbox which is of the motorcycle type, but adapted to a motor vehicle, in particular to small cars for town use, this patent application disclosing a particularly adequate solution for the mechanical design of the gearbox which makes it particularly flexible to use. In particular, this solution enables one to shift from any gear ratio into any other gear ratio, which is not usually possible with conventional gearboxes of this type. For further details, refer to the description of said patent application.
An object of the present invention is to provide a drive device for a motor vehicle such as a small car for town use, comprising in particular an internal combustion engine and a motorcycle type gearbox provided with an automatic control device, enabling the driver of the vehicle equipped with it to choose whether to make the gearbox operate either entirely automatically or manually.
The invention thus concerns a motor vehicle drive device comprising:
