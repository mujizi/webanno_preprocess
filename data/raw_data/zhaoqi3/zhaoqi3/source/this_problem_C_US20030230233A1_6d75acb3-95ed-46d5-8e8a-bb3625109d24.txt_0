[0010] The deposited SiGe layer has a low particle defect density to produce a high quality SiGe layer. A major source of particle defects during epitaxial deposition is flaking of deposits on a reactor wall. Therefore a decrease in reactor wall coating buildup generally decreases the number of particles that subsequently deposit on the SiGe layers.
[0011] One of the problems encountered when trying to extend conventional research methods of producing SiGe layers to a commercially viable process is that efforts to increase the growth rate and decrease the threading dislocation density also increase the particle defect density. This occurs because an increase in deposition temperature and an increase in precursor concentration leads to particle defects nucleating and depositing on the substrates and to an increase in coating buildup on the reactor walls, which eventually leads to flaking of the coating during growth of the SiGe layers.
[0012] This problem is exacerbated by the use of germane gas as a precursor. Germane decomposes at a much lower temperature, 675.degree. C., than its silicon precursor counterpart (i.e. 900.degree. C. for silane gas and 950.degree. C. for dichlorosilane). Thus, any increase in deposition temperature increases the amount of Ge atoms available for deposition and thus increases deposits on reactor walls and particle defects on the substrate. The result of high temperature growth with germane is the formation of a brown or black, partially opaque coating on an inner surface of the reactor. In the case of a typical lamp-heated production CVD reactor, this coating limits the transmission of radiated energy from the lamps through the quartz reactor wall to the substrate. The loss of transmissivity of the reactor, which is typically a quartz tube, causes the inner surface of the reactor to heat to a temperature above 700.degree. C., resulting in further deposits. Eventually, if left unchecked, the temperature of the reactor wall will reach 1000.degree. C., at which point devitrification occurs. Both the reactor coating and devitrification can flake from the reactor walls and deposit on the substrate.
[0013] Most applications for relaxed Si.sub.1-xGe.sub.x layers require an atomic Ge content above about 15% (x=0.15). In order to increase the Ge content in the layer, the precursor concentration of germane must be increased, thereby increasing particle defect generation.
[0014] Thus, it would be desirable to develop a method of producing relaxed SiGe layers on a semiconductor substrate that minimizes particle defect generation during deposition of SiGe layers, especially for high-Ge-content SiGe layers.
