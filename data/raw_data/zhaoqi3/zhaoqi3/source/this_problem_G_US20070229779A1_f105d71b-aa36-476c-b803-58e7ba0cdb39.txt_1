[0146] That is, as explained earlier, the curvature of field generally becomes larger as the angle of projection view becomes larger, and it is then effective to reduce the absolute value of the Petzval sum shown by Expressions (1) and (2) in order to correct the curvature of field.
[0147] However, the Petzval sum is an index based on the third-order aberration theory and indicates the curvature of field in the vicinity of the optical axis, and it does not indicate the actual state of the curvature of field in the optical system of the preferred embodiment that uses only part of a high angle-of-view portion separated far from the optical axis.
[0148] Also, in general, in a lens structure that reduces the Petzval sum, when the total lens length is kept constant, the light rays must be bent at sharper angles and lenses with large powers are required, and then the lenses exhibit increased sensitivity to decentering. When the angles at which the light rays are bent are kept constant in order to solve this problem, the total lens length is lengthened.
[0149] However, since the projecting optical system of the image projector 100 of this preferred embodiment employs only a part of a high angle-of-view portion separated far from the optical axis, the curvature of field in the actually employed, limited range of angle of projection view can be satisfactorily corrected even if the Petzval partial sum of the lenses is not necessarily small.
[0150] Accordingly, in the image projector 100, the lenses of the projecting optical system were designed intensively to achieve simplification of the lens structure, reduction of sensitivity to decentering, and enhanced performance like enhanced resolving power and enhanced distortion correcting ability, without a need to stick to the reduction of the Petzval partial sum of lenses.
