In the sodium decomposition method, the organic halogen-containing compounds are decomposed with sodium at a high decomposition efficiency. However, since this method consumes a large amount of the sodium material, it is economically disadvantageous. Moreover, in the apparatus for carrying out this method, it is necessary to provide much equipment for ensuring operational safety during handling of the sodium material. As a result, this apparatus requires a large space for installation.
Of the above-described decomposition methods, the ultraviolet radiation method has been recently improved and suggested for decomposition of chlorine-containing compounds. In this improved method, for increasing the velocity of decomposition reaction, the chlorine-containing compounds are dissolved in an alcohol solvent which contains an alkaline metal material, and ultraviolet rays are used to irradiate that solution. In this reaction system, the chloride compound, i.e. hydrogen chloride produced by the decomposition reaction, forms a salt with the alkaline metal in the solution, and the salt is precipitated and removed from the solution. Accordingly, hindrance of the decomposition reaction by the decomposed product can be prevented.
However, in the above-described ultraviolet irradiation method, the alcohol molecules of the solvent may be transferred to the corresponding aldehyde or ketone form in the reaction system by ultraviolet radiation, and the aldehyde, ketone and the like are polymerized in the presence of the alkaline material in accordance with the aldol condensation reaction. This reaction badly affects the reaction system to make it difficult to repeat the decomposition operation. Therefore, this method is poor in practice.
As described above, each of the conventional decomposition methods has been associated with problems hindering the actual use, and no technique for actual use is as yet known.
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of decomposing an organic halogen-containing compound with ultraviolet radiation in which the decomposition efficiency can be highly improved and which is suitable for use in practice.
