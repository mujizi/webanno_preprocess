EXAMPLE 51D
2-(4-Cyano-6-fluoro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-2-methyl-pyrrolidine-1-carboxyl-ic acid benzyl ester
[0227] A solution of Example 1B (574 mg, 2.18 mmol) in methylene chloride (8 mL) was treated with oxalyl chloride (285 .mu.L, 3.27 mmol) and one drop of DMF at room temperature for 1 hour. After concentration, the residue was dissolved in methylene chloride (8 mL) and the solution was added to a solution of Example 51C (329 mg, 2.18 mmol) and triethylamine (364 .mu.L, 2.62 mmol) in THF (8 mL). This reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight before it was concentrated. The residue was dissolved in 15 mL of acetic acid and this solution was heated at 100.degree. C. for 1 hour. After cooling, the acetic acid was removed by rotavapor and the residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic layer was washed with sodium bicarbonate solution, water and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (silica gel, 20-70% gradient EtOAc in hexane) to give Example 51D (679 mg, 82%). MS (DCI/NH.sub.3) m/z 379 (M+H).sup.+.
