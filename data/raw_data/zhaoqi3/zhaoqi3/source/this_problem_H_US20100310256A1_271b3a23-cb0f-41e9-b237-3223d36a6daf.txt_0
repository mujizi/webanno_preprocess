[0006] In a coherent receiver, the QPSK incoming optical signal is mixed with a strong local oscillators to produce in-phase (I) and in-quadrature (Q) outputs. I and Q components of the output optical signal are converted into electrical signals by a set of photodetectors. In the preferred configuration four balanced photodetectors are used to recover QPSK encoded data.
[0007] Data transmission multiplexing light of two orthogonal polarizations via the same optical channel allows doubling the data rate. At the receiver side, the orthogonal polarizations are split by a polarization beam splitter, and the light of each orthogonal polarization is detected separately.
[0008] There is still a need to increase the transmission rate and provide a reliable detection scheme to improve the high-rate data processing at the receiver side, and the present invention addresses this problem thus allowing achieving more reliable systems operating at higher data rates.
[0009] A number of architectural solutions have been proposed in order to reduce the data rate at the receiver, to split high rate flow into a number of parallel branches and process lower rate signal in each branch digitally. In particular this approach is useful in systems that use standard ADCs with a sampling rate close to the Nyquist rate (e.g 25 Gsps).
[0010] The WDM system of the present invention includes multiple channels, each channel being able to transmit up to 1 TBit/s data stream. It is achieved by forming the channel bandwidth as a set of non-overlapping spectral bands being orthogonal to each other. Transmitting of such spectral bands does not require a guard band between them thus achieving high spectral efficiency and better utilization of the fiber band. In the preferred embodiment the set of spectral bands is formed by an optical comb generator. The data is embedded using OFDM with M-PSK modulation format, in the preferred embodiment it is QPSK format (quadrature phase shift keying). Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing of the signal in each spectral band allows achieving high data rate transmission and improved robustness to the spectral dispersion and PMD.
