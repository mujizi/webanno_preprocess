[0006] The assembly of skin plus stringers can be manufactured in a single process (called one-shot), by which the skin, conical or cylindrical, is obtained together with the stringers in one piece, or alternatively said assembly of skin plus stringers can be manufactured separately in several panels (panelled solution) that are then joined together mechanically.
[0007] With regard to the frames, these can be, according to the prior art, floating or complete. In the case of the complete frames used at present, the manufacturing process is carried out in a large number of steps. The frames are manufactured separately, in several sections, and are joined mechanically to the skin, taking the form of said skin on resting on it. The problem posed by these known complete frames is that it is necessary to use complicated and expensive tooling to achieve the assembly tolerances required to enable said frames to be joined to the skin, taking into account the precise aerodynamic and structural requirements.
[0008] For the case of floating frames, the known manufacturing process also consists of several steps. The frames are manufactured separately but, apart from the sections that are required as a function of the panelling of the skin, the cross-section will consist of two different pieces: on the one hand, the floating frame as such and, on the other hand, the foot (piece called "babette" or "shear tie") which is joined to the skin by means of rivets, and in its turn the floating frame itself is riveted to the aforesaid foot. With this solution, manufacturing of the floating frame is simplified, so that, as it is not necessary to copy the shape of the skin, the tooling used is simpler, and at the same time the problem of assembly tolerances is improved. However, this known solution of floating frames has the drawback of increasing the number of parts, and therefore the number of joints required.
[0009] In the two cases already known, complete frames and floating frames, different assembly stations are needed and a large quantity of fasteners (basically rivets), which involves weight penalties, high costs of production and assembly, and the need for greater logistic capacity.
[0010] That is why in recent years much effort has been devoted to achieving an ever increasing level of integration in the production of fuselages in composite material, so as to avoid the disadvantages of the aforementioned known solutions. The problem caused by this integration resides basically in creating sufficient pressure in all the elements during the process of combined curing.
