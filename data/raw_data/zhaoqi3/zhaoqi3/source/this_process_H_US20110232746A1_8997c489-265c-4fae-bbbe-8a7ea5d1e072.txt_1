[0140] On the front side, the thick-film paste composition 500 of the present invention sinters and penetrates through the insulating film 30 during firing, and thereby achieves electrical contact with the n-type diffusion layer 20. This type of process is generally called "fire through." This fired-through state, i.e., the extent to which the paste melts and passes through the insulating film 30, depends on the quality and thickness of the insulating film 30, the composition of the paste, and on the firing conditions. When fired, the paste 500 becomes the electrode 501, as shown in FIG. 1(f).
[0141] In one embodiment, the insulating film is selected from titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, silicon nitride, SiN.sub.x:H, silicon oxide, silicon carbon oxynitride, a silicon nitride film containing carbon, a silicon oxide film containing carbon, and silicon oxide/titanium oxide films. The silicon nitride film can be formed by sputtering, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), or a thermal CVD process. In one embodiment, the silicon oxide film is formed by thermal oxidation, sputtering, or thermal CVD or plasma CVD. The titanium oxide film can be formed by coating a titanium-containing organic liquid material onto the semiconductor substrate and firing, or by thermal CVD.
[0142] In one embodiment of this process, the semiconductor substrate can be single-crystal or multi-crystalline silicon.
[0143] Suitable insulating films include one or more components selected from: aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, silicon nitride, SiN.sub.x:H, silicon oxide, and silicon oxide/titanium oxide. In one embodiment of the invention, the insulating film is an anti-reflection coating (ARC). The insulating film can be applied to a semiconductor substrate, or it can be naturally forming, such as in the case of silicon oxide.
[0144] In one embodiment, the insulating film includes a layer of silicon nitride. The silicon nitride can be deposited by CVD (chemical vapor deposition), PECVD (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition), sputtering, or other methods.
