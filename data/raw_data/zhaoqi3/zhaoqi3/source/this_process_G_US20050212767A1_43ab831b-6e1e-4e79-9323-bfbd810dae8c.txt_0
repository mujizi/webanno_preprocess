[0060] The selection and amplification of the dominant motion and minimization of other motion may further expand a user's ability to take advantage of motion user interfaces and may also allow the handheld device, or applications running on the device, to filter out undesired, user-induced noise. With this capability, the user may be able to, for example, move the device left to pick a list to examine, then scroll that list by moving up and down. Motion along inappropriate axes may be ignored or substantially reduced by the device.
[0061] In particular embodiments, the selection and amplification of a dominant motion and minimization of other motion may also be applied to rotational motion of the device. Dominant motion around an axis may be selected and amplified in the same manner as motion along an axis as described above with respect to translational motion. Moreover, rotation around another axis (that is not dominant rotation) may be minimized.
[0062] FIG. 6 illustrates a preferred motion selection flowchart 60, in accordance with a particular embodiment of the present invention. In flowchart 60, raw data corresponding to movement of a handheld device is received. In the illustrated embodiment, the movement raw data includes x-acceleration data 62a, y-acceleration data 62b and z-acceleration data 62c that is processed at step 64 to yield an output indicating movement of the device. Other embodiments may include other types of movement raw data, such as optical or camera data, gyro data and/or rangefinder data. After the processing of the raw acceleration data 62, a dominant axis of motion is selected at step 66. If the selected dominant axis of motion is the x-axis, then the movement along the x-axis is augmented at step 68a. If the selected dominant axis of motion is the y-axis, then the movement along the y-axis is augmented at step 68b. If the selected dominant axis of motion is the z-axis, then the movement along the z-axis is augmented at step 68c. The amount of augmentation of movement in the dominant axis of motion may vary in different embodiments according to the application being utilized or other characteristics. In some embodiments, user preferences 69 may be utilized to determine type or amount of movement augmentation. Movement along axes other than the dominant axis of motion may be minimized as discussed above, such that such movement is ignored by a particular application in use. At step 70, the augmented movement is processed to yield device behavior 72. This processing step may include accessing an application being used to determine the particular device behavior to perform based on the augmented movement. Augmented movement may yield any of a number of types of device behavior according to the application in use, a particular user or otherwise.
[0063] For particular user interfaces utilizing motion input, there may be value in having the position of a virtual display, or the information displayed at display 12 of handheld device 10, linked to the position of the device. For example, in particular embodiments using translation-based input such as for navigating a map displayed at the device, the position of the handheld device may directly determine the portion of the map displayed at display 12. However, if device position information is kept in absolute terms (e.g., as with global positioning satellite (GPS) based systems) the utility for many tasks such as map or menu navigation may be impaired. Thus, it is beneficial in certain circumstances to define a "zero point," or an origin in a local context, that may be used to determine the behavior of the device. For example, if a zero point is defined when the device is at a point A, then motion between point A and a point B may be used as input. Particularly useful applications of setting a zero point may include external behaviors such as moving the virtual display or locating applications in the space around a user's body. Setting a zero point also addresses internal behaviors such as instructing the device to ignore the gravitational acceleration at the current orientation to allow the device to act only on additional, and presumably user generated, accelerations.
[0064] Handheld devices according to particular embodiments may include application user interfaces that utilize motion input only at certain times. At other times, for example, the motion of the device may not be utilized as input, and it may be useful to disengage or "turn off" motion sensitivity or the motion detection capability of the device. Disengagement of motion sensitivity may comprise, for example, deactivation of motion detector 22 of device 10 or other component, such as a motion response module of the device. Particular embodiments thus allow for the selective engagement and disengagement of the motion sensitivity of the device.
