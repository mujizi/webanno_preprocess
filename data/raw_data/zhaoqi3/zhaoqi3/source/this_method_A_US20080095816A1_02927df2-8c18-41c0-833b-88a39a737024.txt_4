[0102] Any of these crosslinking agents can contain one, two, three or more active chemical groups to bring about the formation of a one-, two-, or three-dimensional polymeric network, in order to create proper adhesion between the polyphosphazene polymer and the silicone-containing substrate.
[0103] Other ways of chemically bonding a polyethyleneimine film on the surface of a silicone substrate include, but are not limited to, reaction of ethyleneimine monomer ("aziridine") gas with a properly-activated silicone surface. The activated surface provides chemically reactive units that bond the monomers and initiate polymerization of the subsequent units. This activation usually involves oxidative pre-treatment methods described herein to form surface silicone hydroxyl groups.
[0104] In one aspect of this disclosure, one useful method for preparing and activating the silicone is activation of a silicone surface by plasma, and the dosing of ethyleneimine (aziridine) gas into the plasma chamber. In this procedure, a homogeneous or near homogeneous tie layer of polyethyleneimine is formed on the surface of the substrate. One advantage of this method lies in the covalent bonding of the aziridine which results by ring opening to the substrate and forming a C--O ether bond that results by nucleophile attack of the hydroxyl groups located on the silica/silicone surface. The remaining amino functionality is then available for reacting with further aziridine molecules, or available for forming a layer of positively charged amino groups that will physically attract a negatively charged polyphosphazene polymer film.
[0105] Other suitable chemical activation methods of a silicone surface in order to incorporate (poly) ethyleneimine can include, but are not limited to, the conversion of surface Si--OH (hydroxyl) groups into more reactive groups, like halide groups (F, Cl, Br, or I), especially chloride groups, by the use of a chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride, phosphorus chloride, phosphorus oxychloride, and/or oxalyl dichloride. The reaction of a water-free, anhydrous (poly)ethyleneimine (for example, dissolved in an organic solvent or using ethyleneimine monomer gas) with this type of activated (chlorinated) silicone surface can generate a homogeneous or near homogeneous tie layer on the silicone surface.
[0106] The polyethyleneimine layer can also be bonded to the silicone by the use of an intermediate (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) layer between the silicone and the (poly)ethyleneimine (PEI). Subsequent crosslinking can then occur between the amino-end groups of the APTMS tie layer and the amino groups of the (poly) ethyleneimine (PEI). In the case of using alkoxysilanes as adhesion promoters, one solvent of choice that is very useful is the analogous alcohol that results from the hydrolysis of the silicone precursor, which for APTMS, is methanol.
