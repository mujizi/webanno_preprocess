It can thus be noted that a spiral-shaped fabric obtained according to patent FR-2 490 687 has great variations in surface mass, particularly in the vicinity of the limits between two contiguous sections, even if the average surface mass over the whole of the fabric corresponds to the desired mass. Furthermore, this fabric has variations in thickness. The fabric obtained therefore does not have good homogeneity and the appearance of this fabric, as well as its mechanical characteristics, has irregularities.
The very old patent FR 454 993 can also be cited, which describes a method of weaving to obtain curved fabrics which do not require the division of the fabric into defined sections.
However, this method does not make it possible to obtain a spiral fabric, because the warp and weft yarns are unwound in one plane, without it being possible to obtain superimposed and centered annular turns. Furthermore, the curved fabric is obtained by providing additional weft strokes in a regular and sequential manner and cannot therefore have good homogeneity in thickness and in surface mass. Consequently, the appearance of this fabric, as well as its mechanical characteristics, has irregularities.
The subject of the invention is a spiral-shaped textile structure having great uniformity of thickness, of surface mass, of compactness, and consequently, of its mechanical characteristics.
The invention thus relates to a spiral-shaped textile structure comprising warp yarns across which are passed successive rows of weft yarns, the warp yarns being essentially arranged in helices having the same axis, so that the fabric forms superimposed annular turns centered on the axis.
