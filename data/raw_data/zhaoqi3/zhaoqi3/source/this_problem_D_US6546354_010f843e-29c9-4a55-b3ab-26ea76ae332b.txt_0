In a situation such as that described by equation 12 above, sensor values (i.e., two accelerations and two forces) are known from measurements and two counterbalance forces are unknown. This results in a situation where there are more equations than unknowns as each sensor provides an equation and there are only two unknown counterbalance forces for the front and back planes of the drum. This condition describes an over-determined system. An over-determined system may have more than one possible solution and a technique is generally required to solve for more equations than unknowns in an optimal manner.
A technique for solving equations of this type in a balancing scheme should find a solution that minimizes all of the sensor readings and also minimizes the amount of counterbalance media required to balance the rotating system or rotating device. In other words, the force sensors and the accelerometers should all be driven as close to zero as possible by the selected counterbalances and the total amount of counterbalance media (i.e., fluid or mass) applied should be minimized.
Those skilled in the art can appreciate that a mathematical technique which may solve this problem involves computation of the pseudo-inverse of the A matrix (A.sup.+) utilizing the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique. This solution method finds the optimal solution to the over-determined system shown in equation 9. The SVD is one of several techniques that can support the pseudo-inverse calculation for control. It can provide optimal control for both inputs and outputs of the modeled system. Other variations of the components that make up the SVD may be used alone but would not provide both input and output optimization. This procedure is fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,993 and is well known to those skilled in the art. It is also described in significant detail in various reference linear algebra textbooks.
After generating the solution to equation 12, it may be necessary to formulate a practical approach to applying the counterbalance mass to the rotating member. Further, after the control action is applied, it may be necessary to evaluate the member to verify that the control action had the desired balancing affect. An approach to applying counterbalance and verifying the control action effect is fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,993, which is incorporated herein by reference. Those skilled in the art can appreciate that the approaches to applying counterbalance and verifying the control action effect, which were disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,993, do not limit the scope of the present invention. The features, techniques, methods and systems disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,993 are described herein for illustrative and background purposes only.
In an ideal system, the force applied to the rotating portion of the member is linearly related to the force and motion that the sensors measure. In this ideal system the placement of the optimal counterbalances determined by the solving the system in the manner described herein should drive all of the sensors to zero and achieve perfect balance of the rotating member. For various reasons, however it is not expected that an ideal system exists and certain system balance, operational safety, and physical constraints need to be considered.
