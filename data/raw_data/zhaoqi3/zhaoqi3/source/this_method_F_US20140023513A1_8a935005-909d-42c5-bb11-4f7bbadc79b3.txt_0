[0050] One method of identifying the outer surface of the agglomerate is using scanning electron microscopy at a magnification between 200.times.-5000.times. in the back-scattered electrons (BSE) mode, where the fibers will have a consistent shade intensity, the resin another, and the agglomerates may have a third shade intensity and may have a distinct pattern. The external edge of the effective area is then defined by a change in the image intensity from either agglomerate to fiber or agglomerate to resin. In the case that this edge is a gradual transition, threshold shade intensity can be used to consistently define a line for each image. The area of the agglomerate can then be obtained by measuring the area enclosed by the outer boundary. If the agglomerate has large holes or cracks within the external boundary, the cracks or holes can be traced around and their area subtracted from the area enclosed by the external border. The total area for all agglomerates is then divided by the area of the fibers in the image to give a percentage. A non-limiting group of other imaging methods could be used to identify these surfaces including: light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scanning.
[0051] The SEM in FIG. 9 of a agglomerated particle cloud network composite has been redrawn in FIG. 10 to highlight the external edges between agglomerated nanoparticle and resin or fibers. In FIG. 10, the agglomerated nanoparticles 210 have edges defined by the fibers 110 and resin 300. The agglomerated nanoparticles 210 contain individual nanoparticles 220 (sized not to scale). The resin 300 fills an area of a crack in the nanoparticle agglomerate 210. The total area of nanoparticles 210 can then be divided by the total area of the Figure to obtain the effective cross sectional area of the agglomerates relative to a small sample of the bundle. In a typical measurement, 100 or more fibers and their interstitial spaces should be included in the SEM to produce a more representative measurement relative to the bulk average.
[0052] For example, FIG. 4B is converted from FIG. 4A by using this method. The percentage of effective area of agglomerated particles to the fiber bundle can be calculated by using image analysis software such as Adobe Photoshop, MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox, or Image-Pro to count the number of pixels in the agglomerated particle area divided by total number of pixels in the image. The percentage of effective area of agglomerated particles to the fibers can be calculated by using image analysis software such as Adobe Photoshop, MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox, or Image-Pro to count the number of pixels in the agglomerated particle area divided by total number of pixels in the fiber region. Based on this method, the effective area of agglomerated particles to the whole fiber bundle is 15.7%. The effective area of agglomerated particles to the fibers is 24.2%.
[0053] Typically, measurements of the bundle of fibers are taken after infusion because cutting a bundle of fibers may produce a large amount of debris which can make identifying the bridges difficult. Moreover, during SEM, the fibers and bridges may develop an electrostatic potential, possibly causing them to move and making imaging significantly more difficult. Finally, it is difficult to obtain a straight and perpendicular cut through the fiber bundle in order to have a flat cross section to measure. It believed that the cloud structure in the agglomerated particle cloud network coated fiber bundle is substantially the same as the cloud structure in the agglomerated particle cloud network composite. The reasons behind this belief include 1) the flow velocity of resin in the fiber bundles is driven by capillary forces and hence is low, so there is little chance of bridges getting washed away or moved, 2) bridges are adhered to the surface of the fibers (i.e. typically cannot be washed off), 3) bridges form to the contour of the fibers, thus, if the fibers twist in the bundle and the space between fibers changes shape the solid agglomerates will not be able to push through the tortuous path (they could possibly slide down the center of an ordered array of fibers) so they have limited mobility within the bundle 4) the size of the bridges is large relative to the separation distance between fibers, so they will have trouble getting out of a fiber bundle, 5) experiments showed that the shape of agglomerated particles doesn't change after it is immersed in resin in the time scale of resin curing time. This suggests that the agglomerated particles are not able to be dissolved or re-dispersed in resin.
[0054] Agglomerated particle cloud network coated fiber bundles may be measured before infusion if they are held in place, for instance by pulling out a single tow from a fabric then wrapping it in heat shrink tubing and shrinking the tubing before cleaving it to image a cross section. FIG. 5 shows an SEM image taken by this method. One can see the bridging structure between adjacent fibers before resin infusion. While this provides a better image, it does not yield a flat surface that can be used for quantification.
