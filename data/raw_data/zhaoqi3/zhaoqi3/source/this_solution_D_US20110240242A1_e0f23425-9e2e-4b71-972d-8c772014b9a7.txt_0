[0098] Embodiments of the system of the present invention may comprise: a source of a paper surface sizing composition comprising above about 10% surface sizing starch solids, wherein the surface sizing starch solids comprise from 0 to about 95% high fatty acid surface sizing starch and from about 5 to 100% low fatty acid surface sizing starch; a starch cooking stage which cooks the surface sizing starch solids in the paper surface sizing composition and thus liberates fatty acids from the cooked surface sizing starch solids, wherein the liberated fatty acids comprise no more than about 300 ppm (e.g., no more than about 250 ppm) C.sub.16 or higher saturated fatty acids; a fatty acid neutralization stage which neutralizes and converts the liberated fatty acids in the cooked paper surface sizing composition to monovalent fatty acid salts; a source of a multivalent metal drying salt; and a paper surface sizing device wherein at least one surface of a paper substrate is treated with the neutralized paper surface sizing composition and the multivalent metal drying salt.
[0099] It has been found, for example, that high fatty acid surface sizing starches such as non-waxy cereal starches (e.g., non-way maize (corn) starch or non-waxy wheat starch) used in paper surface sizing compositions, when cooked, may liberate significant amounts of fatty acids and especially saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid. For example, corn starch and wheat starch may comprise upwards of as much as about 1% fatty acids which may be liberated during starch cooking, of which upwards of as much as about 35% of these fatty acids comprise palmitic acid.
[0100] Because starch is generally insoluble in cold water, an aqueous suspension of starch granules and water is often formed, which is then heated (cooked) to enable the water to penetrate the starch granules and thus cause these cooked granules to swell to provide a gelatinized paste or solution of cooked starch solids. After the high fatty acid starch is cooked, this solution of cooked starch solids contains liberated fatty acids which may then be neutralized with a monovalent hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide (e.g., 1N), such that the neutralized solution has a pH, for example, of up to about 7.5, to control the pH of the cooked starch solution. This neutralized starch solution comprises monovalent fatty acids, including monovalent saturated fatty acid salts, such as sodium palmitate.
[0101] To provide energy savings, increased surface strength in the paper substrate, increased additive efficiency in the paper surface sizing composition, etc., it may be desirable to use a cooked starch solution having a relatively high level of surface sizing starch solids (i.e., above about 10% starch solids). When the level of cooked high fatty acid starch solids is relatively high, the amount of fatty acids, and in particular saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, which are liberated may also be relatively high. For example, at starch solids levels greater than about 10%, it has been calculated that the amount of palmitic acid present in these cooked high fatty acid starch solutions may be above about 300 ppm or even above about 400 ppm. When these cooked high fatty acid starch solutions are neutralized, the resulting neutralized starch solution may also provide a relatively high level of saturated fatty acid salts, such as sodium palmitate.
[0102] After cooking and neutralization, these neutralized paper surface sizing compositions comprising higher amounts of, for example, high fatty acid surface sizing starch solids (and thus higher levels of saturated fatty acids salts) may then be applied to the surface of the paper substrate, for example, at a size press. When a source of multivalent cations, such as calcium chloride, used as a metal drying salt agent, is also introduced at the size press (e.g., at levels of at least about 0.1% (i.e., 1000 ppm), for example, as a solution of calcium chloride, multivalent saturated fatty acid salts, such as calcium palmitate, may be formed. These multivalent saturated fatty acid salts, such as calcium palmitate, which are formed by adding the multivalent metal drying salt (e.g., calcium chloride) solution at the size press may cause these multivalent saturated fatty acid salts (e.g., calcium palmitate) which are at relatively high levels to precipitate out of paper surface sizing compositions. These precipitated multivalent saturated fatty acid salts (e.g., calcium palmitate) may then form undesirable multivalent saturated fatty acid salt deposits on the size press or on other equipment, devices, etc., after the size press.
