[0115] The moveable side walls must also provide fire and water protection. Despite the use of protection gaskets at the joints, an external telescopic joint as shown in FIG. 7 can be placed along the perimeter of the moveable part protecting the joint from direct exposure to the environment. The telescopic joint follows the movement of the side walls, ceiling and flooring. The joints are suited to any expansion conditions due to external conditions (heat, cold, ice . . . ) as depicted graphically in FIG. 6.
[0116] As mentioned earlier, racks are organized within the portable data center, or in particular within the inner room or Smart Shelter. Such racks are metal enclosures that can securely hold various types of IT equipment (e.g., computers, machines, servers, storage devices, etc). Due to the need to optimize space usage within the PMDC, and in order to facilitate access to operators to front and rear parts of the racks, the racks are mounted on a sliding rail guided system. The rails are made of light material, on which the ball bearing skates slide within. There are two rails per rack, and two skates per rail (total four skates). On top of the skates, there is a flat metal plate screwed in, on which we screw the racks' base. Thus, each rack is supported on four skates. FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate an exemplary rack sliding rail system.
[0117] This system is heavy duty, so it can manage loads >500 kg load per skate on the guiding plates with no problem. The racks will then glide on the flat plates, allowing easy access to the front and back of the rack. In such reduced space as the PMDC, this solution provides a significant advantage as it improves the working environment by providing good access for equipment installation (front) and access for maintenance purposes (rear).
[0118] As discussed, each rack is supported on two rails, and 4 skates slide within. Each skate has 3 wheels. The metal plate sits across the rails, bolted to each pair of skates, on top of which the rack is located. This system allows a longitudinal movement.
[0119] The travel speed of the base with a maximum load can be >8 m/s, and the length of the tracks is as long as the width of the PMDC even with extended walls. Rails can be mounted on top of extended flooring system with some height supports to extend its travel. The rails have stoppers at its end in order to lock the position of racks and work as bumpers during movement of the racks.
