[0121] where d is the interval between the conversion elements 54, C is the acoustic wave propagation speed in the subject 7, and Fo is the transmission convergence point.
[0122] The output from the rate signal generating unit 21, which has been delayed by the transmission delay time of equation (2), is supplied to the pulsers 52, driving the conversion elements 54. The conversion elements generate driving pulses, which will be used to irradiate the subject 7 with ultrasonic waves. Outputs of the pulsers 52, i.e., driving signals for the conversion elements 54, are supplied via the electronic switch 53 to the N' conversion elements 54-1 to 54-N' of the M arrayed conversion elements 54. The elements 54-1 to 54-N' generate transmission ultrasonic waves. The subject 7 is irradiated with the transmission ultrasonic waves.
[0123] In the subject 7, some of the ultrasonic waves are reflected by the interface between the organs, or the different tissues, or by the acoustic scatters in the living body tissue. The conversion elements 54 receive the waves reflected, as reception ultrasonic waves, and convert them into an electrical signal. The electronic switch 53 selects the ultrasonic wave reception signals obtained by the conversion elements 54-1 to 54-N. These N'-channel reception signals are sent to the reception delay circuits 56 via the preamplifiers 55. The signals are delayed by delay times and then supplied to the adder 57. The adder 57 adds or combines the N'-channel ultrasonic reception signals, generating a signal. This signal is subjected to noise removal, logarithmic compression in the filter 66, logarithmic transformation unit 58. It is then subjected to envelope detection in the envelope detector 59. The signal, which is an analog signal, is converted to digital image data. In the image data, thus obtained in the first scan, is stored into the image data memory B 62. At the time of reception, the dynamic convergence method is preferably used. This method is the same as the photoacoustic imaging method described above, and will not be described in detail.
[0124] The same procedure as performed in the first scan is repeated, carried out the second and subsequent scans. In the second scan, the electronic switch 53 selects the conversion elements 54-2 to 54-N'+1. In the third scan, the electronic switch 53 selects the conversion elements 54-3 to 54-N'+2. Ultrasonic waves are then transmitted and received. This operation is repeated until the conversion elements 54-M-N+1 to 54-M are selected and driven. The transmission delay circuits 51 converge transmission ultrasonic beams. The reception delay circuits 56 converge reception ultrasonic beams. The method of setting delay times will not be described in detail, because it is almost identical to the method employed in the photoacoustic imaging method.
[0125] Thereafter, the one-frame image data obtained by the pulse echo method is stored into the image data memory B 62 of the signal processing unit 25. After the photoacoustic image data and ultrasonic image data are completely acquired, the system control unit 4 reads both image data items from the image data memory A 61 and image data memory B 62. The image data items are combined in the display image memory 63 and temporarily stored therein. The combined image data is supplied to the converter 64. The converter 64 performs D/A conversion and TV format conversion on the combined image data. The resultant image data is displayed on the CRT monitor 65.
