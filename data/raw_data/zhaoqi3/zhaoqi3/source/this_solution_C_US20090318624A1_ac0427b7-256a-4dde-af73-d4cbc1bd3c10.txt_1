5.5 Example 4
[0181] This example involved re-ionization of an isolated and purified PIB sample carrying tert-chloride end groups. The quencher was ethoxytrimethylsilane.
[0182] The tert-chloride-terminated PIB was produced according to the following procedure: A stirred 1000 mL glass reactor was equilibrated to -60.degree. C. within the glove box. To the reactor were added 361.3 mL hexane, 240.9 mL MeCl, 5.72 mL (0.034 mol, 0.045 M) TMPCl, 122.7 mL (2.0 M) IB, 0.87 mL (0.01 M) 26Lut, and 18.5 mL (0.17 mol, 0.22 M, 5.times.CE) TiCl.sub.4. The polymerization reaction proceeded for 15 min, reaching a maximum temperature of -37.4.degree. C. After full conversion of the IB, prechilled MeOH was added to terminate the reaction. Upon removal from the dry box, the terminated reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. Hexane was added to the polymer and then the solution was washed several times each with MeOH, acidic DI water, and DI water. The final sample was dried in vacuo at room temp to remove any remaining solvents prior to NMR and GPC analysis. The theoretical M.sub.n for the masterbatch polymer was 2,650 g/mol and GPC-MALLS analysis of the product using a dn/dc of 0.111 yielded M.sub.n=2,850 g/mol and PDI=1.03. A stock solution of the masterbatch polymer was created by dissolving 11.553 g of the polymer in 60 mL hexane. The molar concentration of this solution was 0.061 mol/L, based on the theoretical M.sub.n of the polymer.
[0183] NMR analysis of the end group composition (%) yielded the following:
