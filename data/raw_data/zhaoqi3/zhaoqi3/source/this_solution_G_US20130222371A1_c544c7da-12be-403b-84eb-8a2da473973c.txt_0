Self-Architecting Adaptive Network Solution
[0295] A self-architecting adaptive network solution system includes embodiments of the present technology. This system automates the design and training of high-complexity self-adaptive networks comprised of a neural-network processing capability, an automated training environment, multilevel cooperative and competitive models, recursive integration with other networks, digital logic elements, and various parametric transforms regulating dynamic redesign, training and feedback.
[0296] Specifically, the novelty about this solution approach is at least the following: (1) self-architecting, self-adapting capability; (2) recursive modularity within the context of both architecture and adaptation; (3) the approach to the reduction of local minima/maxima traps; and (4) the optional use of an adaptive model to optimize training in resource-limited environments.
[0297] (1) Self-Architecting, Self-Adapting Capability
[0298] Regarding the self-architecting/self-adapting capability, multiple network training cycles to automate both the weighting of network connections and the redesign of the network architecture itself are introduced, including a number of nodes, specific connections between nodes, node thresholds, etc. Further, a unique approach to sexual and asexual reproduction is utilized. Additionally, the parametric redesign utilizes a trained network or parametric transform.
