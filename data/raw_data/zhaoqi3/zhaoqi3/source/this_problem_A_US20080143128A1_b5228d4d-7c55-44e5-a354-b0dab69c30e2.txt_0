[0005]Various manufacturers make corrugated floors for refrigerated bodies. The channels are generally parallel and run the length of the floor. The distance between channels of a corrugation may vary considerably from one container to another, and from one manufacturer to another, because of the lack of manufacturing standards for such flooring. Also, although the recessed corrugations in pre-fabricated sheets are often regularly spaced, variations in spacing may occur across a particular corrugated floor because most floors, especially in large trailers or containers, are fabricated from multiple one foot or two foot wide pre-fabricated segments joined together. At the seams, there is an overlap of the floor segments, and therefore, the channel depth at or near the overlap is typically less than it is for the other channels of the corrugated floor. Additionally, the spacing between channels on either side of a joint can be closer or farther apart than that between the channels on the remainder of the floor. Further, near the edge of the floor, i.e., at the wall of the container or trailer, there are typically no channels; instead there is a wider segment of uncorrugated flooring immediately adjacent to the trailer or container wall.
[0006]Single tined implements have been partially effective in cleaning corrugated surfaces, but the process of cleaning each recessed channel or corrugation individually is excessively time consuming. Moreover, there is a tendency for debris removed from one channel to fall into an adjacent, previously cleaned channel.
[0007]An attempt to solve this problem is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,229,032 [Murphy], which describes a hand manipulated pusher blade having a plurality of uniformly spaced downwardly extending teeth protruding a fixed vertical distance below the pusher blade. The pusher blade is rotatable in and out of position over the plurality of teeth to provide a flat-bladed shovel-like action when engaged. The teeth are held in an equally spaced array between the opposite sides of the device by a series of identical cooperating springs, and all of the teeth must be of identical width for the device to function as intended. As illustrated and disclosed, the distal ends of the teeth are squared off and chisel-pointed with the particular purpose of scraping ice from within the corrugated channels. Teeth can be added or removed to accommodate different corrugated floors, but in all cases, the tooth spacing is intended to remain uniform.
[0008]Shortcomings of the Murphy device render it unable to clean a large percentage of the corrugated floors for which it is intended to be used. One problem with the Murphy device is that equidistantly spaced teeth, a central feature of the disclosed device, cannot accommodate a floor with non-uniformly spaced corrugations, as occurs at a joint between floor segments or near a wall. Another problem is that the teeth are all of equal vertical depth and therefore the device cannot be used to simultaneously clean channels of varying depths or sections of corrugated flooring having a combination of channels and flat surfaces such as may exist adjacent to a wall of the container. An additional problem is that if the device is used to clean the debris of fungible goods and not just ice, the springs may tend to become caked with debris resulting in the misalignment of teeth at the bottom of the pusher blade. A further problem is that the squared-off distal ends of the teeth will not be capable of cleaning to the bottom of the channels (or of cleaning both the bottoms and the sides of the channels) of most modern corrugated flooring which typically have channels that narrow or taper inwardly towards the respective bottoms.
[0009]While the device just described is the only known implement for clearing corrugated trailer and container floors, a number of tools having similar configurations have been used in the agricultural field. U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,801 [Popivalo] describes a hand implement having a number of equidistantly spaced teeth extending downward and outward from a handle and oppositely extending blade useful for a number of earth-working tasks. The primary tasks described are cultivating the earth by utilizing either the blade or the teeth to extend a uniform depth beneath the surface to either extract the weed or to cut the weed off from its roots below the surface. For either task, neither the blade nor any of the teeth are adjustable.
