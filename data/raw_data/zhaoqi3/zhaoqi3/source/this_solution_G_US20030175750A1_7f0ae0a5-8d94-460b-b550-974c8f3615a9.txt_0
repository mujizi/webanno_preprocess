Array Preparation and Use in Hybridization Reactions
[0334] When compared to monolayer coverage of a support, a polymer coating on a glass microscope slide offers increased coupling capacity of the capture probes. Toward this end, a support was prepared with a layer of neutral polymer up to 20 microns thick. The polymer was an acrylamide based material doped with glycerol monomethacrylate. When oxidized, the vicinol diols of the glycerol monomethacrylate were converted to aldehydes which served as anchor points for the amine-terminated oligonucleotide capture probes.
[0335] To anchor the polymer to the surface, the glass is first silanized with 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate according to the procedure of S. Savard, et al., "Hydrolysis and Condensation of Silanes in Aqueous Solutions," Polym Compos 5:242-249 (1984), which is hereby incorporated by reference. A dilute aqueous HCl solution, pH 2-4, of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (0.04 M) is vigorously stirred at 25.degree. C. for 30 minutes. Clean 3.times.1" microscope slides (prepared according to Example 8) are incubated with occasional agitation in this solution for 30 minutes at 25.degree. C., rinsed in deionized water, blown dry with nitrogen, and used within 24 hours.
[0336] One and one-thousandth inch stainless steel shims are positioned on three sides between the methacrylate treated slide and a second microscope slide which has been rendered hydrophobic (10% v/v dichlorodimethylsilane in toluene). E. N. Timofeev, et al., "Regioselective Immobilization of Short Oligonucleotides to Acrylic Copolymer Gels," Nucleic Acids Res. 24:3142-3148 (1996), which is hereby incorporated by reference. The three edges supported by the shims are held in place with clamps leaving a one 1 inch edge of the microscope slide open. The cavity thus formed is filled with a polymerizable solution containing N,N-dimethylacrylamide (0.9 M), glycerol monomethacrylate (0.1 M) (Polysciences, Inc. Warrington, Pa.), N,N-methylene-bisacrylamide crosslinker (0.0027 M), with N,N,N',N', tetramethylethylenediamine (0.2% v/v) and freshly prepared 10% ammonium persulfate (2% v/v) to initiate polymerization. The polymerization proceed for 30 min at 25.degree. C., and the "sandwich" is disassembled. The polymeric film is rinsed in deionized water, allowed to dry, and stored at 4.degree. C. until further use.
[0337] As practiced in the aforementioned reference, a conventional protocol is used, employing oxidation with NaIO.sub.4 to generate an aldehyde in its gel form, a custom designed precursor copolymerized with N,N-dimethylacrylamide. The aldehyde in the present invention is generated by treatment of the vicinol diol of glycerol monomethacrylate with NaIO.sub.4 (0.1 M, 25.degree. C., 1 hour). The aldehyde containing matrix is soaked in deionized water (1 hour, 25.degree. C.). The slides are removed from the bath, and excess water is blown off the hydrated surface with a stream of nitrogen. The polymer is allowed to dry (30 minutes, 25.degree. C.). Using a 0.5 .mu.l capacity syringe, 0.1 .mu.l of a fluorescently labeled 24-mer capture oligonucleotide probe (500 .mu.M in 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer at pH .about.5) containing a primary, terminal amine is deposited onto the aldehydic surface. One-tenth microliter of sodium cyanoborohydride (0.1 M) is deposited directly on top of the liquid containing the address. The reductive amination is allowed to proceed for 24 hours in a humidity chamber (25.degree. C.). After the coupling reaction, the matrix is soaked in bicine buffer (300 mM, pH 8), containing 300 mM NaCl and 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate for 30 min at 65.degree. C. The slides are rinsed in deionized water, blown dry with nitrogen and stored in a desiccator.
