[0012] In light of the foregoing background, the apparatus, systems, and methods herein may provide an improved gaze tracking method and system for various applications.
[0013] In an exemplary embodiment, a method involves the use of a "scene camera" that is affixed to eyewear or headwear looking outwardly relative to the individual wearing the eyewear or headwear. The scene camera transmits images to a processor programmed to identify multiple reference locations within scene camera images. Optionally, the processor may be coupled to, may communicate with, or may otherwise access a database of "templates," (i.e., images of known objects, configurations of reference locations, and the like) to identify reference locations.
[0014] In accordance with one embodiment, systems and methods are provided that identify reference locations using image recognition techniques to identify objects or components of objects with known geometries and colors. A common configuration using this method is to identify the four corners of a computer display monitor or mobile computing/phone device or other electronic object. This may be performed by recognizing the edge of the device frame relative to a background scene, the edge of the display screen (i.e., the backlit region in the case of a LCD-based device or object) relative to the frame of the display, or both. Corners and/or edges may be identified based on color, texture, sharp versus rounded geometry, size relative to other identifiable components, markings, and the like.
[0015] In accordance with another embodiment, systems and methods are provided that produce reference locations in which identifiable objects or surfaces have been added to a scene at known locations. For example, systems and methods may use pieces of paper or plastic conveniently affixed to objects (e.g., using adhesive, screws, clips, or other fasteners, and the like) that may be identified based on color and/or shape. Similarly, ink, paint or other pigmented substances may be applied to objects to generate reference locations with an identifiable color or shape. The color and/or shape of the applied reference surface may be based on measuring reflected, fluorescent, phosphorescent, or luminescent light that may be either visible or invisible.
[0016] In accordance with yet another embodiment, systems and methods are provided that produce bright reference points using reflective patches (e.g., constructed from paint, cloth, plastic, paper, and the like) that may be affixed to any surface (e.g., using adhesive, fasteners, and the like). These reflective surfaces may be based on prismatic or flat reflective mirrored surfaces. They may be illuminated using one or more light sources located on the eyewear or headwear, by ambient light, and/or other light sources. One example of a light source is a single or multiple light-emitting diodes (LEDs) located adjacent to or away from the scene camera on the eyewear or headwear. The light sources may use wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that are visible or invisible, e.g., infrared or other light outside the visible spectrum to avoid interference with normal activities of the wearer and/or others. In this configuration, the timing of illumination may be controlled by the eyewear or headwear and no illumination sources powered external to the eyewear or headwear may be required.
