FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of an enhanced recovery 2-stage single pass membrane process for the economical purification of large volumes of water containing low to moderate TDS and moderate to high hardness where a relatively high water purity is required with a minimum discharge of rejects. In essence, this process is similar to the process depicted in FIG. 1 except for partial recycling of the purified second stage membrane permeate back to the influent side of the first stage membrane via stream 25, thus enabling further purification using the 2-stage single pass membrane system and reducing costs.
FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of yet another enhanced recovery 2-stage double pass membrane process for the economical purification of moderate to large volumes of water containing low to moderately low TDS and moderate to high hardness where very high treated water purity is required (i.e. water electrical receptivity >2 meager Ohms) with a minimum discharge of rejects. In essence, this process is similar to the process depicted in FIG. 2 except for the addition of a second pass membrane system 27 to treat the permeate from the two-stage membrane system. The low-TDS and very low hardness 2nd pass membrane concentrate stream 28 back to the influent side of the first membrane stage, thus providing only a very small overall process reject stream 13 and a very high purity product stream 29 which can be used in the pharmaceutical industry.
FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of yet another enhanced recovery 2-stage double pass membrane process for the economical purification of moderate to large volumes of water containing low to moderate TDS and moderate to high hardness where an extremely high water purity is required (i.e. water electrical resistivity >18 mega ohms) with a minimum discharge of rejects. In essence, this process is similar to the process depicted in FIG. 3 except for the addition of a "mixed bed" ion exchange polishing resin 30 which will remove trace ions from the purified membrane permeate 29, thus providing an extremely high purity water which can be used in the electronics' industry while producing only a very small reject stream 13.
FIG. 5 is a schematic representation of yet another enhanced recovery 2-stage membrane process for the economical purification of moderate to large volumes of water where sparingly soluble compounds are removed from the second membrane stage concentrate 12 by means of chemical precipitation step 19 followed by gravity settling or clarification step 21 with or without the addition of chemical coagulants and/or flocculants. After separation of bulk suspended solids, fine solids in the water are separated by a polishing filter such as a multi-media filter, microfilter or ultrafilter 23, followed by recycling and splitting of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate stream 18 between the first and second membrane purification stages, as described in FIG. 1.
FIG. 6 is a schematic representation of yet another enhanced recovery 2-stage membrane process for the economical purification of moderate to large volumes of water where sparingly soluble compounds are removed from the second membrane stage concentrate 12 by means of chemical precipitation and filtration, followed by recycling, as in FIG. 5, except in this case it is required to obtain a relatively high purity of treated water, stream 16. This is achieved in accordance with this embodiment of the invention by recycling a substantial fraction (i.e. 10%-100% and preferably 90%-100%) of the second stage membrane permeate 25 back to the front end of the first stage and blending it with pretreated influent 3 and "softened" second stage concentrate recycle 9.
