[0012]Due to the half-duplex nature of the communication, which is mandatory in NFC, the initiator is not allowed to send other request messages to the target during the waiting time span, and only waits for the response message from the target. Therefore, NFC peer-to-peer communication is rather slow.
[0013]Prior art communication methods do not provide a solution that can be adapted in the present context. EP 1 009 180 A2 describes a method for managing the limited transmission capacity of a multiplexed bidirectional satellite link, i.e., a satellite channel that at the same time provides a multitude of individual communication links between a larger number of mobile stations and one base transceiver station. The transmission capacity of the satellite link is managed in order to mitigate traffic overload situations. A signaling protocol is described, which allows a transmission of user data by a mobile station only after a request for permission, which is to be granted by the base transceiver station. A mobile station repeats the request for permission if it does not receive permission within a waiting time span after the last transmission of the request. The waiting time span is mandatory for all mobile stations. In times of a high traffic load of user data over the satellite link, the usage of the satellite link for mere signaling, i.e., transmitting requests for permission, is reduced by means of communicating a larger value of the waiting time span to the mobile stations.
[0014]The method of EP 1 009 180 A2 is custom-tailored to the characteristics of a multiplexed communication link concurrently used by many devices. Application of this method to NFC communication would result in adverse effects. Instead of accelerating the half-duplex peer-to-peer NFC communication, an additional signaling protocol feature comprising the exchange of a request for permission to transmit user data and a response granting permission between NFC initiator and NFC target would introduce an extra communication delay.
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
