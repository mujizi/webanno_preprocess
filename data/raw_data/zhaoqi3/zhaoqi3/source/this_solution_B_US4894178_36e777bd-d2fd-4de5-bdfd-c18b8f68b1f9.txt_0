In the preferred regeneration technique, the H.sub.2 S-rich solution is sent to the regenerator wherein the absorbed components are stripped by the steam which is generated by reboiling the solution. Pressure in the flash drum and stripper is usually 1 to about 50 psia, preferably 15 to about 30 psia, and the temperature is typically in the range from about 50.degree. to 170.degree. C., preferably about 80.degree. to 120.degree. C. Stripper and flash temperatures will, of course, depend on stripper pressure; thus at about 15 to 30 psia stripper pressure, the temperature will be about 80.degree. to about 120.degree. C. during desorption. Heating of the solution to be regenerated may very suitably be effected by means of indirect heating with low-pressure steam. It is also possible, however, to use direct injection steam.
In one embodiment for practicing the entire process herein, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the gas mixture to be purified is introduced through line 1 into the lower portion of a gas-liquid countercurrent contacting column 2, said contacting column having a lower section 3 and an upper section 4. The upper and lower sections may be segregated by one or a plurality of packed beds as desired. The absorbent solution as described above is introduced into the upper portion of the column through a pipe 5. The solution flowing to the bottom of the column encounters the gas flowing countercurrently and dissolves the H.sub.2 S preferentially. The gas freed from most of the H.sub.2 S exits through a pipe 6 for final use. The solution, containing mainly H.sub.2 S and some CO.sub.2, flows toward the bottom portion of the column, from which it is discharged through pipe 7. The solution is then pumped via optional pump 8 through an optional heat exchanger and cooler 9 disposed in pipe 7, which allows the hot solution from the regenerator 12 to exchange heat with the cooler solution from the absorber column 2 for energy conservation. The solution is entered via pipe 7 to a flash drum 10 equipped with a line (not shown) which vents to line 13 and then introduced by pipe 11, into the upper portion of the regenerator 12, which is equipped with several plates and effects the desorption of the H.sub.2 S and CO.sub.2 gases carried along in the solution. This acid gas mixture is passed through a pipe 13 into a condenser 14 wherein cooling and condensation of water and amine solution from the gas occur. The gas then enters into a separator 15 where further condensation is effected. The condensed solution is returned through pipe 16 to the upper portion of the regenerator 12. The gas remaining from the condensation, which contains H.sub.2 S and some CO.sub.2, is removed through pipe 17 for final disposal (e.g., to a vent or incinerator or an apparatus which converts the H.sub.2 S to sulfur, such as a Claus unit or a Stretford conversion unit (not shown)).
The solution is liberated from most of the gas which it contains while flowing downward through the regenerator 12 and exits through pipe 18 at the bottom of the regenerator for transfer to a reboiler 19. Reboiler 19, equipped with an external source of heat (e.g. steam injected through pipe 20), vaporizes a portion of this solution (mainly water) to drive further H.sub.2 S therefrom. The H.sub.2 S and steam driven off are returned via pipe 21 to the lower section of the regenerator 12 and exited through pipe 13 for entry into the condensation stages of gas treatment. The solution remaining in the reboiler 19 is drawn through pipe 22, cooled in heat exchanger 9, and introduced via the action of pump 23 (optional if pressure is sufficiently high) through pipe 5 into the absorber column 2.
The amino compounds herein are found to be superior to those used in the past in terms of both selectivity and capacity for maintaining selectivity over a broad loading range. Typically, a gaseous stream to be treated having a 1:10 mole ratio of H.sub.2 S:CO.sub.2 from an apparatus for thermal conversion of heavy residual oil, or a Lurgi coal gas having a mole ratio of H.sub.2 S:CO.sub.2 of less than 1:10 will yield an acid gas having a mole ratio of H.sub.2 S:CO.sub.2 of about 1:1 after treatment by the process of the present invention. The process herein may be used in conjunction with another H.sub.2 S selective removal process; however, it is preferred to carry out the process of this invention by itself, since the amino compounds are extremely effective by themselves in preferential absorption of H.sub.2 S.
The invention is illustrated further by the following examples, which, however, are not to be taken as limiting in any respect. All parts and percentages, unless expressly stated to be otherwise, are by weight.
