[0301] A very powerful approach to fillet is to remove the triangles 3008 in a neighbourhood on and around the edge 3006 and fit a parametric surface to the neighbourhood of the hole created by the removed triangles. The surface should preferably be a smooth surface such as a 2nd, 3rd or lower order surface, a NURBS surface or another type of spline surface. New vertices are then sampled on the fitted surface and connected by triangles. What triangles to remove may be determined by removing all triangles parts of triangles and/or vertices in a certain distance from the edge or by directly selecting the proper neighbourhood 3003, e.g. limited by two curves 3007, one on each side of the edge, see FIG. 30. The curves can be manually adjusted by a number of visual control points.
[0302] When the triangles have been removed the fillet usually turns into a loft operation, where the boundary of two surfaces need to be connected. Note that the loft operation in general can be applied to connect two surfaces. The first step in the illustrated loft operation is to determine correspondence between the vertices 2301 at the two boundaries 2302, 2303, see FIG. 23. The correspondence may be determined by an exhaustive search for the correspondence that yields the lowest average distance between the corresponding vertices under the constraint that the order of the vertices is preserved.
[0303] The illustrated loft is based on a cubic B-spline surface, which requires a number of control points to be specified. For each vertex is calculated the vector, v.sub.c, which is perpendicular to the vertex normal and the boundary orientation vector in the vertex. The vertex normal is calculated as the area weighted average of the triangle normals of the triangles connected to the vertex. For each vertex in the set of corresponding vertices two control points are created as the vertex .+-.v.sub.c. An additional control point is then created as v.sub.c1 and v.sub.c2 added to the midpoint between the corresponding vertices p.sub.1 and p.sub.2. Beside the created control points the two vertices also act as control points. When this process has been repeated for all sets of corresponding vertices, the surface is fully defined by the controls points. New vertices are then sampled on the surface, i.e. by sampling the vertices on the spline, which connect the corresponding vertices. Given these vertices and the ordering of the corresponding vertex sets, the neighbour relationships between the sampled vertices are known. Knowing these relationships makes. K straightforward to connect the neighbouring vertices by triangles. The result of a loft is shown in FIG. 24 and FIG. 30.
[0304] When the fillet/loft has been applied to the model it is not ensured that the reference ear model is not penetrated by the connecting surface 2401, see FIG. 24. This penetration 2402 can however be minimised by moving the control points behind the surface of the reference ear. FIG. 25 shows the reduced penetration 2501 obtained by moving the additional control point between the corresponding vertices backward along v.sub.c1 and v.sub.c2 until it is behind the surface of the reference ear.
[0305] A number of alternative approaches exist for a fillet operation. The simplest approach to fillet is to apply the smoothing on the edge and its neighbourhood. Refer to section 1.4.12 for details on smoothing.
