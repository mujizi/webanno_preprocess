This invention relates to an oven for treating web stock, especially cloth stock in a tentor frame, and more particularly to such having special gaseous recycling.
In the typical treatment of textile fabric during manufacture thereof, a generally continuous web of fabric is ultimately passed through a tentor frame for stretching and drying of the textile held by tentor hooks or the equivalent along the edges of the web. Heated gases are forced over and through the stretched fabric in substantial volumes for drying. During this process, the temperature of the gases must be limited to a predetermined maximum to avoid damage to the fabric due to overheating during drying or during the post-drying heat treatment. Consequently, it is typically necessary to have several tentor frame dryer sections in series to achieve effective drying and post-drying heat treatment. Such equipment requires substantial capital outlay, space, and heat input. A great share of this generated heat is exhausted to the atmosphere and lost in the volumes of gases discharged. These gases are laden with varying amounts of liquids removed from the fabric during drying. When processing double knit fabrics, such liquids typically include oily compounds deposited on the fabric during the previous knitting operation, solvents, and carriers for the dyes. These are carried by the drying gases, in minute form and often partially combusted, into the atmosphere as smoke and fine mist. This of course is not ecologically desirable. Furthermore, some of the oily substance has a tendency to condense and coat the equipment interior and cause potential problems and fabric damage.
In sum, it is recognized in the trade that present tentor dryer equipment, though effective, is expensive and space consuming to the fabric mills. Not only the fabric mills, but also the public in general is encumbered with higher fuel costs and fabric costs due to the tremendous quantities of fuel necessary for the tentor dryers. And the public also has the ecological disadvantage of undesirable stack discharges. Though such discharges are questionable as to meeting governmental guidelines, the mills have not heretofore had available to them tentor dryers that are effective in this regard.
The present invention effectuates more efficient and rapid drying and heat treatment of web stock, particularly textile fabric, in a tentor, using less fuel and less equipment, and resulting in ecologically improved, controlled stack discharge. Using the invention, moisture and oil compounds are removed from textile fabric such as knitted polyester materials in a fashion significantly reducing fuel consumption and curbing pollution-causing stack discharge. With the special flow circuit and apparatus of the invention, the combustible volatile oil, solvent, and carrier type materials removed from the textile material during evaporation of the moisture are combusted in a special chamber, at a relatively higher temperature, the resulting gases being subsequently cooled with supplemental fresh air, with part of the gaseous stream then being returned to the oven for evaporation of moisture and oil products from additional web stock, and for preheating and/or post heating of the stock.
