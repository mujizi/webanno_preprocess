[0021] Another object of the present invention is that the said holes in the plate are fewer in number and are concentrated in the front section of the plate in the shape of an arrow head, and that they have the special feature that they open into certain grooves that extend to the rear section of the plate in the form of channelling grooves. With this solution, humidification of the garment is achieved by the front part of the plate, and drying is achieved as it passes down the rest of the plate so that ironing of superior quality is obtained.
[0022] In the light of the above a first object of the present invention is for the existing relationship between the widths of the vaporisation chamber and the plate to be of the order of three quarters, and because the geometry of the said vaporisation chamber is such that its sides are parallel to those of the said plate. This configuration proposed here assumes a considerable and significant increase in the capacity of the vaporisation chamber. At the same time, the greater absolute width of the vaporisation chamber allows the mesh that closes the rear of the vaporisation chamber to be larger. Finally, the lime accumulation capacity is considerably increased so that the useful life of the product is prolonged.
[0023] Another feature being claimed by this subsidiary patent is that the said front opening of the vaporiser comprises a vertical tube whose other open end penetrates an expansion chamber provided in the plate, and which is closed underneath by a sheet that is preferably made of stainless steel and which covers the lower surface of the plate as the element in contact with the garment being ironed. This solution has been demonstrated to be more convenient since the plate is less prone to be subject to possible blockage by lime accumulation.
[0024] A possible variant to the above consists in that the said front opening of the vaporiser has a vertical duct that is sealed at its other end, and has lateral openings that communicate with an expansion chamber situated in the plate and is sealed underneath by a sheet which is preferably made of stainless steel, and covers the lower surface of the plate as the element of contact with the garment being ironed.
[0025] Another object of the present subsidiary patent is that the interior of the vaporisation chamber contains at least one partition that extends over its entire height, and is attached to one of the side walls thereof but without reaching the opposite side wall. As will be shown below, a preferred embodiment contains two such partitions. This solution attempts to prevent the passage of the generated steam towards the plate from being too direct, so that it ensures that the steam emerging will not drag with it still liquid water which is present with the steam at a specific stage of the vaporisation procedure, until the pre-set temperature, at which all the water in the vaporisation chamber has been vaporised, has been reached.
