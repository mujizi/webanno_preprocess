[0057] The products of coal regeneration are described by Path 2, within FIG. 2. Coal can be introduced, in pulverized form, at (1), as conveyed in a media of CO.sub.2 that is recycled from the regeneration stream. The coal particles can enter the RRCLR, and as described by the mechanism in FIG. 1, undergo devolatilization, pyrolysis, generating primarily CO and H.sub.2. The CO and H.sub.2 can migrate to the surface, regenerate the absorbant material, liberating oxygen for reaction and production of an almost exclusive CO.sub.2 stream. These products of reaction, possibly at a temperature of up to 600.degree. C. depending on the oxidizing material in the reactor, can exit the RCLR at point (2). This location will generally coincide with the extraction point where a fraction of this predominantly-CO.sub.2 effluent is recycled to point (3), providing the media to transport, preheat, and inject coal particles. The CO.sub.2 product stream, laden with inorganic or ash material, SO.sub.2, NOx, and other trace species, is transferred through additional flue gas ductwork retrofit for this embodiment. Depending on the temperature of this product gas, an optional heat exchanger (5) can be employed for feedwater heating, or some other means to contribute to boiler thermal efficiency.
[0058] The product gas can enter the environmental control system of the host unit, which typically include either an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) of fabric filter for particulate matter (PM) removal (6), flue gas desulfurization (FGD) for SO.sub.2 control (7), and optionally a selective catalytic reduction (SCR)NOx control system (not shown). This product gas stream can feature a significantly lower flow rate than the original "flue gas" flow for which these environmental controls were configured-perhaps 30-60% of the design flow value. As a consequence, the lower flow rate can improve the effectiveness of the PM device, as either a fabric filter or ESP can experience a more favorable air/cloth ratio or specific collecting area (SCA), respectively. Regarding the impact of this lower flow rate on FGD performance--the residence time in the absorber vessel is greater, but the significantly elevated concentration of SO.sub.2 may inhibit removal effectiveness. In summary, the significantly lower flow rate of product gas that is produced by the regeneration reactor can improve performance of the environmental control system in many aspects.
[0059] An additional aspect of this process is removal of moisture (8) and treatment or reuse of the water (9), and compression (10) to generate CO.sub.2 as a supercritical fluid for transport to the sequestration site.
[0060] The bulk of the applications proposed have relied upon fluid bed technology and fluidization processes to generate a carrier of oxygen and carbon from fuel. The most prominent method chosen is referred to as an "interconnected fluidized bed system", including three separate fluid bed reactors, for commercial application (see Lyngfelt, A., Leckner, B.; Mattison, T., A Fluidized Bed Combustion Process with Inherent CO.sub.2 Separation: Application of Chemical Looping Combustion, Fuel, 2004, 83, 1749.).
[0061] Some advantages of fluid bed processes including the utilization of such reactors and the associated solids handling are well established, particularly in the chemical industry. In addition, the last 25 years has witnessed the evolution of fluid bed combustion technology for power generation.
