a feedback means, coupled to the computer means, for accepting feedback data corresponding to the pupil position from the computer means; and
a support means, connected to the camera and feedback means, for fixing the relative physical positions of the camera and feedback means.
The processing performed by the computer means of the vision tracking system may further comprise the selection of a first pixel intensity threshold for the segmentation of the pixel data into first and second groups. This processing may also comprise the following steps:
grouping individual pixels from one of the first or second groups into a first set having at least one pixel blob (note: a blob is a region of connected pixels belonging to the same group); and
selecting from the first set one of the pixel blobs corresponding to the pupil image.
