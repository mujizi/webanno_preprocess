The elevational feedback of each end of the screed head is based upon the pair of laser transmitter detecting a rotating reference beam of laser light that defines a reference plane. This reference plane, emitted by a laser transmission, thus indicates a designated elevation. During a screeding operation, each of the receivers provides elevation feedback to drive the hydraulics controlling the elevation of each side of the screed head in order to maintain the elevational reference.
A problem may arise, however, if the reception of the elevational reference by one the receivers is blocked or interrupted by something of an appreciable height, such as, for example, a support column in a building, or is disrupted. When a blockage or interruption occurs, there is a need to maintain the relative elevation of the ends of the screed head until the elevational reference can be reacquired by both receivers. There is also a need to be able to pull the screed head along a straight path, while maintaining the chosen thickness of the layer and matching forms or existing surfaces during the screeding operation.
One approach to this problem is to set up two external laser transmitters at the same elevation on opposite sides of the screed head. In this way, if a column blocks one of the laser transmitters, the other external laser transmitter is likely to be illuminating the laser receivers at the ends of the screed head, thereby compensating for the interruption. Essentially, the prior art method is to eliminate all blind spots around the receivers. However, this prior art method adds an additional cost in providing and setting up the second external laser transmitter in order to eliminate the possibility of a column block situation.
Another approach to this problem is to use a gravity-based cross slope sensor, which detects the angular shifts of the screed head as the screed head tilts up and down. Additionally, the gravity-based cross slope sensor may be used as a reference for set up and control in a super flat, or plumb, floor application. Accordingly, when both sides of the screed head are within the appropriate dead band, the desired grade of the cross slope sensor is measured and stored in memory of the screed head's control system. When one laser receiver loses reception of the elevational reference, the cross slope sensor detects the height of the interrupted receiver side of the screed head relative to its uninterrupted receiver side. That is, the cross slope sensor provides a relative measurement of the interrupted laser receiver which, when coupled with the absolute measurement of the uninterrupted laser receiver, provides an estimate of the absolute position of the interrupted laser receive. The control system of the screed head uses the provided absolute and estimated absolute positions to control the elevation of ends of the screed head. However, several disadvantages exist in the cross slope sensor arrangement described above.
First, the gravity-based cross slope sensor is vulnerable to accelerations along its sensitive axis, resulting in miscalculations of the screed head's slope. In screeding operations, it is quite common for the operator to `side shift` the screed head around columns as he pulls the screed head back. Since the sensitive axis of the gravity-based cross slope sensor is parallel to the length of the screed head, this side shifting can cause noticeable acceleration along the sensitive axis of measurement, thus dramatically affecting the feedback of the cross slope sensor. Second, harmonics of the machine boom carrying the screed head, which do not cause significant enough elevation shifts to be seen in the laser receivers at both ends of the screed head, are detectable by gravity-base cross slope sensor since it measures acceleration and not machine movement. Third, in order to reduce the effects of noise and to compensate for some of the low frequency harmonics of the machine vibration, considerable low pass filtering of the cross slope sensor is required. The use of low pass filters on the output of the gravity-based cross slope sensor adds an inherent time lag to the system, which degrades the bandwidth performance of the blocked side. Finally, separate control gains for the cross slope sensor are used to compensate for the time lag. Additionally, changes in loop gain are required to accommodate angular and positional feedback.
