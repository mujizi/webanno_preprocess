[0110] In other embodiments, the orienting device 54 and openings 34 could be formed in different sections of casing. In that case, connections between these different casing sections would preferably be of the type which provide for accurate azimuthal alignment when the sections are connected to each other. For example, certain threaded connections (such as stub Acme, etc.) provide positive and repeatable shoulder-to-shoulder makeup. In this manner, the precise azimuthal and longitudinal relationship between the openings 34 and the orienting device 54 can be conveniently determined prior to installing the casing string 38, even though these elements are formed in different portions of the casing.
[0111] In other embodiments, the barrier 90 could be in forms other than a sleeve. For example, the barrier 90 could be in the form of a hollow plug in each of the openings 34, with the plugs extending into the interior of the casing string 38. To open the openings 34, the portions of the plugs in the interior of the casing string 38 can be broken off. Thus, it should be appreciated that any type of barrier may be used in keeping with the principles of this disclosure.
[0112] Referring additionally now to FIG. 12, another configuration of the system 30 and associated method is representatively illustrated. In this configuration, the openings 34 are both azimuthally and longitudinally spaced apart in the casing section 36. Thus, after drilling a first one of the lateral wellbores 74, operation of the indexing device 73 will function to both azimuthally and longitudinally displace the diverter device 76, so that the drilling assembly 78 is then properly aligned with the next successive opening 34. This process is repeated for each of the subsequent openings 34.
[0113] Note that, in FIG. 12, the openings 34 are already formed through the sidewall of the casing section 36. This could be the case, for example, if a barrier 90 was previously used to plug off the openings 34, and then (e.g., after the cementing operation) the barrier was dissolved, drilled out or otherwise removed prior to the drilling operation. However, it should be understood that the openings 34 may be provided in the casing section 36 by any means (including, for example, jet cutting through the casing section sidewall, drilling through the casing section sidewall, etc.) before, after or during the drilling operation in keeping with the principles of this disclosure.
[0114] Referring additionally now to FIGS. 13-19, various configurations of a system 100 and associated methods for stimulating formations and/or zones intersected by the lateral wellbores 74 are representatively and schematically illustrated. These systems and methods can take advantage of the characteristics and benefits of the system 30 and associated methods described above to enhance production and/or injection of fluid into or out of the lateral wellbores 74.
