[0057] In the scrub motion, the rotation direction of the drum is changed rapidly and the laundry may not be away from the inner circumferential surface of the drum for a great amount of time. Because of that, an effect of strong-scrubbing-like washing by maximized friction between the laundry and the drum may be achieved in the scrub motion. In the scrub motion the laundry moved to a part of the second quadrant via the third quadrant is dropped rapidly and is re-dropped after being moved again to a part of the first quadrant via the fourth quadrant. As a result, visually in the scrub motion, the lifted laundry is dropped along the inner circumferential surface of the drum repeatedly.
[0058] FIG. 3 (f) is a diagram of the filtration motion. In the filtration motion, the motor 140 rotates the drum 130 so that the laundry is not dropped from the inner circumferential surface of the drum, and washing water is sprayed into the drum. That is, in the filtration motion, the laundry is spread along and maintains close contact with the inner circumferential surface of the drum as washing water is sprayed into the drum. The water is discharged out of the tub through the through holes 131 of the drum by the centrifugal force. Since the filtration motion spreads out/widens a surface area of the laundry and enables the water to pass through the laundry, the wash water may be supplied to the laundry uniformly.
[0059] FIG. 3 (g) is a diagram of the squeeze motion. In the squeeze motion, the motor 140 rotates the drum 130 so that the laundry clings to/is not dropped from the inner circumferential surface of the drum using centrifugal force, and then the motor lowers the rotation speed of the drum 130 to temporarily separate the laundry from the inner circumferential surface of the drum. This process is repeated and the water is sprayed into the drum during the rotation of the drum. That is, the drum is continuously rotated at a speed that is high enough not to drop the laundry from the inner circumferential surface of the drum in the filtration motion. In contrast, in the squeeze motion, the rotation speed of the drum is changed to repeat the process of the laundry clinging to and separating from the inner circumferential surface of the drum 130.
[0060] Spraying wash water into the drum 130 in the filtration motion and the squeeze motion may be implemented by, for example, a circulation path and a pump. The pump may communicate with the lower surface of the tub 120, with an end of the circulation path connected with the pump such that wash water is sprayed from the tub into the drum via the other end of the circulation path.
[0061] In alternative embodiments, wash water may be sprayed into the drum via a supply path connected with an external water supply source located outside of the cabinet. That is, one end of the supply path is connected with the external supply source and the other end thereof is connected with the tub. If a nozzle is provided to spray wash water into the drum, the wash water may be sprayed into the drum in either one or both of the filtration and squeeze motions.
