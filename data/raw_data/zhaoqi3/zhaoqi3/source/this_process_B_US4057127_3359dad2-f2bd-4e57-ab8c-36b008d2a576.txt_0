An understanding of the operation of the above constructional arrangement of the above components is believed evident from the foregoing description, taken in conjunction with the description of the previous embodiments, however, to supplement such understanding reference is made to FIGS. 13 to 15, wherein there is depicted a sequence of operating positions for the components.
If the rear brake actuating cable 50 is appropriately displaced in the usual fashion by actuation of the handlebar control levers 56 associated therewith, the circular stop member 148 rises from movable control member 316 and correspondingly, of course, the core wire 62 of rear brake actuating cable 50 freely passes through passage 320 such as shown in FIG. 13. Accordingly, the rearward braking device 46 will be appropriately actuated independently of the forward braking device 44.
To operate the forward braking device 44, front handlebar actuating cable 58 is displaced upwardly in response to actuation of the control lever connected therewith. As a result, the movable control member 316 is correspondingly moved upwardly. As noted in FIG. 14, the stop member 148 which contacts movable control member 316 enables the rear brake actuating cable 50 to be similarly upwardly moved. In this process, the rear brake device 46 is applying pressure to the rearward wheel 38 by reason of the rear brake actuating cable 50 being displaced. The magnitude of displacement of rear brake actuating cable 50 and movable control member 316 are substantially identical. Conjointly with the foregoing movement, spring 330 is compressed by the noted upward movement of movable brake control member 316. However, during the actual compression of spring 330 forward brake actuating cable 48 is not displaced. Consequently, the forward braking device 44 will, at least initially, not apply a braking pressure to the front wheel 36. Displacement of front brake actuating cable 48, however, will occur upon further upward movement of movable control member 316 and front handlebar actuating cable 58, much as in the manner indicated in FIG. 15. Accordingly, rearward braking device 46 will be applied but at a lesser braking pressure since, a indicated earlier, the braking pressure of the brake devices is a function of displacement of the brake actuating cables. Of course, this resultant delay of the actuation of the forward braking device 44 after the actuation of rearward braking device 46 will enable the rearward braking device 46 to be applied earlier and since cable 48 is displaced less than cable 50 with greater braking pressure than forward braking device 44. Accordingly, such operation provides for safety in the brake actuation of two-wheeled vehicles having front and rear brakes.
In connection with FIGS. 16-19, there is illustrated still another embodiment of the present invention. Inasmuch as this particular embodiment of the safety brake device is similar to the first alternate embodiment, like parts thereof throughout the several views will be indicated by like reference characters with, however, the substitution of the prefix four for one.
As shown in FIG. 16, taken in connection with FIGS. 17-19, safety brake actuating device 400 includes housing 402 which encloses the movable control member 416. Suitable openings 415 in the housing 402 permit passage of core wires 62 of the cables 48, 50 and 58 therethrough. The housing 402 may include a casing 404 with a removable cover plate 406, indicated in dotted lines, which is suitably removably secured thereto. Housing 402 should be large enough to permit generally pivotal movement of control member 416, in a manner to be described presently. Housing 402 may be connected by suitable means to the bicycle 30 in any conventional fashion. It should be emphasized that housing 402 need not be secured to the bicycle 30. The movable control member 416 is constructed in a manner such that fastening member 152 which connects molded half sections 154 is positioned on center or generally between the core wires 62 of forward and rearward braking cables 48 and 50, respectively. The half sections 154 when joined together define a plurality of openings 420 which accommodate core wires 62 of cables 48, 50 and 58. The middle opening 420, however, in this embodiment is somewhat elongated for purposes made clear. A fastening member 156 connects forward brake actuating cable 48 to motion control member 416.
