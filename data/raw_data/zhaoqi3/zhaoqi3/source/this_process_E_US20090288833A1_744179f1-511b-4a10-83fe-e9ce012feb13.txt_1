[0087] Thus, the method associated with the system 30 may include varying the profile (i.e., hole size and/or shape) along the length of each lateral wellbore 74 to optimize the distribution of hydraulic fracture energy along the length of each lateral wellbore during a fracture stimulation treatment. The lateral wellbore size and shape along the length of each lateral wellbore may be purposely adjusted by varying the jetting time and/or jet nozzle configuration at different points along the length of the lateral wellbore either during the initial lateral wellbore construction process or subsequent to jetting the original lateral wellbore.
[0088] Using this method, friction pressure losses may be purposely managed along the length of each lateral wellbore 74 and/or fracture initiations 92, 120 may be intentionally created at specific locations within each lateral wellbore. Optimizing the distribution of hydraulic fracture energy and creating certain fracture initiations 92, 120 or breakdown points along the length of each lateral wellbore 74 will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the fracture stimulation treatments which target each lateral wellbore and maximize the stimulated reservoir volume of each targeted reservoir, thus promoting maximum recovery of hydrocarbons contained in the reservoirs.
[0089] After drilling the first lateral wellbore 74 and optionally adjusting the hole size and/or shape along the lateral length, the drilling assembly 78 is withdrawn from that lateral wellbore, the indexing device 73 is operated to align the diverter device 76 with another one of the openings 34, and then another lateral wellbore is drilled or jetted through that opening. This process is repeated until a desired number of lateral wellbores 74 have been drilled or jetted through the openings 34 of the valve device 66.
[0090] After the lateral wellbores 74 have been drilled or jetted, the diverter assembly 72 may be retrieved from the well, or it may be repositioned in the parent wellbore 44 in order to drill another set of lateral wellbores into another formation or zone. For this purpose, the casing string 38 may have multiple orienting devices 54 interconnected therein, or one or more orienting devices may be secured in the casing string at different locations using respective one or more anchoring devices, etc.
[0091] One additional benefit of using the valve device 66 to provide the openings 34 through the sidewall of the casing section 36 is that the valve device can be selectively opened and closed after the lateral wellbores 74 have been drilled. This may be useful to control stimulation and/or production operations when, for example, it may be desired to selectively permit or prevent access or fluid communication through all, or less than all, of the openings 34.
