[0008]In order to achieve the above objects, the present invention provides the following solutions.
[0009]A method of producing a ceramic structure of the present invention includes the steps of preparing striped sheets each having a structure in which two or more types of layers including at least one ceramic layer are stacked, and forming a biaxial stack having stacking axes in two directions by stacking a sheet group including the striped sheets in a direction different from the stacking direction of the two or more types of layers.
[0010]In this method of producing a ceramic structure, a biaxial stack having stacking axes in two directions, namely, in the stacking direction of two or more types layers of the striped sheets and the stacking direction of the sheet group including the striped sheets, is prepared, and a ceramic structure is produced using this biaxial stack. Accordingly, elements can be arranged utilizing the surfaces that are formed when the sheets are stacked along these stacking axes. Therefore, high integration of the elements can be easily realized, and the degree of freedom of the arrangement of the elements can be increased. Furthermore, since the dimensions of the elements can be controlled by changing the thickness of each sheet of the sheet group, miniaturization of the elements can be easily realized.
[0011]Herein, the term "element" means the following: For example, in a solid electrolyte fuel cell, the element is a unit cell having a structure in which a solid electrolyte layer is sandwiched between a fuel electrode and an air electrode. In an all-solid-state rechargeable battery, the element is a unit cell having a structure in which a solid electrolyte layer is sandwiched between a positive electrode and a negative electrode. In a piezoelectric element stack, the element is a unit cell having a structure in which a piezoelectric element is sandwiched between a pair of electrodes.
[0012]In the method of producing a ceramic structure of the present invention, in the step of preparing striped sheets, a uniaxial stack may be formed by stacking two or more types of homogeneous sheets including at least one ceramic homogeneous sheet, and the uniaxial stack may then be cut along the stacking direction of the homogeneous sheets to prepare the striped sheets. In this case, the striped sheets can be relatively easily prepared.
