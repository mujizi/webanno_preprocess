[0001] The present invention relates to a method for bonding a polymer surface to a conductive or semiconductive surface, to applications of this method and to structures obtained by implementing it.
[0002] The term "polymer surface" is understood to mean a surface formed from a polymer and corresponding to all or part of the surface of an object that may be either exclusively made from this polymer or formed from one or more other materials, at least one part of the surface of which consists of said polymer. In particular, the object may be an object that includes an electrically conductive or semiconductive region, the surface of which consists of a polymer.
[0003] The expression "conductive or semiconductive surface" is understood to mean a surface consisting of an electrically conductive or semiconductive material and corresponding completely or partly to the surface of an object that may be either exclusively formed from this conductive or semiconductive material or is formed from one or more other materials, at least one part of the surface of which consists of said conductive or semiconductive material.
