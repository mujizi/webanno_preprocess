[0162] It should be noted here that in this embodiment, when multiple persons exist as tracking targets, the zoom of the camera 100 is controlled to a wide-angle side so that the multiple persons are contained or control is performed using a frame difference method so that an area close to a change-detected area is tracked, for instance.
[0163] (Displaying of Recommendation Comment and Parameter)
[0164] Sufficient accuracy with a certain tracking method may not be obtained because, for instance, it is impossible to obtain certain illuminance due to an influence of the installation place of the camera 100. In view of this problem, in this embodiment, an image picked up by the camera 100 and distributed from the camera server 200 is referred to and a tracking method recommendation message is displayed in a comment column 1001 of the window 1000 in accordance with the average value of brightness of the picked-up image.
[0165] FIG. 21 is a flowchart of an operation process executed by the CPU of the setting client 300 in order to display the message.
[0166] In FIG. 21, in step S2101, the CPU of the setting client 300 calculates an average value of brightness of an image picked up by the camera 100 and distributed from the camera server 200. When the average value of the brightness of the picked-up image is more than a predetermined level, the process proceeds to step S2104 in which ordinary initial setting values are displayed in the input fields 1401 to 1404 of a setting window for a selected tracking method.
