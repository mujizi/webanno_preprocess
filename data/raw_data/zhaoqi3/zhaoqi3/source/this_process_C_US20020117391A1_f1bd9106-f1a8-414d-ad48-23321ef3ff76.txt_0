[0016] Both the method and apparatus described herein are optimized for a typical CO.sub.2 process plant that might produce approximately 250 tons of CO.sub.2 per day. Those skilled in the art will recognize, however, that it may be necessary to make certain changes in the preferred embodiments described herein in accordance with the production specifications for a particular CO.sub.2 process plant. Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a schematic diagram of a preferred method of purifying CO.sub.2 from a hydrocarbon mixture in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. At the wellhead 10, the natural gas includes water and a number of other impurities such that the natural gas undergoes inlet separation and filtration to remove entrained solids, followed by stripping. Amine stripping is generally the method of choice such that this process is summarized by the reference to amine treatment at reference numeral 12 in FIG. 1. The resulting natural gas is sent to market as at reference numeral 14 and the remaining hydrocarbon mixture is the inlet stream for the method of the present invention.
[0017] In the first step of the method of the present invention, the hydrocarbon mixture resulting from the stripping of natural gas is dehydrated as at step 16. Dehydration can be accomplished in several ways as known in the art such as by injecting methanol to eliminate hydration formation and freezing of the water to allow separation of water from the hydrocarbon mixture, by ethylene glycol dehydration tower, or by equivalent methods. Methanol injection is preferred for dehydration in the method of the present invention, and the methanol is preferably injected upstream of a heat exchanger (not shown in FIG. 1) to give better mixing with the hydrocarbon mixture and subsequent separation of liquid and vapor at approximately 15.degree. F. as at step 20. Separation step 20 is preferably accomplished at relatively high pressures of about 300-320 psia.
[0018] Liquid from separator 20, which includes water, heavier (long chain) hydrocarbons, and heavier (BTEX) hydrocarbons, is heated as at 22 to about 80.degree. F. and, while still at about 290 psia, undergoes a second separation step as at 24. In the preferred embodiment, this second separation step is accomplished by quiet separation in a three phase, high pressure tank separator, described in more detail below. Vapor from this second separation step 24 is flared as at step 26 or optionally recycled (for instance, to the inlet stream) and clean water is dumped as at 28. The remaining liquid, comprising mainly heavier chain and aromatic hydrocarbons, is then stabilized at step 30 by heating to a slightly higher temperature (about 90.degree. F.) and storing in a two-phase separation tank at a much lower pressure of approximately 20 psia. The vapors from this stabilization step 30 are once again flared as at 26 or optionally recycled and the resulting stabilized liquid, in the form of valuable BTEX fuel, is marketed as at step 32.
