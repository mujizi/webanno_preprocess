[0004] 2. Description of the Related Art
[0005] A method of acquiring information about a subject has been used to measure the concentration of a component contained in a body fluid such as blood, other body fluids in the subject or excised tissue, thereby to achieve accurate diagnosis, fast determination of treatment course, and improved healthcare. To measure the concentration of each component of a body fluid, the body fluid must be extracted from the subject by blood collection. The extraction of the fluid is painful. It damages the skin of the subject and introduces the possibility of biohazard contamination to the subject and the operator.
[0006] To solve this problem, a number of patents and journal articles describe non-invasive methods of acquiring information about analyte concentration in the tissue of human subjects. One of the methods is "photoacoustic spectroscopy". In the photoacoustic spectroscopy, the concentration of a specific substance, such as glucose or hemoglobin, contained in the blood of a subject is quantitatively determined from the acoustic waves that are generated when the subject's tissue is irradiated with short duration pulses of light of a predetermined wavelength. U.S. Pat. No. 5,348,002, WO9838904A1, WO0215776A1 describe methods for the non-invasive determination of substances in human tissue using photoacoustic measurements. The light may be visible light, infrared light, or intermediate infrared light.
[0007] In addition to hemoglobin and glucose, photoacoustic spectroscopy can be used to determine other analytes in human tissue such as cholesterol, natural fat, bilirubin, collagen, and the like. Diagnosis of cutaneous cancer or breast cancer based on the results of the photoacoustic spectroscopy has recently proven its clinical usefulness. The photoacoustic spectroscopy utilizes a suitable substance selected from these substances and light having a wavelength at the substance selected exhibits highest absorption. Further it is increasingly expected that a diagnosis method be invented, which provides a two-dimensional image representing the concentration distribution of these substance.
[0008] While photoacoustic spectroscopy is used to measure substance concentration in tissue, ultrasound imaging has been extensively used for determination of the presence of morphological features, such as cysts and lumps, in human organs. Combining the distribution of substances and the morphological features in human tissue leads to better diagnosis and improved healthcare as it provides better characterization of the tissue, more accurate diagnosis for malignancies, and better definition of regions of abnormal pathology to guide in surgical removal of these regions.
