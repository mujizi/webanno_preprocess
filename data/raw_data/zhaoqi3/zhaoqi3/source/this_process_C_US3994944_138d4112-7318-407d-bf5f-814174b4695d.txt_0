Alkyl tin trichlorides are important precursors for the preparation of stabilizers for polyvinyl chloride. The introduction of alkyl groups onto the tin atom can take place in different ways (cf. W. P. Neumann, Die organische Chemie des Zinns, Ferdinand Enke Verlag, Stuttgart, 1967, pages 16 - 35). Nevertheless, in most cases a mixture of higher alkylated tin chlorides is obtained. This is particularly true for the preparation of alkyl tin chlorides from tin tetrachloride and alkyl aluminum compounds. In this case, a mixture of trialkyl tin chloride and tetraalkyl tin is produced. The lower alkylation stages are then attainable by so-called comproportionation (loc. cit., pages 41 - 43). Alkyl tin trichloride is obtained, for example, by comproportionation of tetraalkyl tin with tin tetrachloride:
R.sub.4 Sn + 3SnCl.sub.4 .fwdarw. 4 RSnCl.sub.3.
The preparation of alkyl tin trihalides according to this process is, however, limited to a few alkyl groups (for example the vinyl group) and occurs only in a special solvent (POCl.sub.3 /P.sub.2 O.sub.5). The reason for this difficulty is that the step necessary for complete comproportionation,
R.sub.2 SnCl.sub.2 + SnCl.sub.4 .fwdarw. 2 RSnCl.sub.3,
can be realized only in exceptional cases. Nevertheless, methods have been developed according to which alkyl tin trichloride is formed in addition to dialkyl tin- or trialkyl tin chlorides (cf. German Pat. No. 1,161,893 or British Pat. No. 739,883).
