[0003] Sophisticated ceramics for use in fuel cell gas separators have been developed which are electrically conductive, but these suffer from a relatively high fragility, low thermal conductivity and high cost. Special metallic alloys have also been developed, but it has proved difficult to avoid the various materials of the fuel cell assembly and the interfaces between them degrading or changing substantially through the life of the fuel cell, particularily insofar as their electrical conductivity is concerned, because of the tendency of different materials to chemically interact at the high temperatures that are required for different operation of a solid oxide fuel cell. For example, most metallic gas separators contain substantial quantities of the element chromium, which is used to impart oxidation resistance to the metal as well as other properties.
[0004] It has been found that where chromium is present in more than minute quantities it may combine with oxygen or oxygen plus moisture to form highly volatile oxide or oxyhydroxide gases under conditions that are typical of those experienced in operating solid oxide fuel cells. These volatile gases are attracted to the cathode-electrolyte interface where they may react to form compounds that are deleterious to the efficiency of the fuel cell. If these chromium reactions are not eliminated or substantially inhibited, the performance of the fuel cell deteriorates with time to the point where the fuel cell is no longer effective.
[0005] Several of these metallic alloys and one proposal for alleviating this problem are described in our patent application WO96/28855, in which a chromium-containing gas separator is provided with an oxide surface layer that reacts with the chromium to form a spinel layer between the substrate and the oxide surface layer and thereby tie in the chromium. However, these specialist alloys remain expensive for substantial use in fuel cell assemblies and it would be preferable to have a lower cost alternative.
[0006] Special stainless steels have also been developed that are stable at high temperature in the atmospheres concerned, but they generally contain substantial amounts of chromium to provide the desired oxidation resistance, and special coatings or treatments are required to prevent the chromium-based gases escaping from a gas separator formed of these steels. Another approach to a heat resistant steel gas separator is described in our patent application WO 99/25890. However, all of these heat resistant steels are specialist materials and their cost will remain high unless substantial amounts can be produced. Furthermore, the thermal and electrical conductivities of heat resistant steels are low relative to many other metals and alloys, for example 22-24 W/m.K compared to 40-50 M/m.k for the Siemens-Plansee alloy described in WO96/28855. To compensate for this, the thickness of the steel gas separator has to be increased, increasing the mass and cost of a fuel cell stack.
[0007] In yet another proposal, disclosed in our patent application WO 00/76015, we have found that copper-based gas separators may be successfully utilised in solid oxide fuel cell assemblies without poisoning the anode. Such a gas separator member comprises a layer of copper or copper-based alloy having a layer of oxidation-resistant material on the cathode side.
