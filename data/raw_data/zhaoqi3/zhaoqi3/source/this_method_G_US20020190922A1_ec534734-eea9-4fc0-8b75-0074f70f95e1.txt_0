[0039] Using multiple SLMs with a time-distributed illumination system can also increase effective frame rate. If one SLM can generate N different frames per second, then M devices can generate M*N frames per second simultaneously. FIG. 4a illustrates a preferred embodiment using two SLMs, 130A and 130B. Each SLM is illuminated by a light beam (101A or 101B) through a TIR prism (140A or 140B). A high-speed shutter (450A or 450 B) modulates the on/off of each illumination. The reflected image beams are combined through a third TIR prism 140C, and then projected through a projection lens 160 to a screen at 180 (not shown). FIG. 4b shows how to use the two shutters to place the two different image frames, each from a different SLM, into the timing period of a single frame. SLM 130A displays content A1 for a time period of .DELTA.t. During the same period, SLM 130B displays content B1. Shutter 450A opens for the first half of this time period, and then closes for the second half period. This action therefore projects content A1 only for the first half of the time period. Shutter 450B closes for the first half of this time period, and then opens for the second half period. This action thus projects content B1 only for the second half of the time period. As a result, during a time period .DELTA.t, two frames of different contents are displayed. The frame rate is therefore doubled. The open/close frequency of the high-speed shutter should at least be M times the maximum frame rate of the SLM, when M SLMs are used in the system. When more than 2 SLMs are used, more TIR prisms can be added to the system of FIG. 4a for image combination.
[0040] FIG. 5 illustrates another preferred embodiment for the multi-panel technique that provides a simpler arrangement than that of FIG. 4a. Instead of TIR prisms, a polarizing beamsplitter 540 is used to combine the images from the two SLMs. The polarizing beamsplitter also separates one input light beam 101 into two beams (101A & 101B) illuminating the two SLMs respectively. Because of the effect of the polarizing beamsplitter, the beam 101A directed Bat SLM 130A is P polarized, and the beam 101B directed at SLM 130B is S polarized. After reflections by the SLMs, the image beam from SLM 130A must contain S-polarized images in order to be reflected by the polarizing beamsplitter surface toward the projection lens 160, as indicated by 101S. On the other hand, the image beam from SLM 130B must be P-polarized in order to pass the polarizing beam splitter surface, as indicated by 101P. As a result, the polarization axis of the beam directed at the SLM must be rotated by 90 degree after reflection. When the SLMs are micro-mirror displays, such as DMD or TMA devices, the polarization of the reflected beam will be the same as the input beam. In such cases, quarter wave retarder plates 520A and 520B should be used so that the polarization axes of the beams reflected from the SLM can be rotated 90 degree (P turned in to S and S into P). When the SLMs are based on liquid crystal displays, such as FLC SLMs, this polarization rotation can generally be handled by the SLMs. In such cases, the quarter wave retarders are not needed. Because of the polarization difference between the two image beams (101S and 101P), a polarization selector 550, which comprises a polarization rotator 550a and a linear polarizer 550b, can be used to select either beam to pass on to the projection lens 160. This is equivalent to the function of the two shutters in FIG. 4a setup. The situation wherein beam 101S passing through the polarization selector is equivalent to the situation of shutter 450A open and 450B close. The situation wherein beam 101P passing through is equivalent to the situation of shutter 450A close and 450B open.
[0041] In the previous paragraphs, Pattern Projection technique is described by examples of color illumination over different sub-panels in order to project images of many colors. Illuminations of the same color (e.g. white) but with scaled intensity can be applied to different sub-panels to create images of many gray levels. For example, referring to the setup of FIG. 2a, the light intensity of each of the four separate paths (201A, 201B, 201C and 201D) can be scaled as 8:4:2:1 by inserting aperture stops of proper openings into the four paths. As a result, the four sub-panels illuminated by the four paths also have the 8: 4: 2: 1 brightness scale, as illustrated in FIG. 6a. A composite pixel 6301 comprising four sub-pixels can therefore display a composite brightness of 16 gray levels (0-15) by the combination of the four sub-pixels, each of a different brightness. This method can be called "Scaled Illumination".
[0042] Besides scaling illumination intensity over different sub-panels, scaled illumination can also be applied to adjacent pixels on an SLM by a single light pattern. For example, as shown in FIG. 6b, each light spot 100 in an illumination pattern illuminates four adjacent sub-pixels at an off-set location such that the illumination intensity on each of the four adjacent pixels is scaled as 1:2:4:8, as the numbers in each pixel indicate. Similarly, a rectangular illumination spot (which can be created by cross-stacking two arrays of micro- cylindrical lens) can also do this, as illustrated in FIG. 6c. If a pixel has 6 sub-pixels, it can have 64 gray levels, as shown in FIG. 6d. If the illumination pattern contains light stripes, each stripe can cover three rows of pixels and create an illumination scale of 1:2:4, as shown in FIG. 6e.
[0043] By methods described in previous paragraphs, the projected color images still contains the "look" of color triad structure, because each sub-panel on the display panel are physically separated by one or a few pixel pitches. This can result in undesirable artifacts in color images. Applying a projection and path-combination optical system, similar to the one that projects the light pattern onto the display panel, can merge the physically separated sub-panels and put R, G and B sub-pixels into one single pixel, that is, eliminating the look of color triads. The basic concept is illustrated in FIG. 7a. Since the path separation optics and combination optics are similar, only one set of separation/combination optical system 780 is needed if the display panel is of reflective types. Lens 120 projects the light pattern 100, which is generated by illuminating a pattern plate 110, onto the SLM 130 and projection lens 160 projects the image from the SLM onto the screen (not shown). The path separation/combination optics separates the illumination beam into multiple paths 781 leading to the display panel and partitions the display panel into four sub-panels 700. The same optics re-combines the images reflected from the four sub-panels and merges them into one single panel with each pixel comprising the superposition of four pixels each coming from a different sub-panel 790. FIG. 7b illustrates one example of this method. The path separation optics used in FIG. 3a are used as both path separation and combination optics. Lens 120a and 120b projects the light pattern on the pattern plate 110 onto the SLM 130, in four separated paths defining four sub-panels. Lens 120b and 160 act as projection lens and projects the re-combined images at a distance 180. The lens combination can be based on condenser lens or based on Schlieren optics. If desired, more then two components can be used in the lens combination and those components can be spread among the components of the separation/combination optics if necessary. A TIR prism 740 separates the illumination beam from the image beam. FIG. 7c illustrates another apparatus example using the path separation optics used in FIG. 3c. This setup uses two sets of 3 dichroic reflectors (331 and 332) to separate the light beam into R, G and B three paths. Each dichroic reflector reflects only a selected band of light (R, G or B) and passes the rest. Projection lens 120 projects the light pattern onto the display panel. The two sets of 3 dichroic reflectors are arranged as illustrated so that every path has the same length. (This is preferred when regular projection lens is used. If Schlieren projection optics are applied such that projection beams are collimated beams, then 3 dichroic mirror will be enough.) By adjusting the angle of each dichroic reflector, the three paths can be slightly offset to define three sub-panels. The image beams reflected from the display panel are re-combined and projected by projection lens 160. The three sub-panels are merged into one.
