As previously mentioned, each of openings 465 intersect with outer peripheral edge 461, and the openings include a pair of opposed side edges 471, 473 extending generally in converging relation with respect to each other between outer and inner peripheral edges 461, 463 with an end edge 175 interconnected between the opposed side edges and spaced generally adjacent the inner peripheral edge. Thus, bridges 469 are defined on body 459 generally between end edge 475 of openings 465 and inner peripheral edge 463, and pole sections 467 are defined on the body generally between opposite ones of side edges 471, 473 or adjacent openings 465, respectively. A pair of opposed extensions or flanges 477, 479 are integrally provided on adjacent ones of pole sections 467 at least adjacent outer peripheral edge 461 and the flanges extend into openings 465 past opposed side edges 471, 473 thereof. While openings 465 are described herein as being generally V-shaped, it is contemplated that other openings having various other shapes may be employed in other laminations within the scope of the invention so as to meet at least some of the objects thereof.
A plurality of other pole sections 481 may be formed from generally the same ferromagnetic material as that of lamination body 459, and each of pole sections 481 is generally V-shaped so as to generally correspond to or fit within openings 465, as discussed in greater detail hereinafter. Pole sections 481 include a generally arcuate edge 483 formed so as to have generally the same radius of curvature as outer peripheral edge 461 on lamination body 459, and the arcuate edge interconnects between one of the ends a pair of opposite side edges 485, 487 on pole section 481, respectively. Opposite side edges 485, 487 extend generally convergently from arcuate edge 483, and the other of the ends of the opposite side edges are interconnected with free end edge 489 which is generally opposite arcuate edge 483. To complete the description of laminations 457 and pole sections 477, a plurality of amortisseur winding receiving apertures 491 are provided through the laminations and the pole sections.
With reference in general to FIGS. 29-32 and recapitulating at least in part with respect to the foregoing, there is illustrated a method of making, manufacturing or assembling rotor 453, and the rotor has a plurality of discrete polar regions or areas, such as generally defined by pole sections 467 for instance, with such polar regions or pole sections being spaced apart generally about a peripheral portion 493 of the rotor (FIGS. 29, 30 and 32). In this method, a plurality of other discrete polar regions or areas, such as defined by pole sections 481 for instance, are positioned or otherwise placed or located in preselected positions between adjacent ones of pole sections 467, and a plurality of sets of magnetic material elements, such as magnets 89, 91 for instance are disposed or otherwise arranged between pole sections 481 and the pole section 477 adjacent thereto, respectively (FIGS. 30 and 32). A hardenable nonmagnetic material 495 is solidified in place in rotor 453 between pole sections 467, 481 and magnets 89, 91 so as not only to effect magnetic polarity definition between pole sections 467 and pole sections 481 but also to retain pole sections 481 against displacement from the preselected positions thereof, respectively (FIG. 33). While hardenable non-magnetic material 495 as discussed above is disclosed as a resin material, it is contemplated that other hardenable non-magnetic materials, such as aluminum, copper or alloys thereof for instance, may be employed in the method of making rotor 453 within the scope of the invention so as to meet at least some of the objects thereof.
More particularly and with specific reference to FIGS. 29-32, a plurality of laminations 457 are stacked or otherwise assembled together generally in juxtaposed or face-to-face relations thereby to form lamination stack 455, as shown in FIG. 29, and such stacking of the laminations is illustrated by functional diagram box 497 in FIG. 31. Either during or subsequent to the above discussed stacking of laminations 457 into rotor stack 455, openings 465 and apertures 491 of each of the laminations are respectively aligned or otherwise arranged or located with respect to each other so that such aligned openings define a plurality of slots or slot openings 499 and so that such aligned apertures define a plurality of amortisseur winding receiving opening or bores 501 which extend across or through rotor stack 455 between a pair of opposite ends or end faces 503, 505 thereof, respectively. Even though the alignment of openings 465 and apertures 491 so as to respectively form slots 499 and bores 501 may be accomplished during the stacking of laminations 457, as discussed above, such alignment is illustrated in a separate functional diagram box 507 in FIG. 31 for purposes of clarity. Further, albeit not shown for the sake of brevity, it is understood that suitable equipment may be employed to effect the stacking of laminations 457 and the alignment of openings 465 and apertures 491, as discussed above. Of course, it may also be noted that upon the alignment of openings 465 and apertures 491, outer and inner peripheral edges 461, 463 of laminations 457 in stack 455 thereof are also generally aligned or otherwise arranged with each other so that the outer peripheral edges define in part peripheral portion or wall 493 on rotor 453 between opposite ends 503, 505 therof and inner peripheral edges 463 generally define a shaft receiving bore 509 extending through the rotor between the opposite end thereof, respectively, as best seen in FIG. 29. The particular edges on laminations 457 which define openings 465 therethrough, as discussed above, are also disposed generally in alignment with each other upon the alignment of the openings so as to form slots 499 in rotor stack 455, and such particular edges in their aligned formation define walls or wall means of the slots; however, for the sake of brevity, such slot walls will be designated by the reference numerals of such particular edges corresponding thereto when referred to hereinafter.
Either before, after or simultaneously with the above discussed stacking of laminations 457 and the alignment of openings 465 so as to define rotor slots 499, a plurality of pole sections 481 may also be stacked or otherwise assembled together generally in juxtaposed or face-to-face relations thereby to form a plurality of stacks 511 thereof, as best seen in FIGS. 29 and 32, with the pole section stacks having generally the same stack lengths or heights as lamination stack 455. Of course, either during such stacking of pole sections 481 or subsequent thereto, the particular edges on the pole sections are respectively aligned with each other so as to define walls or wall means on the pole section stack 511; however, for the sake of brevity, such pole section walls will be designated by the reference numerals of such particular edges corresponding thereto when referred to hereinafter. When the particular edges of pole sections 481 are so aligned, apertures 491 extending therethrough are also aligned with each other so as to define other amortisseur winding receiving bores 501 through pole sections stacks 511. Since the stacking and aligning of pole sections 481 may occur before, after or simultaneously with the stacking of laminations 457, as previously mentioned, the pole section stacking and aligning are respectively illustrated by functional diagram boxes 513 and 515 in FIG. 31 in parallel flow relation with box 493 which illustrates the lamination stacking. Albeit not shown for the purpose of brevity, it is understood that suitable equipment may be employed to effect the stacking and alignment of pole sections 481 into stacks 511 thereof.
