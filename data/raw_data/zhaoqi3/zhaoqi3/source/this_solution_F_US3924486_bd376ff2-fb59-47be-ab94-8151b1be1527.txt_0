In mechanisms of this type the relative helical movement produced in operation between the screw and nut causes the balls to travel along at least one helical channel bounded by a nut thread and by the corresponding or registering portion of a screw thread, from the first end of this helical channel which is adjacent to one end face of said nut to its opposite end located near the other end face of the nut, means being provided for returning the balls from said opposite end of the helical channel to its first end, notably in the form of an auxiliary, so-called "ball re-circulation" channel.
Some of these known mechanisms for transforming movements comprise a nut provided with at least one peripheral ball re-circulation channel substantially parallel to the nut axis and interconnecting the two ends of a same thread of said nut which are located near the end faces thereof, respectively. This type of construction is attended by the advantage that the nut thread or threads are utilized substantially throughout their length for transmitting efforts between the screw and nut. The weak points of the transmission, which correspond to the points of transfer of the balls from the helical channel to the re-circulation channel, are very few. On the other hand, this construction is objectionable in that the outer diameter of the nut must be relatively great, and this may prove detrimental in certain applications.
To avoid these inconveniences of known embodiments of the screw and nut mechanisms, various types of ball recirculation channels lying not entirely within the nut but in the threaded portion thereof which co-act with the screw have already been proposed. It is obvious that this construction permits the outer diameter of the nut to be reduced considerably in comparison with the screw diameter. Moreover, this solution is advantageous in that the means usually provided on the end faces of the nut for interconnecting the ends of the helical channel and those of the re-circulation channel, which means constitute troublesome projections on said end faces, can be dispensed with. However, in most of these last-mentioned constructions each nut thread is not utilized throughout its length for transmitting efforts between the screw and nut, due to the axial space occupied by the re-circulation channel or channels and, therefore, the maximum effort transmissible to or from a nut of predetermined length is reduced.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The movement transforming mechanism according to this invention is of the first-mentioned, that is, with a nut comprising at least one peripheral ball re-circulation channel substantially parallel to the nut axis and interconnecting the two ends of a same thread of said nut which lie near one of its end faces. This arrangement is free of the inconveniences described hereinabove, characteristic of the two known types of mechanisms, while preserving substantially the sum of their advantages.
