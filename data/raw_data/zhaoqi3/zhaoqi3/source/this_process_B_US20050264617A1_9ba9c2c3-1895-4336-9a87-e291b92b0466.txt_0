[0222] Next, a description will be give, with reference to FIGS. 17A through 17G, of a manufacturing method of the electrostatic actuator. Each of FIGS. 17A through 17G is a cross-sectional view taken along a line parallel to the shorter side of the vibration plate. In FIGS. 17A through 17G, parts that are the same as the parts shown in FIGS. 12A through 12G are give the same reference numerals, and descriptions thereof will be omitted. However, it does not mean to be formed of the same material.
[0223] The process of FIGS. 17A through 17D are the same as the process of FIGS. 12A through 12D, and description thereof will be omitted.
[0224] FIG. 17E shows the result of the etching process of removing the sacrifice layer. By performing the etching for removing the sacrifice layer 14, the thickness of each of the insulating layers 13 and 15 in the air gap is varied simultaneously. This process utilizes the fact that the etching for removing the sacrifice layer 14 progresses from the vicinity of the sacrifice layer removing hole 60, and the plasma etching time at the opposite ends of the air gap 14a is longer than the plasma etching time at the center portion of the air gap 14a.
[0225] The difference between the processes of FIG. 17E and FIG. 12E is that a difference is given to a etching selection ratio between the sacrifice layer 14 to be etched and the insulating layers 13 and 15 that serve as etching stoppers. That is, in the example of FIG. 17E, means is taken so that the etching selection rate becomes smaller than that of the example shown in FIG. 12E. Here, the etching selection ratio is a numerical value expressed by "an etching rate of the material of the sacrifice layer/an etching rate of the material of the insulating layer".
[0226] As for means to change the etching selection rate, there are means to change kinds of the insulating layers 13 and 15 and/or the sacrifice layer 14, means to change the film deposition condition and/or film deposition method, means to change the etching conditions of removing the sacrifice layer 14. Although means to change the etching conditions for removing the sacrifice layer 14 is used in the present embodiment, there are various approaches also in this means. For example, a mixture ratio or an amount of flow (an amount of use) of etchant may be changed, or a power supply of plasma may be changed. Unlike the example of FIG. 12E, the etching for removing the sacrifice layer 14 is performed with the resist 70 remaining thereon in the example of FIG. 17E. This is because the reduction in the etching selection ratio between the sacrifice layer 14 and the insulating layers 13 and 15 influences the etching selection ratio between the insulating layer 17.
