[0044] This example illustrates the effect of additional components such as acids and reducing agents in addition to the color changing specie (leuco dye) and the differences of behavior between different blocking groups. The coating or resin system can be employed alone, or in combination with a handling process to improve the contrast or the rate of the color change.
Example 3
[0045] A 15 wt % solid polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), leuco methylene blue (LMB), 1-methoxy-2-propanol solution was made in a nitrogen atmosphere. Using this solution, the interior wall of a three-layer vial (polycarbonate-oxygen barrier layer-polycarbonate) was coated and then left upside-down to dry in a nitrogen atmosphere. After 12 hours of drying, the vial was partially filled with water that had been extensively degassed, capped using a clamp seal with Teflon septum, and removed from nitrogen atmosphere. The absorbance of the interior walls was measured using a Hewlett Packard UV-vis spectrophotometer to be 0.08 at 655 nm when the vial was removed from nitrogen atmosphere and exposed to ambient conditions. The absorbance at 655 nm was again measured after exposure to air for 2 hours, 25 hours, 75 hours, and 168 hours. During this time (0 to 168 hours) the absorbance at 655 nm increased to 0.70. The relatively small increase in absorbance indicates that some oxygen permeated into the coating on the inside of the bottle, converting some of the dye to its oxidized (absorbing) form. However, most of the dye remained in its colorless form. At 168 hours the 5 milliliters (ml) of degassed water was removed through the septum of the vial using a syringe and replaced with tap water to simulate the vial being tampered. Within several minutes after the "tamper" occurred, the absorbance of the vial increased to 0.84, corresponding to the rapid formation of methylene blue, the colored (absorbing) form of the dye. The absorbance at 655 nm of the internal walls of the coated vial continued to increase to 1.05 forty-four hours after being tampered.
Example 4
[0046] A resin formulation comprising polycarbonate resin (M.sub.W=17,700 amu), a phosphite heat stabilizer (Doverphos S-9228), and 0.1 parts per hundred (phr) color changing specie (t-Boc LMB), was compounded on a Sterling single screw extruder (O 44 mm). The following temperature settings were used (in .degree. C.): Feed/Z1/Z2/Z3/Die=250/260/270/270/270. Pellets, which had a blue/purplish appearance, were packaged off the line into Foodsaver bags (low oxygen permeability nylon bags) sealed under vacuum. The material was then molded into 5.08.times.7.62 centimeter (cm) chips (3.2 millimeters (mm) thickness) on a Boy 15S molding machine using the following temperature profile: Feed/Barrel/Nozzle (.degree. C.)=260.degree. C./280.degree. C./280.degree. C. The chips, which appeared slightly green/amber after molding, were packaged into individual sleeves and placed in a vacuum-sealed FoodSaver bag to protect them for light and/or oxygen exposure. Color and spectral data were collected on a MacBeth 7000A spectrophotometer in transmission mode.
