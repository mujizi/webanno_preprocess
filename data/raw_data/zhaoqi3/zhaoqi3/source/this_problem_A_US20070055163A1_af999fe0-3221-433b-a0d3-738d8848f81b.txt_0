[0101] The lengths l.sub.0, l.sub.1, and l.sub.2 may be different from person to person depending on the body height as well as the location of the sensor. However, it can be assumed that they are proportional to the body height. Given the patient's body height, they can be approximated to average lengths {overscore (l)}.sub.0, {overscore (l)}.sub.1, and {overscore (l)}.sub.2 proportional to the body height. When the patient is lying, the third term in the above equation, i.e. -l.sub.0, must be deleted.
[0102] The cosine terms in the above equation can be obtained directly from the accelerometer readings as described with reference to FIGS. 7(a)-7(c). Those accelerometers, consisting of a mass-spring system, indicate the acceleration of gravity 514, i.e. 9.8 m/s.sup.2, when directed to the vertical direction, as shown in FIG. 7(a). When the axis of the accelerometer 506a-b is kept horizontal, no acceleration is observed, as shown in FIG. 7(c). As the accelerometer axis 506a-b inclines, its output increases from 0 to 9.8 m/S.sup.2, with an intermediary position depicted in FIG. 7(b). In principle the accelerometer reading is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the gravity vector and the accelerometer axis. Therefore, dividing the accelerometer output by 9.8 m/s.sup.2 yields the cosine function value of the angles .theta..sub.1, and .theta..sub.2. Substitution of these cosine values into the above equation yields the height h.
[0103] This principle does not apply, when the arm is in motion. Before computing the height h, the height sensor must check if acceleration other than gravity is observed. To solve this problem, additional accelerometers or multi-axis accelerometers can be used instead of single axis accelerometers to sense arm motion in three dimensions. Another way to solve this problem is by using the accelerometers output signal along with time information. For example, the system may require a constant output from the accelerometers for a specified time period before the output is used to calculate the height. Thus, motion artifacts can be removed, better calibrating the accelerometer, and more accurately estimating the angles .theta..sub.1, and .theta..sub.2.
[0104] Also, time information and a temporal criterion can be used to ensure that the wearer is at rest for a certain amount of time before blood measurements are taken. Some blood pressure measurement regiments strive to track an individual's resting blood pressure. The time information and accelerometer output can be used to exclude measurements when the individual is not resting.
[0105] Other uses of the accelerometer data are also within the scope of the invention. For example, when the output signal from a single accelerometer indicates an acceleration of. 9.8 m/s.sup.2, then the system can infer that the user's hand and sensor are at his side and thus, a fixed distance below his heart. Similarly, if the acceleration signal is 0.0 m/s.sup.2, then the sensor is horizontal and the user's hand is approximately at the level of his heart. Addition of a time requirement (e.g., only make the preceding inference in the position persists for longer than 10 seconds) can help ensure that the preceding inferences are true, because, while it may be possible to briefly orient the hand horizontally but not have the entire arm horizontal, or hold the hand straight down without having the entire arm straight down, these unusual alternative positions are unlikely to be maintained for periods of more than a few seconds.
