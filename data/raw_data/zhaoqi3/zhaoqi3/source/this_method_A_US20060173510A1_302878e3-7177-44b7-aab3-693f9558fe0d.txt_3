[0151] In one embodiment, the electrode(s) 120 are connected to a power source (such as a battery or pulse generator) which provides the energy source for the electrical stimulation. The electrode(s) 120 may be mono-polar, or multi-polar. However, the use of a multi-polar electrode is preferred. Unipolar stimulation typically utilizes a pole and a reference electrode, and requires relatively high amounts of current. Bipolar stimulation utilizes adjacent poles with current flowing from the negative pole (cathode) to the positive pole (anode), and causes depolarization of nervous tissue at current levels lower than with unipolar stimulation. Whereas, multi-polar stimulation can have multiple anodes and cathodes, where one electrode could actually be an anode relative to another electrode and a cathode relative to a more positive electrode. Very complex electric fields can be established within the biological tissue with multi-polar electrode configurations, which may have benefits in desynchronizing epileptiform activity.
[0152] In one embodiment, the electrode 120 is controlled to produce an electronic current for the application of stimulation. Preferably, the current will comprise relatively high frequency pulses, and may possess a low frequency amplitude or frequency modulation. The exact parameters for the electrical stimulation of the electrodes are likely to vary by patient; however, based upon data known for stimulations performed on the brain, parameters suitable for use herein are: a frequency in the range of from about 0.1 Hz to about 2500 Hz, preferably in the range of from about 10 Hz to about 250 Hz, and a pulse width in the range of from about 10 microseconds to about 10 seconds, preferably in the range of from about 50 microseconds to about 250 microseconds, a voltage amplitude in the range of from about 500 mv to about 2K volts, preferably in the range of from about 30 volts to about 100 volts, and a current amplitude in the range of from about 0.01 mA to about 1 amp (A), preferably in the range of from about 5.0 mA to about 50 mA. Shorter pulse widths are preferred for safety considerations. In another embodiment, high frequency bursts of current are produced on top of an underlying low frequency continuous stimulus. Preferably, the electrode is associated with a programmable controller, which may be utilized to produce continuous, scheduled, or episodic, responsive stimulation. In another embodiment, the programmable controller is utilized to gradually increase stimulation to desired maximum levels. Alternatively, a programmable controller is utilized to immediately produce stimulation at the desired maximum level or to perform any number of intermediate steps to reach the maximum level.
[0153] In one embodiment of the present invention, bioelectric neuro device 100 is utilized for prevention of neurological events. This method involves the detection and analysis of brain's electrical activity to detect epileptiform activity or to detect such impending activity. If the epileptiform activity is present or is impending, responsive stimulation may be initiated. The results of the epileptiform activity analysis may also be used to modify the parameters of the non-responsive stimulation to improve the suppression of seizures or other undesirable neurological events. The responsive stimulation is initiated when an analysis of the EEG, or other signals, shows an impending or existent neurological event, such as epileptiform activity. When the seizure onset is detected and electrical stimulation is applied, the seizure is pre-empted. If all seizures are pre-empted, by definition, epilepsy is prevented.
[0154] In another embodiment, stimulation is applied at intermittent or preset periods to prevent epilepsy. Electrical stimulation may be applied on an as needed basis by the epilepsy sufferer to prevent epileptic activity. If the epilepsy sufferer feels an aura, he or she may want to turn the electrical stimulation on to pre-empt the seizure. The VNS system allows the patient to manually turn the stimulation on as needed. Lasting affects have been reported due to the use of electric stimulations for seizures, implying that using stimulation for brief periods may have prolonged benefit, such as using it prior to retiring to bed.
[0155] In another embodiment, the parameters (e.g., electrode(s) used, morphology of the stimulating signal, number of pulses or cycles of the stimulating signal, amplitude, pulse-to-pulse interval or frequency of the stimulating signal, duration of the stimulating signal, etc.) of the responsive stimulation are varied. The variation of the parameters may be based either upon a preprogrammed sequence or based upon some characteristic of the detected abnormal neural activity. Additionally, the parameters of the responsive stimulation are varied between different episodes of spontaneous abnormal neural activity to minimize the tendency of the stimulation itself to predispose the brain to epileptogenesis (also known as "kindling"). Analysis of the electrical activity of the brain can continue while stimulation is applied by analyzing electrodes that are not being stimulated to determine whether the stimulation has had its desired effect.
