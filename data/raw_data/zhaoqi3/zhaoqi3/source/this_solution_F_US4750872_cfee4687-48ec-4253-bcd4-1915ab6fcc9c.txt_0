These different configurations can anyway be chosen according to the installation of the pump in the household appliance.
Inside the sealed body defined by the pump body 202 and by the volute 203, and more in particular inside the cylindrical section 204, is contained a rotor 208 with permanent magnets 209 which is axially provided with a cylindrical through cavity 223, traversed by a fixed supporting and guiding pin 237, the first end thereof 238 being forced and blocked into a cylindrical seat 239 provided in the closed base 206 of the cylindrical section 204.
In this solution, therefore, the pin 237 is shown to be fixed and the rotor 208 is free to rotate, supported and guided by the pin itself.
It should suitably be noted that the rotor 208 may be advantageously obtained by injection of a plastic material into a mould, wherein the permanent magnets are positioned as inserts.
In order to allow low friction and an excellent centering of the rotor 208, the cylindrical through cavity 223 has, at its two ends 247 and 248, a diameter which is smaller than that which can be found in the intermediate area 249, so as to practically create only two sliding areas, indicated at 250.
