[0095] After the release, the web W is folded up in two by passing through between a pair of nip rolls 6 and 6 shown in FIG. 4. Then, the web W is carried downstream, and is cut along the cut-off line CL into individual diapers M, as shown in FIG. 1.
[0096] Note that in order to precisely maintain a constant positional relationship between the holding means 20 and the opposite side edges W1 and W2 of the web W of FIG. 3A, the holding means 20 may be aligned at a predetermined position by the displacement means 30 before holding the opposite side portions Wa and Wb.
[0097] Before the side portion Wa, Wb of the web W is held by the holding means 20, the opposite side portions of the outer sheet Wo of the web W may be cut off by a slitting operation by means of cutters 7 and 7, as shown in FIG. 5. By this process, the intervals (E1 and E2) between the opposite side edges of the outer sheet Wo and those of the inner sheet Wi become an equal value E. As a result, by folding so that the opposite side edges W1 and W2 of the web W are aligned with each other, the opposite side edges of the inner sheet Wi are also aligned with each other.
[0098] As shown in FIG. 5, the absorbent body C may be arranged on the inner sheet Wi after the outer sheet Wo and the inner sheet Wi are attached together, and an elastic member may be arranged around the leg hole Lh.
[0099] While the above description is directed to a case where the cam 5a, 5b is used to achieve a state transition of the holding means 20 between the open state and the closed state, the transition between the open state and the closed state may be done by means of a magnetic force, an actuator, etc.
