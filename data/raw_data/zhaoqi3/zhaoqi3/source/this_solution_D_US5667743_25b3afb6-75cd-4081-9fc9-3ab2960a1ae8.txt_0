Fiber and yam physical properties (modulus, tenacity and elongation) were measures according to the procedures of ASTM D885. The twist for fibers and yams was three per inch (1.2 per centimeter) regardless of defiler.
Toughness factor (TF) is the product of the tenacity, measured in units of grams per denier, and the square root of the elongation, and is a property used commonly in industrial aramid fiber evaluations.
Examination of the wet spun fiber cross-section during the different stages of the present process provide insight into fiber morphology. To provide cross sections of a dried fiber, fiber samples were micro-tomed, but since the fibers had not been subjected to drawing or washing special handling was required to ensure that the fiber structure was not unduly influenced during the fiber isolation steps. To preserve the fiber structure during the process of cross sectioning, coagulated or coagulated and conditioned fiber was removed from the process and placed into a solution of similar composition from which it was removed. After about 10 minutes, about one half of the volume of this solution was removed and replaced with an equal volume of water containing about 0.1% by weight of a surfactant. This process of replacing approximately one half of the volume of the solution in which the fiber samples were contained with the surfactized water was continued until nearly all of the original solution had been replaced with surfactized water. The fiber sample was then removed from the liquid and dried in a circulating air oven at about 110.degree. C. The dried fiber was then micro-tomed and examined under the miscroscope.
The following examples are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting.
