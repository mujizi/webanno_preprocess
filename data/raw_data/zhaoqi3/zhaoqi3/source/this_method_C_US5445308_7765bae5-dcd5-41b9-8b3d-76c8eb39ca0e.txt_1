Referring now to FIG. 11, the surfaces are electrically isolated by omitting the step (shown in FIG. 4) of bringing the surfaces 20 and 22 closer together. That is, surfaces 20 and 22 are still separated by length L1 when liquid epoxy 12 is hardened into solid epoxy 30. This prevents the filler regions 28 from contacting both surfaces. Thus, no continuous conductive bridges 32 between surfaces 20 and 22 are formed. While discontinuous regions 43 of gallium 14 fail to provide continuous electrical paths between the surfaces, regions 43 significantly increase the thermal conductivity between the surfaces.
Referring now to FIG. 12, the surfaces are electrically isolated by coating surface 20 with a thin insulating layer 44 such as 0.1 to 10 mils of nitride passivation or a diamond film. Insulating layer 44 is thin enough to electrically disconnect surface 20 from bridges 32 without substantially decreasing the thermal conductivity between surface 20 and bridges 32.
Referring now to FIG. 13, the thermally conductive connection is spread across the surfaces and randomly dispersed filler regions form anisotropic electrical connections between electrical pads on the bonded surfaces. Surface 20 comprises electrical bonding pads 46; surface 22 comprises electrical bonding pads 48. Pads 46 are in one-to-one correspondence with, and preferably are mirror representations of, pads 48. Upon vertically aligning chip 24 and substrate 26, pads 46 correspond in one-to-one relationship with pads 48 to form matching pairs of pads. That is, a single pad 46 lies directly above each pad 48 and vice versa. This method of attachment between electrical components is commonly referred to as "flip chip" bonding. Even though filler regions 28 are randomly distributed across surfaces 20 and 22, they are small enough yet packed densely enough with respect to pads 46 and 48 to assure that each matching pair of pads is interconnected by at least one metal bridge 32 without any non-matching pads being connected or bridged. In addition, the low viscosity of mixture 16 permits low assembly pressure which facilitates the flip chip assembly operation. In this embodiment the matrix material must be electrically insulative to assure anisotropic electrical connections between the pads.
Referring now to FIG. 14, solid spacer particles are included in the thermally conductive connection of the present invention in order to assure a minimum distance or spacing between the bonded surfaces. For example, glass beads 50 assure that surfaces 20 and 22 are spaced at least a distance L2 from one another. By preventing surfaces 20 and 22 from getting too close, the non-solidified filler is also prevented from spreading so far out laterally that it might connect non-matching pads. The spacer particles are particularly useful when dealing with small pad spacings and need not necessarily be identically sized. As is seen, certain of the filler regions have a larger diameter than the spacer particles to assure continuous filler paths between the surfaces. In this case, at least one of the filler regions contacts both surfaces before any of the spacer particles contact both surfaces. Thereafter, the surfaces are brought closer together until both surfaces contact at least one spacer particle.
Referring now to FIG. 1B, the thermally conductive connection is selectively disposed between the electrical pads on the bonded surfaces. In this embodiment the filler is confined to the area between (and perhaps in the immediate vicinity of) the pads. The area between surfaces 20 and 22 outside pads 46 and 48 is left as open space unless otherwise filled. Therefore, a relatively small amount of mixture 16 will suffice. In addition, glass beads 50 are unnecessary since the filler regions may properly coalesce. However, in comparison to the embodiment of FIG. 13 the overall thermal conductivity between surfaces 20 and 22 is decreased since bridges 32 no longer exist outside the pads. Likewise, the increased presence of the harder adhesive between the pads decreases the thermal conductivity as compared to disposing mostly filler between the pads.
