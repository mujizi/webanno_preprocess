[0051] In these zones, the fuselage comprises a structure that consists of stringers and frames that are uniformly and constantly spaced apart over the entire zone. When the opening has a width that is essentially equal to two frame spans, as illustrated in FIG. 7, the frame with a box shape makes it possible to reduce the space requirement of the inner frame by 50% relative to a ladder-shaped structure of the prior art whose limits are indicated by the dotted lines 92.
[0052] According to another advantage, this box shape simplifies the connection between the door frame and the rest of the fuselage.
[0053] Advantageously, as illustrated in FIG. 5, the first part 72 of the box shape, and more particularly the fourth face 78, can provide the splice function and extend beyond the second part 74 in such a way as to offer a single plane of installation for the second part 74 that forms the skin of the fuselage at the frame and for the skin 42 of the fuselage. This solution reduces the number of parts.
[0054] According to another aspect, the substructure in box shape simplifies the docking of the frame with the rest of the fuselage because of the presence of a single plane of installation contrary to the solutions of the prior art that comprise several planes of installation because of the dropped edges of the intercostal ribs and stiffeners in contact with the skin.
