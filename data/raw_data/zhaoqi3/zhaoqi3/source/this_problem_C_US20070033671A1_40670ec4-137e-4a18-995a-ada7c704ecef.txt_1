[0400] Transcription factor genes that increase leaf fatty acid production, including G975 and its equivalogs could potentially be used to manipulate seed composition, which is very important for the nutritional value and production of various food products. A number of transcription factor genes are involved in mediating an aspect of the regulatory response to temperature. These genes may be used to alter the expression of desaturases that lead to production of 18:3 and 16:3 fatty acids, the balance of which affects membrane fluidity and mitigates damage to cell membranes and photosynthetic structures at high and low temperatures.
[0401] The G652 knockout line had a reproducible increase in the leaf glucosinolate M39480. It also showed a reproducible increase in seed alpha-tocopherol. A number of glucosinolates have been shown to have anti-cancer activity; thus, increasing the levels or composition of these compounds by modifying the expression of transcription factors (e.g., G652), can have a beneficial effect on human diet.
[0402] Glucosinolates are undesirable components of the oilseeds used in animal feed since they produce toxic effects. Low-glucosinolate varieties of canola, for example, have been developed to combat this problem. Glucosinolates form part of a plant's natural defense against insects. Modification of glucosinolate composition or quantity by introducing transcription factors that affect these characteristics can therefore afford increased protection from herbivores. Furthermore, in edible crops, tissue specific promoters can be used to ensure that these compounds accumulate specifically in tissues, such as the epidermis, which are not taken for consumption.
[0403] Presently disclosed transcription factor genes that modify levels of phytosterols in plants may have at least two utilities. First, phytosterols are an important source of precursors for the manufacture of human steroid hormones. Thus, regulation of transcription factor expression or activity could lead to elevated levels of important human steroid precursors for steroid semi-synthesis. For example, transcription factors that cause elevated levels of campesterol in leaves, or sitosterols and stigmasterols in seed crops, would be useful for this purpose. Phytosterols and their hydrogenated derivatives phytostanols also have proven cholesterol-lowering properties, and transcription factor genes that modify the expression of these compounds in plants would thus provide health benefits.
[0404] The composition of seeds, particularly with respect to seed oil amounts and/or composition, is very important for the nutritional and caloric value and production of various food and feed products. Modifying the expression of transcription factor genes that alter seed oil content could be used to improve the heat stability of oils or to improve the nutritional quality of seed oil, by, for example, reducing the number of calories in seed by decreasing oil or fatty acid content, OR increasing the number of calories in animal feeds by increasing fatty acid or seed oil content (e.g., by knocking out G961, G1451, or G2830).
