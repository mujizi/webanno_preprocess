[0077]In the above-described production method of this embodiment, since the ceramic structure 75 has three stacking axes, elements can be arranged utilizing the surfaces that are formed when the sheets are stacked along these stacking axes. That is, elements can be arranged in a three-dimensional matrix shape. Therefore, high integration of the elements can be easily realized, and the degree of freedom of the arrangement of the elements can be increased. Furthermore, the combination of the grid-patterned sheets 39 and the homogeneous sheets 72 can be changed as required in order to easily achieve a high function of the elements and the formation of the elements. Since the dimensions of the elements can be controlled by changing the thicknesses of the sheets 39 and 72 to be stacked, miniaturization of the elements can be easily realized.
[0078]In the second embodiment described above, the pieces 35 and 36 of the striped blocks 37 and the homogeneous blocks 38 in the grid-patterned sheets 39, and the homogeneous sheets 72 are formed using unfired ceramic materials that are not removed by firing. Alternatively, for example, the homogeneous sheets 72 may be formed using a removable material that is removed by firing. In such a case, as shown in FIG. 10, the homogeneous sheets 72 become cavities, i.e., slits after the firing. Accordingly, a ceramic structure 79, i.e., an aggregate in which a plurality of columns 78 are provided upright with slits therebetween can be easily produced. The removable materials described in the first embodiment can be used. In the production of this ceramic structure 79, when the first pieces 35 are formed using an electrode material, the second pieces 36 are formed using a piezoelectric material, and the thickness of each of the first pieces 35 is smaller than the thickness of each of the second pieces 36, each of the columns 78 is a piezoelectric element stack each having a structure in which the piezoelectric material is sandwiched between a pair of electrodes. Accordingly, the ceramic structure 79 has a structure in which the piezoelectric elements are arrayed in a three-dimensional matrix shape.
[0079]Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 11, grid-patterned sheets 130 and grid-patterned sheets 230 may be prepared. In each of the grid-patterned sheets 130, first pieces 135 and homogeneous blocks 138 are made of the same unfired ceramic material, and second pieces 136 are made of a removable material. In each of the grid-patterned sheets 230, first pieces 235 and homogeneous blocks 238 are made of the same unfired ceramic material that is different from the material of the first pieces 135, and second pieces 236 are made of a removable material. The grid-patterned sheets 130 and 230 are alternately stacked in the Z direction and bonded by compression, and the resulting stacked sheets are then fired. Thus, a ceramic structure 175 in which the second pieces 136 and 236 become cavities, i.e., through-holes 176 may be produced. According to this method, the ceramic structure 175 having a honeycomb structure in which different types of ceramics are arranged in a stripe shape in the Z direction can be easily produced.
[0080]In the second embodiment described above, the grid-patterned sheets 39 are produced by cutting the biaxial stack 34 in which the striped sheets 30 and the homogeneous sheets 33 are stacked. Alternatively, grid-patterned sheets may be produced by cutting the biaxial stack shown in FIG. 4 or 5 in the X-Y plane. As shown in FIG. 12A, in a grid-patterned sheet obtained from the biaxial stack shown in FIG. 4, pieces of the same type are arrayed in a line along the stacking direction (Y direction) of the striped sheets 30 and the homogeneous sheet 33. As shown in FIG. 12B, in a grid-patterned sheet obtained from the biaxial stack shown in FIG. 5, pieces of the same type are arrayed in a checkered pattern in the Y direction.
[0081]In the second embodiment described above, the triaxial stack 74 is produced by stacking the grid-patterned sheets 39 so that the first pieces 35 and the second pieces 36 of the grid-patterned sheets 39 are arrayed in a line along the third stacking direction Z. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 13, a triaxial stack may be produced by stacking the grid-patterned sheets 39 so that the first pieces 35 and the second pieces 36 are arrayed in a checkered pattern along the third stacking direction Z.
