Various applications of a refrigerator with a regenerator having a spiral groove formed on a displacer (hereinafter called a refrigerator with a spiral groove) will be described.
FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram of a cosmic radio telescope to which superconductor insulator superconductor (SIS) element a refrigerator with a spiral groove is applied. Radio waves are converged to a secondary focal point of a parabola antenna constituted by a main mirror 110a and a subsidiary mirror 110b. A SIS element 111 for detecting radio waves is mounted at the secondary focal point. A refrigerator 112 for cooling the SIS element 111 is installed with its cylinder shaft being aligned coincident with the axis of radio waves incident to the secondary focal point. Although the incident axis and the cylinder shaft are aligned coincident with each other in FIG. 9, they are not necessarily required to be coincident.
Since the angle of the parabola antenna is changed during the detection of radio waves, the angle of the refrigerator changes correspondingly. Therefore, a conventional refrigerator is unable to be applied to a telescope of this type because a sufficient cooling temperature cannot be obtained. Although this problem is not associated with a telescope of the type that an optical system of a combination of mirrors is used for converging radio waves to a focal point irrespective of the rotation of the telescope, there is a various type of transmission losses generated by reflections. By using the refrigerator with a spiral groove, it becomes possible to directly mount a SIS element at the secondary focal point of a parabola antenna.
Another application to a superconducting magnet unit will be described with reference to FIGS. 10A and 10B.
FIG. 10A is a schematic cross sectional view of a superconducting magnet using a refrigerator with a spiral groove. A refrigerator 120 with a spiral groove is constituted by a motor unit 121, a scotch yoke mechanism 122 for converting a motor rotation into a reciprocal motion, a first stage cylinder 123, and a second stage cylinder 124. Gas pipes, a compressor, and other components are not shown in FIG. 10A. The refrigerator 120 with a spiral groove is mounted in a vacuum container 130 for housing therein the first and second cylinders 123 and 124.
