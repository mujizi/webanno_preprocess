[0014] Other than the radiation heating, there is a method utilizing the heat conduction. In this method, a plate with high thermal conductivity is made contact with the substrate at its backside. This plate is hereinafter called "backing plate". When the backing plate is heated, the substrate is heated through heat transfer by the conduction from the backing plate to the substrate. However, this method cannot be employed in case the backing plate is not used considering the energy-payback-time reduction. In addition, it is difficult to make the baking plate contact with the substrate sufficiently and uniformly. This brings disadvantage that highly efficient and uniform heating is impossible to the backing plate method.
[0015] In addition, by the backing plate method, the substrate is heated only from its backside. As a result, temperature difference in the direction along the substrate thickness easily occurs with thick substrates. Worse, the substrate may suffer a thermal deformation before it is heated up to a required temperature.
[0016] There may be another method where the substrate is heated from both sides by radiation. Even if this method is adopted, it is difficult to keep a balance of heating from both sides because the TCO film that hardly absorbs infrared rays exists on one side of the substrate. Particularly, if this method is carried out placing the substrate under a vacuum pressure, it is almost impossible to heat the substrate from both sides because heat transfer by the convection and the conduction cannot be expected.
[0017] Object of this invention is to solve problems described above.
[0018] To accomplish this object, the invention presents a thin-film deposition apparatus, comprising; a deposition chamber which is a vacuum chamber where thin-film deposition is carried out on a substrate at a deposition temperature higher than room temperature, and a heat chamber connected directly or indirectly with the deposition chamber, wherein the heat chamber is one which heats the substrate under the atmospheric pressure or a pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure, and has a mechanism to heat the substrate supplying gas of a temperature higher than the room temperature by forced convection.
