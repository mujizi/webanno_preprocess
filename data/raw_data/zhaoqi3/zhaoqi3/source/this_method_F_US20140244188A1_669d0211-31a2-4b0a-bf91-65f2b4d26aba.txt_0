[0062] Note while correcting the weather forecasting model, information on both wind direction and wind velocity is required. However, as the sensor at a wind turbine comprises only an anemometer but not for wind direction, data without wind direction is insufficient to provide support for correction later, and further the corrected data set cannot be constructed by directly using measured data from the sensor at the wind turbine. In the embodiments of the present invention, analysis can be carried out in various cases.
[0063] For example, the wind direction can be calculated based on yaw angle of a wind turbine in the wind farm. Note a yaw sensor at the wind turbine usually can measure a relative relationship between current wind direction and yaw orientation of the wind turbine, so absolute wind direction can be estimated based on "yaw wind direction." Since large errors can be caused due to mutual interference between wind turbines, in the embodiments of the present invention yaw wind direction can be corrected so as to obtain hub-height wind direction at a specific wind turbine.
[0064] For example, the wind direction can be calculated based on wind direction at a wind tower in the wind farm. This method is suitable to wind farms located at flat terrain (e.g., plains). Based on the supposition of balance between upstream and downstream wind direction, the observed wind direction at the wind tower can be directly regarded as the wind direction at a specific wind turbine. In this environment, as the airflow within the entire wind farm is stable, the wind direction at the wind tower coincides with the wind direction at each wind turbine and thus can be used as the wind direction at each wind turbine. For wind farms with consistent terrain conditions, this method can greatly simplify the calculation step. However, as terrain exerts a considerable impact on wind turbines at different locations, this method cannot be put into wide application.
[0065] For example, the wind direction can be obtained based on fluid dynamics analysis. For a wind farm at complicated terrain (e.g., mountains, hills, canyons), wind velocity and wind direction at various wind turbines within the wind farm are greatly affected by terrain and thus have large intra-farm difference. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model can be introduced to the wind farm terrain. With physical constraints and diagnostic equation of the CFD model, the wind direction information of the entire wind farm is inverted through wind velocity and wind direction information of several wind towers, and the wind direction resulted from the inversion is corrected according to historical data and yaw wind direction data.
[0066] For another example, the wind direction can be obtained based on actual wind turbine power and theoretical power curve deviation analysis. In the wind power generation field, lots of experience has been accumulated regarding reverse-deriving wind information at a wind turbine from yaw information and actual output power of a generator. Therefore, the wind direction information can be obtained based on these empirical formulas and historical statistical data.
