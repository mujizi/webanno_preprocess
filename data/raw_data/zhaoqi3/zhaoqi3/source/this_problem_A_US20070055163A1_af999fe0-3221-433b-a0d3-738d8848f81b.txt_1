[0109] FIG. 8 shows a schematic of a PPG sensor unit 800 attached to a finger base 802. An array of photodetectors 804 is mounted on a sensor holder 806. The array of photodetectors employed in one embodiment is a linear array that includes 16 photodetectors, but other quantities are also suitable, as are arrays that contain more than a single row of photodetectors. Further, an LED 808 is mounted on the sensor holder 806. Although this embodiment contains an LED 808, other suitable light sources may be used. Both ends of the sensor holder 806 are pulled by a pair of actuators 810. The actuators may be the conducting polymer actuators described in the following section or any other means for applying external pressure to the finger base 802. As a result of the pulling force, the actuators 810, the array of photodetectors 804, and the LED 808 are pressed against the skin with an appropriate pressure. FIG. 8 illustrates conceptual light paths 812 from the LED 808 to the array of photodetectors 804. Depending on the location of a digital artery 814, signals captured by the individual photodetectors in the array 804 are different. Some photodetectors along the light path 812 going through the artery may capture strong pulsate signals, whereas other may contain weak or no signals. Although the exact location of the artery 814 is unknown, the photodetector having the largest signal may be identified by scanning all the signals coming out of the array 804.
[0110] During the scanning of the photodetector array 804, two other variables are varied: LED intensity and the PPG sensor unit pressure. Combining the LED intensity, the PPG sensor unit pressure, and array scan, a three-dimensional search of finding the best signal is performed. FIG. 9 illustrates a process for finding the best pulsatile signal 900. First, the PPG sensor unit 800 is positioned on the finger base 802. Next, the PPG sensor unit pressure applied to the finger base 802 is set to a low pressure of approximately 30 mmHg 902. Then, the LED intensity is slowly increased from a low level (<1 mA) to a high level (15 mA) 904 and the photodetector outputs are scanned to determine which photodetectors of the array 804 contain the pulsatile signal as the intensity is increased 906.
[0111] Ambient light may corrupt the signal received at the array of photodetectors 804. This problem is solved by separating ambient light from the pulsatile signal on the basis of the differential response among detectors of the array, or by synchronous detection based on the known frequency and/or phase of the source. While the DC intensity of the LED is slowly increased, a known periodic (AC--sinusoidal, for example) high frequency (in comparison to the pulse, referring, in preferred embodiments to frequencies above 1 kHz) intensity change is superimposed on the signal. The added periodic intensity change enables the separation of the light emitted from the LED 808 from the surrounding ambient light changes. Also, the added sinusoidal intensity enhances the positioning of the pulsatile waveforms within the photodetector array 804.
[0112] Once the intensity range has been scanned, the LED intensity is set so that the photodetectors towards the center of the array contain the maximum amplitude pulsatile waveform, if available 908. Next, the pressure is increased by 5 mmHg and the same scanning procedure is repeated 910. The procedure continues until a predefined pulsatile amplitude has been achieved or an external pressure of 50 mmHg has been applied to the finger of the patient. The sensor registration may be done continuously or at certain time intervals to correct for movement of the PPG sensor unit 800 around the finger base 802.
[0113] Since the optimal cuff pressure will vary based on the PPG signal obtained, the patient may move the sensor unit 800 around the finger base 802 in order to obtain better a PPG signal and thus, a more comfortable cuff pressure. In one embodiment of the invention, the PPG sensor unit 800 may provide the patient with audio, visual, or tactile cues in order to properly adjust the sensor unit 800 on the finger base 802. Based on the intensity of the pulsatile signals received by the array 804, the unit 800 will assist the patient in registering an optimal signal in a central photodetector. For example, if the intensity of the pulsatile signal is strongest on the right side of the photo detector array 804, the sensor unit 800 may ask the user to shift the unit in a clock-wise direction around the finger base 802 until the signal is centered on the array. The intelligent assistance of the sensor unit 800 helps ensure that an optimal signal is achieved and that a comfortable cuff pressure is achieved. Moreover, the sensor also advantageously ensures that the component of the device that applies external pressure is properly located directly over the artery when, and only when, the optical signal is properly located (by dint of the relationship between the device's geometry, the geometry of the patient's skin/tissue/artery, and patterns of light-propagation through the patient's skin/tissue/artery.
