[0254] After mixing and standing for 24 hrs, the homogeneity of the product is checked. In case of phase separation due to poor solubility of the perfume ingredient(s) an appropriate amount of Sodium p. Cymene Sulfonate or another solubilising agent is added till a homogeneous solution is obtained.
[0255] Cleaning Process:
[0256] Five grams of this solution are evenly applied on the upper side of a ceramic tile (875 square cm, e.g. from Vileroy-Boch). After 1 minute the tile is rinsed with 1 liter of tap water. The tile is then placed in a vertical position for 3 minutes to allow the rinse water to drip off.
[0257] Finally, the tile is placed in a clean and aerated perspex box (38.times.40.times.32 cm) with a removable cover that has a sliding-lid (10.times.10 cm) to allow expert evaluators to smell the interior phase of the box.
[0258] The odor in the box is evaluated just after placing the tile in it (fresh reading) and after 1, 2 and 6 hours.
