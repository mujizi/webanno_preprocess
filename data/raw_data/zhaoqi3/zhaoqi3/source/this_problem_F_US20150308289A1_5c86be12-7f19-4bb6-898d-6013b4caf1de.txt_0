[0007] The downstream radial wall of the intermediate casing therefore comprises openings which each communicate with the intake end of a discharge conduit. Using current technology, the intake end of a discharge conduit is attached by screws to the intermediate casing.
[0008] However, this attachment technology cannot always be used. One of the functions of the assembly of parts (kit engine) is to allow access to equipment and to support systems in the engine compartment during maintenance operations, said equipment and support systems being positioned within the inner collar of said assembly and in particular immediately adjacent to the discharge conduits. It therefore needs to be possible to easily and rapidly dismount said discharge conduits. In certain turbine engines, owing to the equipment in the engine compartment and the shape of the discharge conduits, it is not possible to screw the conduits to the intermediate casing. This constraint is disadvantageous for assembly and maintenance of the engine since it is necessary to mount the conduits and the collars in the same operation. Since the environment is of a very restricted size and the number of operators is limited (especially during maintenance and owing to the size), the current solution is hardly conceivable for the service life of the engine.
[0009] The present invention proposes a simple, effective and economical solution to this problem.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0010] The invention proposes a discharge conduit for a turbine engine, comprising an air intake end, an air outlet end and a tubular sleeve for guiding air between said ends, said air intake end being equipped with means for attachment to an intermediate casing of the turbine engine, characterized in that said attachment means are of the resilient snap-in type.
