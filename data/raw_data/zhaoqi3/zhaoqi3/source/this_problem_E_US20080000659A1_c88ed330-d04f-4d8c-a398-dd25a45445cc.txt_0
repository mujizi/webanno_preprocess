[0020]Electrically actuatable or automatic control valves 36 and 37 are each connected between the hydraulic fluid supply (not shown) and a respective one of the hydraulic lift cylinders 20 and 21 to control extension and retraction of the corresponding hydraulic lift cylinders 20 and 21 in response to signals on lines 50 and 52. The automatic control valves 36 and 37 are electrically coupled to the controller 28. Controller 28 provides command signals to adjust the elevational position of corresponding blade ends through actuation of respective hydraulic lift cylinders 20 and 21. The automatic control valves 36 and 37 are connected in parallel with the manual control valves 34 and 35, respectively, and are operable independently from the manual control valves 34 and 35, as described below.
[0021]The control system further includes a first hydraulic cylinder position sensor 40 for determining the extended position of the first hydraulic cylinder 20 and providing this information to the controller 28. The sensor may be any of a number of known sensors that are suitable for this purpose. The controller 28 is responsive to a control input 45 that specifies the desired height and cross slope of the blade 14. The controller 28 is responsive to control input 45 specifying the desired height, to the hydraulic cylinder position sensor 40, and to the inclinometer 48, for providing valve control signals to the first and second hydraulic valves 36 and 37. In one automatic mode, the controller 28 provides a first valve control signal on line 50 to the first hydraulic valve 36 in dependence upon desired height specified by the control input 45, and the control 28 provides a second valve control signal on line 52 to the second hydraulic valve 37 in dependence upon the inclinometer output on line 60 and upon the cross slope specified by the control input 45.
[0022]A difficulty encountered with this arrangement occurs when the control input on line 50 calls for movement of cylinder 20, or when the valve 36 is actuated in such a way as to call for movement of cylinder 20. If the inclinometer output were to be used to determine the control signal on line 52, no corresponding change in the extension or retraction of the cylinder 21 would be effected quickly, resulting in the blade 14 being inaccurately oriented. The present invention eliminates this problem by using the hydraulic cylinder position sensor 40. During times when the blade 14 is to be moved upward or downward, the control 28 provides the second valve control signal 52 to the second hydraulic valve 37 in dependence upon the hydraulic cylinder position sensor 40 which determines the extended position of the first hydraulic cylinder 20, such that the second hydraulic cylinder 21 extends and retracts in a manner corresponding to the extension and retraction of the first hydraulic cylinder 20. The amount of extension or retraction of the hydraulic cylinder is a function of the geometry of the cylinders and blade support components and linkages, but is effected in such a way as to keep the cross slope angle cut by the blade 14 constant. It will be appreciated that this will eliminate the inaccuracies that have resulted from inclinometer damping and the resulting signal delay.
[0023]It will be appreciated that it may be desired that the second cylinder 21 be controlled in a closed loop manner, rather than being driven open loop. A control system using such closed loop control is shown in FIG. 3. In FIG. 3, elements which correspond to those shown in FIG. 2 are designated by the same reference numerals. In the system of FIG. 3, the inaccuracies that might result from actuating valve 37 in an open loop drive are eliminated by the addition of hydraulic cylinder position sensor 62 to the hydraulic cylinder 21, providing an indication to the controller 28 of the amount of extension of cylinder 21. This permits closed loop control of cylinder 21 so that extension and retraction are measured, and are caused to track precisely the desired extension and retraction.
[0024]With reference to FIG. 3, the control system 12 controls the orientation of the grader blade 14 of motor grader 10. During operation of the motor grader 10, the grade and cross-slope positions of blade 14 may be controlled by manual or automatic extension and retraction of the hydraulic lift cylinders 20 and 21 connected to the blade sub-assembly 16. The pair of hydraulic lift cylinders 20 and 21 may be retracted and extended to raise and lower the corresponding sides of the blade 14 relative to the frame 18.
