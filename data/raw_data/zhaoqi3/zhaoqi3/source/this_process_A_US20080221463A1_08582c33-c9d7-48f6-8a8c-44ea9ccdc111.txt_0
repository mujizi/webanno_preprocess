[0036]At wavelengths where hemoglobin has a low absorption, the AC offset is expected to be primarily due to the effects of venous pulsation. Hemoglobin has a sufficiently low absorption at a wavelength in the range of 1,050-1,350 nm. Due to local water and blood pooling, changes in the water component of the AC spectrum were also observed in some subjects. So that these water changes do not confound the detection of venous pulsation, it may be desirable to further narrow the wavelength range to about 1,050-1,160 nm. FIG. 4 illustrates Ratrat.sub.Hb calculated where IR.sub.Hb is 1,126 nm and IR is 918 nm.
[0037]In the graphs illustrated in FIG. 4, the Ratrat.sub.Hb of the selected wavelengths are plotted on the y-axis 50 against time on the x-axis 52. Data points 54 represent the calculated Ratrat.sub.Hb when a subject was in an erect position, and data points 56 represent the calculated Ratrat.sub.Hb when a subject was in the Trendelenburg position. When pressure is not applied to a forehead sensor, as in these trials, it can be assumed that placing a subject in the Trendelenburg position will cause venous pulsation. As can be seen from the graphs in FIG. 1, the Ratrat.sub.Hb was substantially higher for each subject when venous pulsation was likely to be present (data points 56) than when it was not (data points 54). In addition, the Ratrat.sub.Hb was generally consistent when venous pulsation was not likely to be present (data points 54), as illustrated by trendline 58.
[0038]As a result of these studies, an offset metric may be derived to predict the presence of venous pulsation in subjects with more accuracy than that seen with previous methods of detecting venous pulsation. This offset metric may be the Ratrat.sub.Hb itself or a change in Ratrat.sub.Hb from historical values (.DELTA.Ratrat.sub.Hb). FIG. 5 is a flow chart of a process 60 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In this process 60, the presence of venous pulsation is detected based on the offset metric.
[0039]As illustrated in FIG. 5, at least two digital near-IR waveforms 62 are provided. These waveforms 62 correspond to detected light at the IR and IR.sub.Hb wavelengths. The Ratrat.sub.Hb is calculated (Block 64) for IR.sub.Hb to IR, for example, as described above in Eq. 4. A current Ratrat.sub.Hb 66 may be compared (Block 70) to historical values 68 of Ratrat.sub.Hb. The historical values 68 may include actual values calculated from a given patient or average values calculated from other subjects. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the process 60 may use average values as the historical values 68. Once enough data has been collected to provide a reliable baseline for an individual patient, that patient's actual measurement data may be utilized as the historical values 68. In addition, the historical values 68 may be represented as an average, weighted average, mean, median, or mode.
[0040]An offset metric 72 may be derived from the current Ratrat.sub.Hb 66 and the historical values 68. This offset metric 72 may be the difference between the current Ratrat.sub.Hb 66 and the historical values 68, denoted .DELTA.Ratrat.sub.Hb, the current Ratrat.sub.Hb 66, or a combination thereof. The offset metric 72 may be compared to a threshold 74 to determine if the threshold 74 is exceeded (Block 76). Threshold 74 may be a pre-determined value or may be based on the historical values 68 of the Ratrat.sub.Hb. For example, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, threshold 74 may be a fixed value for all patients above which venous pulsation is expected to be present. Alternatively, threshold 74 may be a fixed value based on a patient's physical characteristics, such as, for example, sex, weight, race, and age. In accordance with another embodiment, threshold 74 may be a change from a patient's actual historical values 68. That is, threshold 74 may be a fixed value or percentage above a baseline of a patient's historical values 68.
