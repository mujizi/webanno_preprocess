[0002] When optical telecommunications transmissions are made in optic fibers, a number of channels can be transmitted in parallel at various wavelengths. This method of data transmission is referred to as WDM (wavelength division multiplexing). The bandwidth necessary for this is predefined essentially by the bandwidth of the available fiber amplifiers. At present, these are predominantly C band and L band erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA). In order to increase the data rate which can be transmitted on a fiber for a given channel data rate, the channel spacing is to be reduced. When the channel spacing is reduced, non-linearities in the optical fiber give rise to increasingly strong interactions between the channels, which limit the range of the data transmission.
[0003] WDM systems can be divided into unidirectional systems and bidirectional systems. In a unidirectional system, all the channels in one fiber propagate codirectionally, while in a bidirectional system channel groups in one fiber contra-propagate. Adjacent channels which respectively propagate contra-directionally with respect to one another constitute a special case in this respect. This method of operation is referred to here as "bidirectional interleaved". With respect to non-linearities, the effective channel spacing here is twice as large as the physical channel spacing. This reduces the non-linear interference. The method of operation with bidirectional interleaved channel arrangement, therefore, presents advantages in this respect.
[0004] In this method of operation with bidirectional interleaved channel arrangement, it has been necessary up until now to use one amplifier per direction per band. In the case of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA), 2 C band amplifiers and 2 L band amplifiers are therefore necessary. If operations are carried out with only one frequency band, one amplifier is necessary for each direction, therefore making a total of two amplifiers.
[0005] Because the number of amplifiers or generally the number of directionally acting influencing elements of the data signals constitutes a significant cost factor in the implementation of a data transmission link, an object of the present invention is to find a method and a device which enable the number of influencing elements to be reduced in comparison with the prior art.
[0006] The inventors have recognized that it is possible to halve the number of necessary direction-oriented influencing elements, for example EDFA or DCF, through skillful use of the channel arrangement of a WDM system and corresponding systematic and direction-dependent distribution of the data signals between the individual channels; for example, via a bidirectional interleaved channel arrangement. In this context, the signals coming from the two sides are oriented in one propagation direction in an intermediate period, fed to at least one influencing element and the data signals are then forwarded again in the two different, original propagation directions in accordance with the arrangement of the channels.
