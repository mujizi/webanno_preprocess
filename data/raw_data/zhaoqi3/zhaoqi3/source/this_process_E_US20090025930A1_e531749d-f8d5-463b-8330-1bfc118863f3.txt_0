[0069]The controller may then warn the operator of injury should the clamp not be securely connected. The operator may verify the warning. The controller may then close valve V3 and apply pressure to the flow nipple 327 by opening valve V2 and then closing valve V2. If the clamp is not securely engaged, drilling fluid will leak past the seals 333. The controller may verify sealing integrity by monitoring pressure sensor G3. Alternatively or additionally, the clamp may include one or more sensors operable to detect proper closure of the clamp and/or engagement of the clamp 300 with the CFS housing 250. The sensors may be in electrical communication with the controller. For example, a first sensor may detect engagement of the locators 329 with the openings 202 a second sensor may detect tension in the clamp bands 318, 319, and a third sensor may detect engagement of the profiles 320p, 322p. If the controller detects improper position or engagement of the clamp from any of the sensors, the controller may not proceed and generate an alarm message to the operator. The operator may then take remedial action.
[0070]The controller may then relieve pressure from the nipple 327 by opening valve V3. The controller may then close valve V3. The controller may then illuminate the "Ready to Remove CFS Plug" indicator. The operator may confirm by pushing the "Remove Plug" Button. The controller may then supply hydraulic fluid to the retrieval piston 301 via port 337 and then relieve pressure from the hydraulic port 337, thereby removing the CFS plug 250, as discussed above. Once the plug 250 is removed, the controller may verify removal by monitoring G3 and illuminate "Ready to Switch Flow to CFS". The operator may confirm by pushing the "Start CFS Flow" button. The controller may then open valve V2 to inject the drilling fluid through flow nipple 327 and into the drill string through the port 201. Pressure may then equalize and allow the spring 223 to move the poppet 220 into the closed position, thereby closing the float valve 210/V4. The controller may then close valve V1 and open valve V5, thereby relieving pressure from the top drive or Kelly swivel 7. The controller may verify that the float valve 210N4 is closed by monitoring pressure sensor G2.
[0071]The controller may then illuminate the "Safe to Break Connection" indicator. The operator may then break the connection between the Kelly 4/top drive and press the "Connection Broken" button. The operator may then raise the Kelly 4/top drive, engage a stand/joint, and hoist the stand/joint into position to be made up with the CFS 200. During this process, the controller may monitor the pressure sensors G1-G3 and the flow meter FM to verify proper operation. The controller may then illuminate the "Safe to Make Connection" indicator. The operator may then make up the connection between the stand/joint and CFS 200, make up the connection between the Kelly 4/top drive and the stand/joint, and press the "Connection Made" button. The controller may then close valve V5 and illuminate the "Ready to Switch Flow to Kelly" indicator. The operator may then press the "Start Kelly Flow" button. The controller may open the valve V1, thereby allowing drilling fluid flow from the mud pump 18, through the line 19, and into the top drive or Kelly swivel 7. The float valve V4/210 may open in response to drilling fluid flow through the top drive or Kelly swivel 7.
[0072]The controller may verify opening of the valve V1 by monitoring the pressure sensor G2. The controller may then close valve V2 and illuminate the "Ready to Install CFS Plug" indicator. The operator may confirm by pressing the "Install Plug" button. The controller may then supply hydraulic fluid to the port 337, thereby moving the retrieval piston 301 and placing the plug 250 into the port 201. The controller may then supply hydraulic fluid to the port 338, thereby moving the retaining piston 302 into engagement with the plug 250. The controller may then relieve pressure from the hydraulic port 337, thereby disengaging the retrieval piston 301. The controller may then relieve pressure from the hydraulic port 338, thereby disengaging the retaining piston 302. The controller may then relieve pressure from the flow nipple by opening valve V3. The controller may then close valve V3 and test plug integrity by opening and closing valve V2 and monitoring pressure sensor G3. The controller may then relieve pressure from the flow nipple by opening valve V3.
[0073]The controller may then illuminate the "Remove Clamp" indicator. The operator may disengage the clamp, open the clamp, and transport the clamp away from the CFS. The operator may confirm by pressing the "Clamp Removed" Button. The operator may disengage the slips, return the mud pump flow rate (if it was changed from the drilling flow rate), and resume drilling. The added stand/joint may include an additional CFS 200 connected at a top thereof so that the process may be repeated when an additional joint/stand needs to be added. A similar process may be employed if/when the drill string needs to be tripped, such as for replacement of the drill bit 20. If, at any time, a dangerous situation should occur, the emergency stop ESTOP button may be pressed, thereby opening the vent valves V3, V5, V6 and closing the supply valves V1 and V2, (some of the valves may already be in those positions). If the interface is digital, the ESTOP button may be a mechanical button separate from the controller display or the ESTOP may be integrated with the display.
