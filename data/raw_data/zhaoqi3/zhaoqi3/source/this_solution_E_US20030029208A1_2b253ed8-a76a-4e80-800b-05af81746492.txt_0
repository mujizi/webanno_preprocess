[0007] The attachment mechanism has a moveable locking member that engages a security slot defined in a wall of the portable device. The locking member, in an engagement configuration, cooperates with the security slot, the housing and possibly other elements of the attachment mechanism to inhibit reconfiguration of the locking member to a disengagement configuration in which the locking member may be disengaged from the security slot.
[0008] These solutions achieve a primary goal of such devices, namely to inhibit the unauthorized movement of the portable electronic device. For portable electronic devices that are secured in public or semi-public areas, simple security against unauthorized movement is not sufficient to inhibit unauthorized use of the device while it is securely localized.
[0009] The prior art provides physical security solutions that do inhibit use of a portable electronic device while securing the device to a location. One such solution is a carrying case that completely surrounds the portable device and prevents any access or use of the device. A security device may simultaneously maintain the carrying case (with portable device inside) closed, and localized to an object. While this achieves the simultaneous goals of limiting access to the portable electronic device and inhibiting its movement, this solution is undesireable in situations in which a user desires convenient access to the portable electronic device. One such application is use of a laptop in a library or other public resource room. The user desires to access the laptop to records notes, for example, but inhibit operation and movement of the laptop while the user moves about the library. The user desires to quickly re-access the laptop upon returning to the laptop's location. The carrying case solution is too cumbersome for all users in similar situations.
[0010] The present invention is an efficient, cost effective and convenient physical security solution to the problem of providing access control to portable electronic devices while preserving anti-movement characteristics.
[0011] In a preferred embodiment, the invention includes an apparatus for attaching to a first wall defining a security aperture. The apparatus includes a housing; a locking flange, extending from the housing, having a first orientation relative to the security aperture for retention into the security aperture and a second orientation relative to the security aperture for removal from the security aperture, the locking flange transformable from the first orientation to the second orientation; and a locking member, coupled to the housing and cooperative with the locking flange, for engaging an edge of the first wall outside of the security aperture and inhibiting transformation of the locking flange from the first orientation to the second orientation.
