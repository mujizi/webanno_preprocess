[0281] Here, the electrostatic attraction force F generated between the vibration plate electrode 16 and the electrode 12a increases in inverse proportion to the distance between the electrodes. Thus, it is important to form a small distance of the air gap 14a (air gap distance g) between the electrode 12a and the vibration plate 19.
[0282] Then, as mentioned above, a small air gap can be formed with sufficient accuracy by forming the air gap 14a by the sacrifice layer etching method A description will now be given, with reference to FIGS. 24A through 24F, of a manufacturing method of the inkjet head according to the present embodiment. Each of FIGS. 24A through 24F is a cross-sectional view taken along a line parallel to the shorter side of the vibration plate.
[0283] In this process, the actuator is produced by sequentially depositing an electrode material, a sacrifice layer material and a vibration plate material on the actuator substrate 1.
[0284] First, as shown in FIG. 24A, a thermal oxidation film, which corresponds to the insulating layer 11, is deposited onto a silicon substrate, which has a plane direction of (100) and corresponds to the substrate 1, by a wet oxidation method, for example, with a thickness of about 1.0 .mu.m. Then, polysilicon which turns to the electrode layer 12 is deposited on the insulating layer 11 with a thickness of 0.4 .mu.m, and phosphorus is doped into the polysilicon of the electrode layer 12 so as to reduce a resistance. After forming separation grooves 82 in the electrode layer 12 by a lithography etching method (a photographic process technique and an etching technique), that is, after forming the electrodes 12a and dummy electrodes 12b, a high-temperature oxide film (HTO film) is formed with a thickness of 0.25 .mu.m as the insulating layer 13. At this time, the separation grooves 82 of the electrode layer 12 are filled by the insulating layer 13 so that the surface of the insulation layer 13 is flat. It should be noted that the electrode 12a is extended to the electrode pad 55.
[0285] Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 24B, after depositing the polysilicon, which serves as the sacrifice layer 14, on the insulating layer 13 with a thickness of 0.5 .mu.m, separation grooves 82 are formed in the sacrifice layer 14 by a lithography etching method, and further a high-temperature oxide film (HTO film) is deposited with a thickness of 0.1 to 0.3 .mu.m as the insulating layer 15. At this time, the width of the separation grooves 84 is preferably equal to a width by which the separation grooves 84 can be filled by the structural layers such as the insulating layer 15. Although it depends on the thickness of the vibration plate 19, it is preferable to set the width equal to or less than 2.0 .mu.m. In the present embodiment, the width of the separation grooves 84 is set to 0.5 .mu.m.
