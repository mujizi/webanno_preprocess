The resulting solution was transferred to a flat ceramic dish, dried in a forced air oven at 120.degree. C. and then calcined at 600.degree. C. (initially in 4%O.sub.2 /96%N.sub.2 for 6 hours followed by air at 600.degree. C. for 1 hour). Pt and Rh were then added at a loading of 0.8 wt. % (Pt/Rh=5), the composition re-calcined at 600.degree. C. in air and finally aged at 1140.degree. C. in 10%H.sub.2 O/90%N.sub.2 for 6 hours. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed the presence of two phases: Zr-doped CeO.sub.2 and Ce-doped ZrO.sub.2, as shown in FIG. 9.
Example 9
The procedure of Example 8 was repeated, but with the inclusion of La to give a mole ratio of Ce:Zr:La=5.33:4.41:1. 280 grams of Ce nitrate (20 wt. % Ce) solution, 204 grams of Zr nitrate (14.8 wt. % Zr) solution and 43.4 grams of La nitrate (24 wt. % La) solution were added to 300 grams of deionized water. To this solution were added 301 grams of d-sorbitol. The resultant solution was dried, calcined, and aged as described in Example 8.
The X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis now shows only the presence of one phase after aging, i.e., shifted CeO.sub.2 phases, as shown in FIG. 14. No phases associated with Zr or La are detected, thus showing that the La and Zr have doped the CeO.sub.2.
Examples 10 and 11 show that these same effects are observed when alumina is included and the mixed-metal oxide is supported on the alumina.
