In Vitro Drug Release Kinetics of Permanent Drug-Eluting Stents with Absorbable Polymeric Coating Matrix and Incorporated Antiproliferative Immunosuppressant Rapamycin Showing the Influence of Base Coat Thickness, and of Top Coat Thickness on the Release Profile
[0087] A 0.3% w/w solution of P4HB (TephaFLEX.RTM. Biomaterial from Tepha, Inc. Mw 300-600K) and the immunomodulator rapamycin of 85:15% w/w in chloroform was prepared. Metallic coronary stents were spray-coated with this solution as a base coat, until a coating layer thickness of 10-20 micrometer was achieved, which is equivalent to a drug content of 1-2 .mu.g per mm.sup.2 of stent surface area. The stents were then spray-coated with a 0.3% w/w/ solution of P4HB until a top-coated thickness of 5-15 micrometer was achieved in order to establish different diffusion barriers for retarded drug release. After 24 h storage in vacuo to remove the chloroform, the stents were mounted on standard balloon catheters and afterwards deployed to a nominal diameter of 3.5 mm. The stents were then stored in 2 ml of a 0.9% sodium chloride solution and incubated at 37.degree. C. After different time points, aliquots were taken from the elution medium for analysis of released drug, the elution medium was changed, and the stents were put back to storage. The aliquots were analyzed by HPLC.
[0088] FIG. 4 displays the in vitro drug release profiles of sample stents, showing the effect of top coat and base coat thicknesses on the drug release profile at a constant drug concentration. The use of a top-coat retarded the drug release (stent 85:15-1 compared to stent 85:15-2). The use of a thicker top-coat retarded the drug release further (stents 85:15-1 and 85:15-2 compared to stent 85:15-3). The use of a thinner base coat reduces the amount of drug released (stent 85:15-1) compared to stent 85:15-1).
