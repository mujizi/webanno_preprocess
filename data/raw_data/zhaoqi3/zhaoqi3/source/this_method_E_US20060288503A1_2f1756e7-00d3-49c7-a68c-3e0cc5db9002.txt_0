DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
[0015] The following description is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.
[0016] Referring to FIG. 1, shown is a simplified flow diagram of a method of automatically aligning an aircraft-engaging end of a passenger boarding bridge to a doorway disposed along a lateral surface of an aircraft, according to an embodiment of the instant invention. At step 100, an image of a first portion of the lateral surface of the aircraft is captured using an imager disposed at a location that is remote from the aircraft. For instance, the imager is disposed near the aircraft-engaging end of the passenger boarding bridge. Some non-limiting examples of imager types that are suitable for use with this method include: a digital still camera; a digital video camera, etc. At step 102, data relating to the captured image is processed to identify a feature that is indicative of a location of the doorway. For instance, image data is provided from the imager to a processor of an automated bridge controller. Features that may be identified include but are not limited to: the door outline; the doorsill; the door handle; the door window, etc. At decision step 104, it is determined whether a feature that is indicative of a location of the doorway is identified. When a feature that is indicative of a location of the doorway is not identified, then at step 106 the image of the first portion of the lateral surface is displayed to a user aboard the aircraft. At step 108 an indication from the user is received, the indication relating to the location of the doorway relative to the image of the first portion of the lateral surface. At step 110, a feature indicative of a location of the doorway is identified in dependence upon the indication from the user and the data relating to the image of the first portion of the lateral surface. The method terminates at step 114, and automated alignment of the aircraft-engaging end of the passenger boarding bridge occurs. If at decision step 104 if it is determined that a feature that is indicative of a location of the doorway is identified, then the method terminates at step 114, and automated alignment of the aircraft-engaging end of the passenger boarding bridge occurs.
[0017] Optionally, at step 106 the image of the first portion of the lateral surface is displayed to a user at a remote location that is not aboard the aircraft. For instance, the user is located in a control room within the airport terminal building or at another remote location. In this way, one user may assist with the alignment of a plurality of passenger boarding bridges at a same airport or at different airports without actually being required to go to the different passenger boarding bridges. In the examples provided below, it is assumed that the user is aboard the aircraft, but it should be understood that optionally the user is located at a remote location that is not aboard the aircraft.
[0018] Referring now to FIG. 2, shown is a simplified block diagram of a system according to an embodiment of the instant invention. The system includes components shown generally at 200, which are disposed at a location that is remote from the aircraft, and components shown generally at 202, which are disposed aboard the aircraft. By way of one non-limiting example, which is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to in any way limit the scope of the invention, the components 200 are disposed near an aircraft-engaging end of a passenger boarding bridge, and the components 202 are disposed in the cockpit area of an aircraft. The components 200 include an imager 204, a processor 206 such as for instance a processor of an automated bridge controller 208, a transmitter 210 and a receiver 212. The components 202 include a receiver 214, a display device 216, a user interface 218 and a transmitter 220. Optionally, the components 200 also include at least a light (not shown) for illuminating the lateral surface of the aircraft including the doorway when operating under poor lighting conditions. For instance, a light source such as for instance a bank of lights is provided for illuminating the lateral surface of the aircraft including the doorway during nighttime operation. Further optionally, a plurality of light sources, such as for instance a plurality of light banks, is provided to support operation of the system under a variety of poor lighting conditions. For instance, two or more banks of lights are used simultaneously to illuminate the lateral surface of the aircraft including the doorway when operating in rainy or snowy conditions.
