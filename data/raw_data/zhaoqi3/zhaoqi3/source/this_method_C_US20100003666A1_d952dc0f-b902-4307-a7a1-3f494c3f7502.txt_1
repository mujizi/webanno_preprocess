[0031] Another method for detecting biomolecules and their interactions is the bead agglutination assay (Coombs et al., British Journal of Experimental Pathology 1945, 26, 255-266; Reis et al., Transfusion 1993, 33, 639-643). In this assay the aggregation of multiple beads or cells into clumps mediated by some biomolecular recognition event is usually detected as a change in the optical properties of a solution containing the suspended beads/nanoparticles. In this type of system the aggregation is very dependent on the ratio of microparticles/nanoparticles to molecule of interest (FIG. 2) and so will only lead to a positive detection if the concentration is within an optimum range. Macroscale methods can be utilized to increase this range, but require centrifugation and resuspension of aggregate (FIG. 3). These manual operations are not easily performed in a portable system, and are expensive and time consuming.
[0032] Flow cytometry (FC) and laser scanning cytometry (LSC) are some of the most widely used techniques for single cell analysis. Well characterized distributions of cellular behavior are often observed using flow cytometry. Briefly, this technique involves the hydrodynamic isolation of individual cells that have been previously labeled using fluorescent dyes that reveal information about the quantity of biomolecules of interest within that cell. A light source, filtering mechanism, and detector are present to observe these signals of individual cells. The technique is a very high throughput serial process, where in most cases cells are discarded after analysis.
[0033] Flow cytometry has been the most successfully used technique for single cell analysis because of the massive throughput; however it has been limited in most cases to characterizing fluorescent signals (GFP-fusion proteins, immunofluorescence, and fluorogenic substrates to intracellular enzymes)(Fayet al., Biochemistry 1991, 30, 5066-5075; Nolan et al., Nature Biotechnology 1998, 16, 633-638; and Krutzik et al., Nature Methods 2006, 3, 361-368). Additionally, it does not address important time dependent measurements of the same individual cell, or spatial localization of fluorescence within a cell. Cells analyzed using this method are usually grown in a flask or dish before analysis, and so uniformity of environment is limited to that of the flask or dish. Notably, cell-cell contact is not controllable, and diffusible secretions are maintained in the culture environment.
[0034] Laser scanning cytometry (LSC), a technique where dyes on surface immobilized cells are excited by a scanning laser, and can be repeatedly interrogated in time is an alternative technique that has been employed (Griffin et al., Febs Letters 2003, 546, 233-236; Bedner et al., Cytometry 1998, 33, 1-9). Here, an advantage over FC, time dependent information can be obtained in individual cells, and adherent cells can be maintained in the primary site of culture during analysis. However, LSC sacrifices throughput as only a limited region of a plate can be scanned. Additionally, time and throughput has somewhat of a tradeoff, as scanning more cells will lead to an increased time between measurements for individual cells. For LSC introduction of reagents is done by pipette and only slow time dependent changes after solution exchange are meaningful. This is particularly due to uneven introduction of solution over the whole slide or plate, and the serial process of laser scanning. As in FC, the cells are maintained on a slide or dish, and the environment is not well controlled.
[0035] In order to address the aspects of environmental control, fast timescale measurements, image processing, and secreted biomolecule isolation, several methods of single cell isolation have been developed. A number of microfluidic techniques have been reported to allow optical interrogation of individual cells integrated with fast exchange of reagents.
