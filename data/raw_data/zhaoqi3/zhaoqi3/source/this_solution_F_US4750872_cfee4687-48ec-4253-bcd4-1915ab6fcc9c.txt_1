It should suitably be noted that the rotor 208 may be advantageously obtained by injection of a plastic material into a mould, wherein the permanent magnets are positioned as inserts.
In order to allow low friction and an excellent centering of the rotor 208, the cylindrical through cavity 223 has, at its two ends 247 and 248, a diameter which is smaller than that which can be found in the intermediate area 249, so as to practically create only two sliding areas, indicated at 250.
With this solution it is not necessary to provide any element interposed between the rotor 208 and the fixed pin 237.
In its part proximate to the plate-like portion 213, the rotor 208 is provided with a deep annular cavity 251, having internally peripheral teeth 252 which allow for the positioning of a sector 253, and may be made of material such as rubber or elastomer, and advantageously provided with a matchingly shaped set of teeth which holds it still within the cavity 251, in the position it was inserted in.
Said rotor 208 is further provided with a toroidal protruding edge 254 which, as will be seen, will be suitable for hooking to the impeller 211.
