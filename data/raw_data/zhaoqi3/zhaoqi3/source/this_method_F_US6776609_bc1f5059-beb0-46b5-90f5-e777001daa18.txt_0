d. utilizing a recirculation inlet and a recirculation outlet for recirculated flue gas wherein for said recirculation inlet is coupled to said take-off point; and
e. contacting the combustion generator with excess air and recirculated flue gas-air mixtures, wherein said switching between full excess air and recirculated flue gas-air mixtures to result in a mass of air which is provided to the said combustion chamber and a results in a reduced fan size of about 50% from conventional and reduced electrical power needed for fans to provide full excess air or recirculated flue gas is about 50% or less of comparable conventional combustion systems.
An embodiment of this method wherein the means for control of the flue gas-air ratio is selected from an adjustable damper, an on-off damper, digital control, analog control or combinations thereof.
The other embodiments listed above for the apparatus are incorporated by reference here for the method.
FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of the convention (prior art) "single-point" positioning control system as improved by U.S. Ser. No. 10/423,680 and further improved by the present invention.
