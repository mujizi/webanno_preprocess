EXAMPLE 27D
1-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]azetidine-3-carboxylic acid
[0169] A solution of Example 27C (2.6 g, 10.0 mmol) in a mixture of THF (20 mL) and water (10 mL) was treated with LiOH.H.sub.2O (830 mg, 20.0 mmol) in water (5 mL). Methanol was added until a transparent solution formed (1 mL). This solution was heated at 60.degree. C. overnight and the organic solvents were removed under vacuum. The residual aqueous solution was acidified with 2 N HCl to pH 2 and was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic phase was washed with water, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered and concentrated to give Example 27D (2.3 g, 90% yield). MS (DCI/NH.sub.3) m/z 235 (M+H).sup.+.
