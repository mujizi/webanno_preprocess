[0074] FIG. 33 illustrates a Delay Cell for delay Line.
[0075] FIG. 6 illustrates a typical SAR ADC comprising of a DAC consisting of n relative weighted capacitors (or other elements in other embodiments) for example [64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]. Due to mismatch the relative weights of these capacitors varies e.g. weights now are [63.2, 31.7, 15.8, 7.5, 3.8, 2.1, 1.3]. For calibration to take place the magnitude, and hence errors, of each capacitor has to be determined and compensated in the digital domain. To measure one of the capacitors it must be modulated by a PN sequence, the resulting voltage converted by the ADC, the digital values correlated with a PN sequence and finally the DC value determined (as shown in FIGS. 7a and 7b). However this would yield a foreground calibration scheme.
[0076] The principle of using a PN sequence to measure an analog quantity is shown in FIG. 7a. An additional voltage or element .DELTA..sub.i (causing a voltage change) is multiplied by the pseudo random sequence q and is added to the input signal. This combined signal is processed by the ADC, converting it to a digital value. Multiplication of the digital value by the pseudo random sequence performs a correlation operation, the correlation value may be low pass filtered by an ideal integrator. This can be achieved by performing an accumulation and average operation. The output of the operation is a measure of the added element D(.DELTA..sub.i). Note the input signal is removed as it is not correlated with the pseudo random sequence. This methodology can be used for calibration in pipeline ADCs. Each stage of the pipeline may be calibrated using the following stages as an n-bit ADC. As shown in FIG. 7b a gain error may be detected by the same method, the gain error is multiplied by the known value added to the input signal. The value of .epsilon. may be extracted and be calibrated for.
[0077] FIG. 8 illustrates operation of the calibration scheme according to the invention. In order to achieve a background calibration scheme each capacitor to be calibrated must be broken into m sub-capacitors in a DAC. As shown in FIG. 8 one of the sub-capacitors is chosen at random to be multiplied by a PN sequence generated. A redundant capacitor is used to approximately make-up the loss in the capacitor to be calibrated when it used for conversion. By using each of the sub-elements in turn the value determined by correlation is equal to
