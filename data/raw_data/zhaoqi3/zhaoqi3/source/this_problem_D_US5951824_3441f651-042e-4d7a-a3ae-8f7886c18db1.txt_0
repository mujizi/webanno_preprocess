Presses which employ a concave shoe engaged against a backing roll, such as the Extended Nip.RTM. press manufactured by Beloit Corporation of Beloit, Wis., are used in a papermaking machine for increasing the residence time of a web during passage of the web through a pressing nip. Typically, a nip is defined as the narrow region about the line of co-tangency when two rolls with aligned axes are brought together. The nip between rolls has classically been used in papermaking to remove water from the web, and to compress the fibers in the web into a smooth surface. In the papermaking art, it has been found to be desirable to increase the length of the nip, resulting in a somewhat lower pressure and uniform pressing, and increased effectiveness of pressing of the paper web. Initially, the length of the nip was increased by coating one or both of the rolls with a compliant material. The use of a compliant roll system allowed for nips somewhat greater than an inch in length along the direction of the web through the nip.
The desire for even longer nips led to the development of the so-called Extended Nip.RTM. press, or ENP. The ENP employs a backing roll and an elongated shoe, where the elongated shoe has a concave surface with a radius of curvature slightly larger than that of the convex surface of the backing roll. The shoe, which is typically made of steel, cooperates with the backing roll over a nip length of approximately ten inches along the direction of travel of the paper web.
In this configuration, the shoe is stationary. Thus, without further modification, a paper web moving through the nip formed between the shoe and the backing roll would experience unacceptable rubbing on the stationary shoe. To overcome this problem, a bearing blanket forming a cylindrical tube is slidably disposed over the shoe and around the support shaft on which the shoe is mounted. This bearing blanket supports the paper web as it passes through the nip. To reduce friction forces between the bearing blanket and the shoe, lubricant is supplied between the bearing blanket and the shoe, allowing the bearing blanket to slide freely across the shoe on a film of lubricant. A shoe of this type is known as a hydrodynamic shoe.
The type of lubricant used affects the thickness of the film layer. Higher viscosity lubricants create thicker film layers than do low viscosity lubricants; however, increased horsepower is needed to drive the backing roll. In addition, as the rotational speed of the backing roll decreases, the thickness of the film layer decreases. Thus, where the backing roll is operating at low speed, it is difficult to maintain the film layer.
To aid in drying or pressing of the paper web, a felt, or web support blanket, often underlies and supports the paper web as it transits the nip between the backing roll and the bearing blanket on the shoe. The backing rolls, paper web, and web support blanket (if present) are frictionally engaged, and in turn engage the upper surface of the bearing blanket, causing the bearing blanket to slide over the shoe and rotate about the shoe and its support shaft.
