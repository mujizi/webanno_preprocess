[0041] Depending on the processing methods and specific polymer materials, the aforementioned techniques can generate any number of polysiloxane-polyphosphazene structures. In this aspect, for example, the disclosed methods can provide the combination of polysiloxane-polyphosphazene in the form of a combination of homopolymers, copolymers, grafted copolymers, crosslinked structures, and/or interpenetrating networks, and the like. For example, the methods disclosed herein can generate homogeneously structured, indistinguishable intrinsic composite polymer networks, or heterogeneously structured copolymers, in which the different polymer phases form distinguishable, separated domains with a nano-, meso-, or microstructure. In another aspect, for example, the disclosed techniques can generate extrinsic macroscopically distinguishable two- or three-dimensionally linked interfacial polymer phases, such as multilayered structures that impart their specific properties to the composite device as intended by the specific application for the device. It is understood that each type of polymer network can affect the mechanical and surface properties of the polymer mixture and impart a range of desired properties for the desired application for the device.
[0042] The polyphosphazene coating can be applied by any number of techniques. In one aspect, for example, the polyphosphazene of the present invention can be applied to the silicone by dipping the silicone in a solution of the polyphosphazene. Thus, solvent evaporation rates, concentration, type of solvent, the specific polyphosphazene, polyphosphazene concentration regime, the specific silicone used, the solvent susceptibility of the substrate material, silicone substrate structure, dip-coating parameters (temperature, dip-coating speed, dwell time in the solution, and the like), and other such parameters can be used to create highly homogeneous and/or tailored polyphosphazene coatings with the desired thickness and morphology on the specific substrate. A variety of solvents are suitable for the preparation of the polyphosphazene solution including, for example, polar aprotic solvents. In another aspect, polar protic solvents that show some solubility in or miscibility with water will also work well. For example, suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, pentyl acetate, hexyl acetate, heptyl acetate, octyl acetate, acetone, methylethylketone, methylpropylketone, methylisobutylketone, tetrahydrofuran, cyclohexanone, diglyme, t-butyl methyl ether, dimethyl ether, hexafluorobenzene, tetramethyl urea, tetramethyl guanidine, dimethyl acetamide, and the like, including any combinations thereof. Mixtures of these solvents can be used, or any solvent can be supplemented with the addition of other solvents or nonsolvents, such as ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, toluene, benzene, xylene(s), mesitylene, diethyl ether, water and the like. Further, other components can be added to the polyphosphazene solution, examples of which include, but are not limited to, co-solvents to adjust solubility, surfactants, adhesion agents, and the like, including any combination thereof.
[0043] In another aspect, alternatively, the polyphosphazene of the present invention can be applied to the silicone by spraying the polyphosphazene onto the silicone. For example, the polyphosphazene can be deposited on the substrate by a spray coating procedure. This method is especially suited for coating irregularly shaped articles. A solution of polyphosphazene in an organic solvent can be nebulized through a pneumatic nozzle employing an inert carrier gas at a specific pressure for breaking up the liquid feed. Alternatively, the nozzle can be a minimal pressure or a pressure-less ultrasonic type, generating a mist by breaking up the solution using ultrasonic agitation. The generated solution nebulas are targeted at the substrate to be coated and produce a conformal coating on the substrate of varying thickness depending on the exact conditions of the procedure. In yet another aspect, a supercritical solution of polyphosphazene in suitable solvents, such as carbon dioxide or dimethyl ether is created at a specific set of temperature and pressure parameters and spray coated onto the substrates in question.
[0044] A further aspect of this invention provides that the polyphosphazene can be co-extruded with the silicone during the manufacturing process for the silicone whereby the newly manufactured silicone is coated with the polyphosphazene. Alternatively, the polyphosphazene can be spin-coated onto the silicone. The spin-coating method is especially suited for forming very thin, homogeneous films on flat surfaces, where solutions of polyphosphazene polymers in suitable organic solvents can be spin-cast on the substrates in question. Solvent evaporation rates, concentration, type of solvent, the polyphosphazene concentration regime, and spin-coating parameters (temperature, spinning speed, and the like), and so forth can be used to create highly homogeneous and conformal polyphosphazene coatings with specified thickness and morphology on the silicone-containing substrate.
[0045] In still another aspect, a further procedure for coating the silicone with the polyphosphazene of the present invention is to electro-spin the polyphosphazene onto the silicone. Thus, any number of methods may be used, including spraying, dip-coating, electro-spraying, spin-coating, electro-spinning, and the like. Yet another procedure for coating the silicone with the polyphosphazene is to precipitate the polyphosphazene onto the silicone. One example of such a procedure is to volatilize the polyphosphazene in the presence of a gas atmosphere, either a reactive gas or an inert gas, in a vapor deposition procedure. Alternatively, the polyphosphazene can be applied to the silicone in a reduced gas atmosphere.
