[0013] Embodiments of the invention relate to a device and method that employ photo-induced charge separation and an electrical sensor detecting the charge separation. In the embodiments, the photo-induced charge separation is a reflection of specific chemical and/or biological interactions and is detected by the electrical sensors, which can be part of an integrated on-chip device for performing chemical analysis and medical diagnostics. In specific embodiments, the electrical sensor is a field effect transistor that detects photo-induced charge separations occur in materials involved in specific chemical or biological interactions.
[0014] The embodiments of the invention further relate to a device and method where an array of electrical sensors and corresponding molecular complexes are contained in a single substrate. Signals from the electrical sensor are detected and collected by circuitries on the substrate or in a separate device. One application of the electrical sensor array of the invention is their use in a protein or DNA array for simultaneous multiple protein or DNA analysis. The substrate of the embodiments of the invention may be part of an integrated device that also serves as a microarray or macroarray, an integrated circuit, a microfluidic device, a MEMS, or a combination. Therefore, samples contained or processed by the device may be also analyzed by the integrated device and the signals processed for analysis.
[0015] A biological sample often contains many thousands or even more types of biomolecules and clinical diagnosis needs to measure multiple analytes for disease confirmation. Currently, each analyte is measured separately, which requires multiple samples from a patient. The procedure is time consuming and labor intensive. Multiplex assays, in which multiple analytes can be measured at the same time, have been developed to solve this problem. However, in conventional multiplex assays, the detection of different types of labels, such as nanoparticles, are not effective due to signal strength and sensitivity.
[0016] Current photo detection devices are usually large in size and are difficult to be included in an integrated device. On the other hand, field effect transistors have the advantage of being small in size and easily integratable into a single device. But, due to problems related to signal intensity and sensitivity, FETs have drawbacks in serving as electrical sensors. Embodiments of the present invention combine the principles of photo-induced charge separation and field effect transistors as electrical sensors and achieve detection of analytes, especially bioanalytes, that is more specific and sensitive.
[0017] In the embodiments of the invention, analytes that can be detected include antigens of all types, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and small molecules coupled to a protein. The specific bindings between antigens and their corresponding antibodies form the basis of immunoassays. Antibodies suitable for the embodiments of the invention include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, recombinant antibodies, random peptides and aptamers. Immunoassays suitable for the embodiments of the invention include solid-phase immunoassays based the sandwich principle and the competing principle. Also included are specific types of immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL).
