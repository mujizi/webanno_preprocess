[0213] If an organic solvent, such as ethanol, is being used in the solution, another preferred method is to first dissolve the perfume in the organic solvent then add this perfume/solvent premix directly to an aqueous solution already containing the surfactant and buffer.
[0214] Another preferred method to incorporate maximum perfume into the present compositions with limited surfactant, is to create a premix in which perfume is added to a cyclodextrin mixture in aqueous media. Alternatively, the perfume-cyclodextrin mixture can be pre-formed prior to the premix. This approach ensures maximum perfume incorporation into the composition, and can incorporate perfume in compositions with little or no surfactant.
[0215] In certain cases, perfume solubilization at a relatively high level cannot be achieved, even with the preferred processing methods. However, in applications such as, but not limited to, counter and floor cleaners, the entire heterogeneous composition can be added directly to the article of use. Examples wherein this method of use is desirable include pre-moistened wipes, dry absorbent substrates used in conjunction with solution.
[0216] In cases where the surfactant active level does not limit perfume solubility in the compositions, a single step making process can be followed. For example, an acceptable order of addition is to first incorporate water, any optional detergent surfactant and/or organic acid, followed by any optional hydrophobic cleaning solvent. Once the solvent is added, pH is adjusted to optimum as desired by the formulator. The optional polymer can then be added followed by any optional peroxide, perfume and/or dye.
