[0071] As for packaging, the first and second sensor 114C and 114D can be attached to the filter housing 114A, but the filter 114B that filters the fluid can be replaceable without necessarily replacing the first and second sensors 114C, 114D depending on the particular embodiment. The sensors 114C, 114D can be designed to last the life of the filter unit 114, or be separately replaceable or replaceable with the filter 114B. In the latter case, it might be expedient to have the first and second sensor units 114C, 114D attached to or embedded in the filter 114B, such as shown in the exemplary filter unit 114' illustrated in FIG. 1G. In this regard, an appropriate interface, such as a waterproof plug, can be provided to couple the sensors 114C, 114D to the processing unit 112A.
[0072] In this way, the processing unit 112A is configured to generate an identifier to indicate a replacement condition for a filter 114B to be placed in the filter housing 114A based upon the comparison of the measurement data from the first and second sensor units 114C and 114D. An indicator 114E (e.g., a simple light, with or without a label, or an audible indicator) that indicates the replacement condition for the filter might be included as attached to or part of the filter housing 114A for instance, and/or the communication unit 112B might communicate the replacement condition to a remote communication device. Optionally, a display 114G can be provided for displaying information such as water quality measurements, date of last filter change, and/or remaining filter life (based on known loading specifications of the filter 1141B and measurement data obtained by the sensors 114C and 114D).
[0073] In still other variations, a third sensor unit 114F configured to be exposed to the fluid that enters the filter housing 114A can be employed, wherein the third sensor 114F is coupled to the processing unit 112A. The processing unit 112A would be in this embodiment configured to operate in conjunction with the first sensor 114C to monitor the fluid, generate a variable based on said monitoring, generate a preliminary identifier if the variable is indicative of a detection condition, and operate in conjunction with the third sensor 114F to determine whether the detection condition has occurred based on new data. As explained above, this monitor and confirm function can be carried out with sensors 111 configured within the same sensor unit 110, but the raw data can be communicated to a central location for this processing, and the central location can then be instructed whether to carry out the confirmation function.
[0074] As with other embodiments, this embodiment can include a communication unit 112B configured to report the detection condition to a remote communication device if the processing unit 112A confirms that the detection condition has occurred, and/or provide raw data and/or processed data to a remote communication device. Additionally or alternatively, the processing unit 112 might be configured to generate a sensor alert identifier if the third sensor unit 114F provides a measurement reading that differs by a predetermined amount from a contemporaneous measurement reading of a same type provided by the first sensor unit 114C. This configuration might serve as an indication that the first sensor unit 114C may be faulty. The first sensor unit 114C could then be deactivated by the processing unit 112A.
[0075] As with other embodiments disclosed herein the first and second sensor units 114C and 114D can include an ion-selective sensing element capable of measuring an ion content, a chlorine sensing element capable of measuring a chlorine content and a conductivity sensing element capable of measuring electrical conductivity, for example. More generally, the sensors 114C and 114C can comprise at least one of an ion-selective sensing element, an amperometric sensing element, a potentiometric sensing element, a conductivity sensing element, a temperature sensing element, an oxidation-reduction potential sensing element, a chlorine sensing element, an oxygen sensing element, an immunosensor, a DNA probe and an optical sensor.
