[0080] The washing machine according to this embodiment may include a first nozzle 200 for spraying circulation water inwardly of the drum 30 along a rotation axis of the drum 30 in the longitudinal direction of the drum 30 and a second nozzle 210 for spraying the circulation water inwardly of the drum 30 in a spray direction different from the first nozzle 200, when the circulation water is supplied by the circulation unit 40.
[0081] That is, the washing machine according to this embodiment includes the second nozzle 210 for spraying the circulation water inwardly of the drum 30 in a spray direction different from the first nozzle 200 in addition to the first nozzle 200 for supplying the circulation water inwardly of the drum 30 in the longitudinal direction of the drum 30. According to this embodiment, therefore, it is possible to uniformly supply the circulation water inwardly of the drum 30, thereby improving washing or rinsing efficiency.
[0082] The first and second circulation nozzles 200 and 210 according to this embodiment may be directly mounted in the tub 20 in a manner similar to the previous embodiments. Preferably, the first and second circulation nozzles 200 and 210 are mounted adjacent to the opening of the tub 20. A method of directly mounting the first and second circulation nozzles 200 and 210 to the tub 20 will not be described, because this method is identical to the method of directly mounting the circulation nozzle 100 to the tub 20, which was previously described.
[0083] In this embodiment, meanwhile, the number of the circulation nozzles is two. When the circulation nozzles are directly mounted to the tub 20, both of the circulation nozzles may be located at one side of the upper part of the tub 20. Preferably, however, the two circulation nozzles are preferably mounted at the tub 20 such that the circulation nozzles are symmetrical to each other the middle of the upper part of the tub 20. That is, as shown in FIG. 7, the first nozzle 200 and the second nozzle 210 may be disposed at opposite sides from the middle of the upper part of the tub 20.
[0084] In this case, the circulation line 42, extending from the circulation unit 40, may diverge from a predetermined position above the tub 20. Although not shown in the drawing, a valve may be mounted at the diverging point of the circulation line 42 for selectively supplying the circulation water to the first circulation nozzle 200 or the second circulation nozzle 210 or supplying the circulation water to both the first circulation nozzle 200 and the second circulation nozzle 210.
