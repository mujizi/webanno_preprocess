[0013] In operation the needle bar is reciprocated so that the needles penetrate and insert loops of yarn in a backing material fed longitudinally beneath the needles. The loops of yarn are seized by loopers or hooks moving in timed relationship with the needles beneath the fabric. In most tufting machines with two rows of needles, there are front loopers which cooperate with the front needles and rear loopers which cooperate with the rear needles. In a loop pile machine, it may be possible to have two separate rows of loopers such as those illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,841,886 where loopers in the front hook bar cooperate with the front needles and loopers in the rear hook bar cooperate with rear needles. Similar looper constructions have been used in tufting machines with separate independently shiftable front and rear needle bars, so that there are specifically designated front loopers to cooperate with front needles and specifically designated rear loopers to cooperate with rear needles. To achieve maximum stitch density, and to minimize the possibility of tufting front and rear needles through the same penetrations of the backing fabric, it is desirable to offset the front loopers from the rear loopers by a half gauge unit.
[0014] The result of having loopers co-operable with only a given row of needles on a fine gauge tufting machine with two independently shiftable needle bars is that it is only possible to move a particular needle laterally by a multiple of the gauge of the needles on the relevant needle bar. Thus for a fairly common 0.20 inch (1/5.sup.th ) gauge row of needles with corresponding loopers set at 0.20 inch gauge, the needles must be shifted in increments of 0.20 inches. This is so even though in a staggered needle bar with two rows of 0.20 inch gauge needles the composite gauge of the staggered needle bar is 0.10 inch gauge. The necessity of shifting the rows of needles twice the gauge of the composite needle assembly results in patterns with less definition than could be obtained if it were possible to shift in increments of the composite gauge.
[0015] One effort to reduce the gauge of tufting has been to use smaller and more precise parts. Furthermore, in order to overcome the problem of double gauge shifting, U.S. Pat. No. 5,224,434 teaches a tufting machine with front loopers spaced equal to the composite gauge and rear loopers spaced equal to the composite gauge. Thus on a tufting machine with two rows of 0.20 inch gauge needles there would be a row of front loopers spaced at 0.10 inch gauge and a row of rear loopers spaced at 0.10 inch gauge. Although this allows the shifting of each row of needles in increments equal to the composite gauge, this solution was limited in that the front needles can only be used to create loop pile and the rear needles can only be used to create cut pile.
[0016] Taking the arrangement of staggered needle bars shiftable at a composite gauge, and threading front needles with A and B yarns and rear needles with C and D yarns to form a repeat, a high volume of tufted fabric with selectively placed colored yarns can be manufactured with minimal wasted yarn used in the back stitching. This is because it is only necessary to shift each row of needles by a single lateral step in order to place all four A, B, C and D yarns in the desired location as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,240,263. A principal disadvantage to this tufting arrangement and operation is the requirement for the use of twice as many needles and twice as many single end yarn drives as would be the case with slower and less efficient tufting arrangements for the selective placement of individual yarns. Accordingly, improved methods of tufting machine operation to accomplish yarn color placement are still needed.
