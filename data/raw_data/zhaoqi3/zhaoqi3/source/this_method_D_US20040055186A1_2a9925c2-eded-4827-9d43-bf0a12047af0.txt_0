[0002] 1. Field of the Invention:
[0003] The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for smoothing items of clothing.
[0004] Numerous methods and apparatuses for smoothing items of clothing exist. For example, it is known to press the fabric of the item of clothing to be smoothed by pressure with a flat object. The prior art irons or ironing presses may be used for such a purpose. In addition, for smoothing sensitive items of clothing, in particular, it is known to subject them to heat and steam, whereby the fibers of an item of clothing are made to relax and, as such, the creases can be eliminated. An apparatus for applying this method is known, for example, from German Published, Non-Prosecuted Patent Application DE 3119560. However, this smoothing method disadvantageously has only a very slight smoothing effect because the fibers of the item of clothing are only made to relax and are not necessarily smoothed. In addition, the fibers of an item of clothing may become so permanently creased over time that the crease is impressed in the fiber structure such that, without being subjected to external mechanical action, the fiber in the relaxed state tends to assume the creased state. In such a case, without mechanical action, a smoothing method can achieve a smoothing effect only with the aid of steam and heat.
[0005] It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus for smoothing items of clothing that overcome the hereinafore-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and that achieves an improved smoothing effect while gently treating the item of clothing to be smoothed.
[0006] With the foregoing and other objects in view, there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a method for smoothing items of clothing, including the steps of providing an item of clothing, providing at least one gas jet for supplying a stream of a gas, and subjecting the clothing item at least in one portion to the at least one gas jet in a direction not parallel to the one portion.
