[0060] The washing machine W5 of this embodiment may include an input device 65 that may determine a point of time for transmitting upload operational data to the washing machine W5 from an external device 70. As shown in FIG. 12, the input device 65 may be a button type or various other type input devices produced with the development of technology, such as a touch screen and a voice recognizer. When an upload command (in FIG. 12, the operation of, for example, pressing an input button of the input device 65) is input into the input device 65, an electric signal may be applied to the controller 50 to start the transmission of upload operational data.
[0061] Hereinafter, how upload operational data is transmitted to the washing machine upon inputting of an upload command by the input device will be described with reference to FIG. 13. First, the external device 70 may be connected to the washing machine W5, in step S410. Afterwards, the controller 50 may check if an upload command is input into the input device, in step S420. Since an electric signal may be transmitted to the controller 50 from the input device 65 when an upload command is input into the input device 65, this step may be easily carried out by the controller 50 by sensing the presence or not of an electric signal. Afterwards, when the controller 50 confirms the inputting of an upload command, the controller 50 may detect at least part of the upload operational data stored in the external device 70, in step S430. Thereafter, the controller 50 may transmit and store the detected part of the upload operational data in the internal storage device 55. Afterwards, the controller 50 may check if all of the upload operational data has been transmitted, in step S450. If all of the upload operational data has not been transmitted, the controller 50 may repetitively perform the operation of detecting upload operational data from the external device 70 and transmitting the same, thus storing all of the upload operational data in the internal storage device. In the case that the operational data is to be replaced with the upload operational data, if this operation fails, controlling is done as illustrated in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5.
[0062] In this embodiment, an input device is used to determine the point of time for transmitting upload operational data from the external device to the washing machine, because if the transmission of the upload operational data is stopped due to imprecise coupling of the external device, operational data of the washing machine may be damaged and upload operational data for replacing the operational data may not be completely transmitted. This may make the washing machine inoperable. Accordingly, to solve this problem, the input device that determines the transmission or not of upload operational data after the precise coupling of the external device may be employed.
[0063] Hereinafter, a washing machine in accordance with another embodiment will be described with reference to FIG. 14. The components and operation of the washing machine according to this embodiment may be identical to those of the embodiment of FIGS. 12-13, except that an input device that determines the point of time for transmitting upload operational data to the washing machine and storing the same may provide in the slot in the washing machine. Thus, descriptions overlapping with the washing machine in accordance with the embodiment of FIGS. 12-13 will be omitted.
[0064] As described above, an input device 165 of this embodiment may be provided in a slot 160, and may be in the form of a button provided in the slot 160. When the external device 70 is precisely coupled to the slot, an upload command may be input by the input device 165 as the input device 65 is pressed by insertion of the external device 170 into the slot 160. Thus, a switch may be turned on by the pressure on the input device 165, and accordingly, an electric signal applied to the controller 50 and upload operational data transmitted from the external device 70. In the case that the operational data is to be replaced with the upload operational data, if this operation fails, controlling may be done as illustrated in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5.
