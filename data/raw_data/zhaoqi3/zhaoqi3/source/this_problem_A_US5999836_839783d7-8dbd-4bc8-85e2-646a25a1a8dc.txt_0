We need not be limited to using acoustic transducer arrays as sources and receivers as is now widely practiced in medical ultrasound imaging. An acoustic lens assembly or unit can be used with a transducer to scan the breast in a raster mode with a collimated (focused) acoustic beam (a method which we described previously using optical radiation sources). Also see Christensen, et al., An Introduction to the Physics of Diagnostic Radiology, p. 249-267 (1978). It is also possible to scan the breast with a number of focused acoustic beams either by using a combination of multiple sources with multiple lens units or a collimated acoustic source with a mask (in a manner similar to the corresponding optical technique shown in FIG. 2). This acoustic raster scan technique can also be implemented without an intersecting optical radiation field. A collimated acoustic receiver (which can also be a source) can be used to detect the exiting acoustic radiation field. Another approach which we have already described is to use a laser beam of appropriate wavelength to detect the effects of the acoustic field by various vibrometry techniques such as scanning (or by using holographic imaging) the breast surface or a surface coupled to the breast surface. These acoustic data acquisition techniques are now widely used in industry. Two such methods are C-mode and Scanning Laser Acoustic Microscopy, also referred to as C-SAM and SLAM, and laser vibrometry. See L. Santangelo, et al., Surface Mount Technology (September 1989); and Proceedings, SPIE vol. 2358 Conference on Vibration Measurements by Laser Techniques: Advances and Applications (1994). A compression plate can be modified to include a readout surface similar to the deformable mirrored deflection plate used with SLAM systems. As we is also previously described, the open compression plate in conjunction with a deformable mirrored deflection plate, an elastic mirrored layer or surface, a layer, sheet, or surface which is acoustically transmissive, a sheet, layer, or surface of material which functions as an acoustic source or detector (a piezoelectric material), or an insertable bladder mechanism function as bladder.
FIG. 19 shows two shaped compression plates with openings which have been modified to function as bladders for imaging and tissue characterization. The lower bladder employs an optical readout while the upper bladder incorporates an acoustically-transmissive layer which couples the transducer to the breast while presenting a smooth surface to the transducer. Here the transducer could operate as both a source and a receiver. A variation on this idea is to have both bladders provide source-receiver capabilities. It is also possible to work with a single bladder unit. An alternative design is to configure the source unit and the readout unit as bladder modules which would simply be inserted into the open compression plates. The bladder modules would be attached directly to the compression plates or an external force (such as a mechanical arm, a human hand, liquid or air pressure, gravity, etc.) would be used to press the elastic acoustically-transmissive layer of the bladder module against the breast surface and thus ensure good coupling of radiation into or out of the breast.
FIG. 20 shows a bladder device inserted into the opening of a shaped compression plate. The deformable layer or surface can be particularly useful when placed at locations on the breast surface where the boundaries have steep slopes such that the breast surface in the opening of the compression plate(s) presented depressions instead of being relatively uniform. We have discussed this problem earlier with respect to TOF applications where the use of a coupling liquid or gel was proposed to ensure that the scanned beam of optical pulses required approximately the same travel time when scanning a surface with an irregular geometry. The elastic layer and any coupling fluid or gel it contains can extend the breast volume, reducing problems caused by radiation reflecting from a skin-air interface. Offering a bladder module as an option may be more cost effective for users who only require compression plates for breast imaging.
In general, acoustic transmission and backscatter compression data can be acquired as well as acoustooptic compression data. Thus, acoustic, optic, and acousto-optic information can be acquired and evaluated independently and also compared to form a more complete characterization of the breast tissue being imaged. The use of compression with ultrasound will improve the efficacy of ultrasound mammography imaging. The region being scanned tends to be of a more uniform thickness and the typical penetration depth for ultrasound radiation used in mammography is now more appropriate for the thickness of tissue (making transmission ultrasound mammography a viable imaging technique).
Just as optical tomosynthesis is possible from multiple collimated (focused) angled optical (radiation) beams, so acoustical tomosynthesis (synthetic aperture imaging) is possible from multiple collimated (focused) angled acoustic beams. The collimated acoustic beams can be electronically or mechanically scanned through a range of angles and the acoustic source (and receiver) can be scanned or translated in the same manner as the optical source (and receiver). Several acoustic sources may be used together to set up complex propagating wavefronts, standing wavefront patterns, or compensated wavefronts (such as time reversal mirrors) which could improve imaging and tissue identification. See SPIE vol. 1733 (F. Lizzi, ed., 1992). In addition, virtual collimated (focused) acoustic radiation beams can be measured along with the transmitted and/or backscattered collimated acoustic beams with the aid of additional collimated (acoustic lens, physical separation, electronic beam forming, TOF, acoustic holography) acoustic receivers. A variety of acoustic waveforms can be employed and acoustic source requirements may range from CW to pulsed. Coherent acoustic imaging techniques which use TOF principles, beam forming (phased array), and synthetic aperture methods are commonly used in medical ultrasound, industrial acoustics, and underwater acoustics. See Modern Acoustical Imaging (H. Lee & G. Wade, eds. 1986). Synthetic aperture methods are also widely used in radar imaging. See D. Wehner, High Resolution Radar (1987); and M. Soumekh, Fourier Array Imaging (1994). Types of acoustic sources include single transducer probes, line arrays, two-dimensional arrays, focused tranducers, and focused tranducer arrays. Optoacoustic sources (such as pulsed, and possibly scanning, laser beams) can also be used if advantageous (although focusing may require beam forming or making use of a short pulse duration). Both static and dynamic (Doppler) acoustic imaging should benefit from the use of compression.
