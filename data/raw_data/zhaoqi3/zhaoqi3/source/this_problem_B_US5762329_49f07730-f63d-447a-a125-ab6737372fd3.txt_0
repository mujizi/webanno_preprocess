After the storing operation has been completed, the stapler 52 disposed so as to be opposite to the stapling stage sequentially staples the sheets 22 stored in the sort-bin tray of all the sort-bin trays 50 which is situated at the stapling stage.
Even if the sheets 22 are already stored in the sort-bin trays 50 as a result of the preceding job, it is possible to continuously accept a copying operation of the next job in the present embodiment.
In a case where the sheets 22 stored in the sort-bin tray 50 have already been punched as a result of the preceding job, a postprocessing operation of the next job will be carried out if only the stapling operation is set as a postprocessing mode for the next job using the control panel 30 (i.e., the differently-punched sheets are stapled, exactly as they are). To prevent this problem, a priority processing mode which will be described later is adopted as a modification algorithm which will be described later in the present embodiment. For instance, sheets of the next job are automatically punched as well as stapled in the mode in which a stapling operation is prioritized. Further, an indication of execution of the punching operation appears on a display of the control panel 30.
(2) Construction of the Postprocessing Apparatus
The detailed construction of the postprocessing apparatus will now be described.
