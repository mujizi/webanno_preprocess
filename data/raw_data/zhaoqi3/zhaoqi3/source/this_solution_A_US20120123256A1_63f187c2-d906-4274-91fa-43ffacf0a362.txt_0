[0031] We also provide a method of thermoacoustic imaging of an object, wherein thermoacoustic signals representing a mechanical wave response to a delivery of electromagnetic energy to the object may be used for reconstructing an energy deposition image representing a local energy deposition within the object and wherein the reconstructing step includes a matrix-based optoacoustic inversion of the thermoacoustic signals utilizing a forward model matrix.
[0032] The matrix-based optoacoustic inversion representing the essential part of this method provides a novel semi-analytical model-based inversion method for quantitative thermoacoustic image reconstruction. In contrast to back projection-like algorithms, the method is not based on an analytical solution to the inverse problem. Instead, the forward problem is reformulated in matrix relation, which is subsequently inverted. Advantageously, thermoacoustic signal generation and propagation presents a linear forward problem, therefore this type of optimization problem has only one single minimum. In addition, the model matrix is sparse, thus enabling efficient inversion algorithms to be used. Ideally, the inversion can yield artifact-free quantified thermoacoustic image reconstructions. As a further advantage, many additional linear effects can be added to the model matrix, while using the same matrix-inversion algorithm. Thus, the forward model is highly flexible and can be used to model a variety of linear attenuation and dispersion effects, for example, by taking the frequency response and spatial response of the detector into account as well as acoustic coupling, dispersion and other propagation aspects.
[0033] The semi-analytical solution is exact for piecewise planar acoustic-source functions. Thus, the solution is exact for a planar interpolation of the acoustic-source functions. This significantly improves the accuracy and computational speed associated with the forward model. Using this solution, the model matrix can be constructed, connecting the measured acoustic signals with the thermoacoustic image. By inverting the matrix relation, the thermoacoustic image is recovered. The matrix elements depend only on the setup geometry, and thus can be calculated before the experiment is performed. The inversion of the matrix relation can also be preformed beforehand by calculating the pseudo-inverse of the matrix. Once the experiment is performed, the inversion amounts to multiplying the pre-calculated pseudo-inverse with a vector containing the measured data--a computation that can in principle be performed in real time. Numerical and experimental tests have shown that the reconstruction algorithm does not suffer from back projection-related reconstruction artifacts and renders an accurate high-resolution map of laser energy deposition in the imaged object.
[0034] Apparently, the matrix model-based approach has several advantages over back-projection algorithms. First, it eliminates image artifacts associated with the approximated back-projection formulations, i.e., no negative absorption values are produced and the reconstructed image corresponds to the true light attenuation and energy deposition within the object. Clearly, since back-projection falsely emphasizes edges and fast image variations by producing large negative overshoots, it is capable of producing `good looking` high-contrast images. However, due to its approximate formulation, it fails to reproduce the correct and quantitative image of the actual laser energy deposition in tissue and the underlining optical absorption values. This property is especially important for quantitative imaging applications, i.e., molecular imaging studies, in which obtaining the correct absorption maps is of high importance. Second, the method admits generalization of the forward solution to a more comprehensive acoustic propagation models without changing the inversion procedure. Finally and importantly, the model-based inversion can be seamlessly adapted to any detection geometry. Unlike in the conventional analytical inversion formulation, the position of the detectors is not restricted to specific geometries.
[0035] We provide an imaging device for thermoacoustic imaging of an object comprising a signal collecting device, a reconstruction device, and a decomposition device. The imaging device in particular is configured for implementing one of the methods of the above first and seconds aspects. The signal collecting device is an apparatus which is configured for collecting thermoacoustic signals in response to a delivery of electromagnetic energy into the imaged object. The signal collecting device is connected with the reconstruction device, which is arranged for processing the thermoacoustic signals. The reconstruction device is adapted for reconstructing an energy deposition image representing a local energy deposition within the object based on collected thermoacoustic signals. For implementing the above second method described above, the reconstruction device preferably comprises an inversion circuit being adapted for subjecting the thermoacoustic signals to a matrix-based optoacoustic inversion utilizing an inverted model matrix. Furthermore, the reconstruction device is connected with the decomposition device, which is adapted for decomposing the energy deposition image into a quantitative absorption image representing a distribution of a local absorption coefficient in the object and at least one further image component.
