[0377] Any of the aforementioned peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, or dicumyl peroxide are imbibed into the polymer such as polyurethane by dipping the polymer into a peroxide solution in an organic solvent for a predetermined period of time and dried. The peroxide containing polymer is put into a solution of monomer. The redox polymerization is initiated by the addition of a reducing agent, for example salts of Fe(II), such as Fe(II) chloride, Fe(II) sulfate, ammonium Fe(II) sulfate, or Fe(II) gluconate, at room temperature or elevated temperature, to the monomer solution.
[0378] For modifying the surface of an article and/or surface graft polymerization, it has been found particularly useful to use hydrophobic-hydrophilic redox initiator pairs. For example, in one embodiment the hydrophobic member of a hydrophobic-hydrophilic redox initiator pair is incorporated into a hydrophobic substrate as previously described. The substrate surface is then treated with an aqueous polymerization mixture containing monomers, typically hydrophilic monomers, and the hydrophilic member of the redox pair. This method offers particular advantages when polymers are being grafted from components having exposed external and internal surfaces to be modified (such as catheters) and any substrate that cannot readily be exposed to light. Additionally, such a system tends to minimize the extent of non graft polymerization in the bulk polymerization mixture away from the polymerization mixture/substrate surface interface.
