More particularly and with specific reference to FIG. 1, body 47 of lamination 41 has a pair of radially spaced outer and inner peripheral edges 57, 59 with the inner peripheral edge defining a generally centrally located shaft receiving bore or the like through the body, as discussed hereinafter. A plurality of openings, such as generally V-shaped apertures or slots 61 for instance, are provided through body 47 between peripheral edges 57,59 thereof, respectively, and the openings are arranged with each other in generally arcuate spaced relation about the body. Thus, pole sections 49 respectively are defined on body 47 generally between adjacent ones of openings 61.
Each of openings 61 has a pair of leg parts 63,65 tapering toward each other generally in a direction from outer peripheral edge 57 toward inner peripheral edge 59. Leg parts 63, 65 each have a pair of opposite side edges 67,69 and 71,73 and a pair of end edges or end portions 75,77 are interposed between the side edges generally adjacent outer peripheral edge 57 while a common end edge or end portion 79 is interposed between side edges 67,73 generally adjacent inner peripheral edge 59. Thus, side edges 67,73 of leg parts 63,65 are provided on adjacent ones of pole sections, 49, and side edges 69,71 are provided on pole sections 53 between the adjacent ones of pole sections 49, respectively. Further, bridging means or inner bridges 51 are defined between inner peripheral edge 59 and common end edge 79 so as to integrally interconnect between pole sections 49, and sets or pairs of bridging means or outer bridges 55 are arranged between outer peripheral edge 57 and each end edge 75,77 of leg parts 63,65 in openings 61 so as to define narrow peripheral bands or strips on body 47 which may be deformed generally radially inwardly toward the leg parts, respectively, as discussed in detail hereinafter. Thus, bridges or bridge pairs 55 are integrally interconnected between each pole section 53 and the pole sections 49 adjacent thereto, respectively. Pole sections 53 are defined generally between side edges 69,71 of leg parts 63,65 in openings 61 and extend therebetween generally radially inwardly from outer peripheral edge 57 toward inner peripheral edge 59. The radially inner ends of side edges 69,71 intersect with a free end edge 81 on pole section 53 which is arranged generally in opposite or facing relation with common end edge 79, and a pair of opposite tabs or abutments 83,85 integrally formed on each of pole sections 53 extend generally from the opposite side edges of the pole section at least generally adjacent the free end edge into leg parts 63,65 of openings 61, respectively. While openings 61 are described herein as being generally V-shaped in lamination 41, it is contemplated that other openings having different shapes may be employed within the scope of the invention so as to meet the objects thereof, and of course, such different shaped openings would also alter the shape of the pole sections.
Referring again in general to the drawings and recapitulating at least in part with respect to the foregoing, there is illustrated a method for making, manufacturing or assembling rotor 43 which has a plurality of discrete polar regions or areas, such as generally defined by pole sections 49,53, with such polar regions or pole sections being spaced apart generally about a peripheral portion 87 of the rotor (FIGS. 3-10). In this method, pole sections 53 are positioned, disposed or otherwise located or arranged in preselected positions spaced between adjacent ones of pole sections 49 (FIGS. 1 and 3), and a plurality of sets or pairs of magnetic material elements 89,91 are disposed or otherwise arranged between pole sections 53 and the adjacent ones of pole sections 49, respectively (FIGS. 4 and 5). A hardenable non-magnetic material 93 is provided in rotor 43 between pole sections 49,53 and magnetic material elements 89,91, so as to be solidified in place therebetween, and the non-magnetic material acts along with the magnetic material elements to effect magnetic polarity definition between pole sections 49,53 while also retaining or maintaining the magnetic material elements and pole sections 53 in their preselected positions against displacement, respectively (FIG. 6). Hardenable material 93 may be aluminum, copper or respective alloys thereof or other non-magnetic materials having good electrical conductivity properties.
More particularly and with specific reference to FIGS. 1-8 and 10, a plurality of laminations 41 are stacked or otherwise assembled together generally in juxtaposed or face-to-face relation, as illustrated generally in FIGS. 3 and 10, thereby to form a lamination stack 95 having a predetermined stack height or length required for rotor 43 of FIG. 10, and the stacking of the laminations is illustrated by functional diagram box 97 in FIG. 2. Either during or subsequent to the above discussed stacking or laminations 41 into rotor stack 95, openings 61 of the lamination are respectively aligned or otherwise arranged with each other so as to define a plurality of slots or slot openings 99 which extend through rotor 43 between a pair of opposite ends or end portions 101, 103 thereof, as best seen in FIGS. 3 and 10. Even though the alignment of openings 61 so as to form slots 99 may be accomplished during the stacking of laminations 41, as discussed above, such opening alignment is illustrated in a separate functional diagram box 105 of FIG. 2. Although slots 99 are shown as extending generally axially through rotor 43 between opposite ends 101, 103 thereof, it is contemplated that the slots may be slightly skewed during the alignment of openings 61 within the scope of the invention so as to meet at least some of the objects thereof. Further and albeit not shown for the sake of brevity, it is to be understood that suitable equipment may be employed to effect the stacking of laminations 41 and the alignment of openings 61 so as to form slots 99 through stator 43. Of course, it may also be noted that upon the above discussed alignment of openings 61, outer and inner peripheral edges 57, 59 of laminations 41 in stack 95 thereof are also generally aligned or otherwise arranged with each other so that outer peripheral edges 57 generally define peripheral portion or wall 87 on rotor 43 between opposite ends 101, 103 thereof and inner peripherial edges 59 generally define a shaft receiving bore 107 extending through the rotor between the opposite ends thereof, respectively, as best seen in FIG. 10. Of course, the particular edges on laminations 41 which define openings 61 therethrough, as discussed hereinabove, are also disposed generally in alignment with each other upon the alignment of the openings so as to form slots 99 in rotor stack 95, and such particular edges in their aligned formation define wall or wall means of the slot; however, for the sake of brevity, such slot walls will be designated by the reference numeral of such particular edges corresponding thereto when referred to hereinafter.
Magnetic material elements 89,91, such as elongate block or bar magnets for instance, are provided with a pair of opposite generally flat surfaces or faces 109, 111 interposed between a pair of opposite generally flat intermediate surfaces or end faces 113, 115, respectively. When openings 61 of laminations 41 are aligned through rotor stack 95 to define slots 99 thereof, as discussed above, magnets 89,91 are respectively inserted, placed, positioned or otherwise disposed within of the slots so that opposite faces 109,111 of the magnets are arranged generally in facing relation with opposite sidewalls 67,69 and 71, 73 of the slots extending through rotor stack 95, respectively, as shown in FIG. 4. In other words, opposite faces 109, 111 of magnets 89,91 extend generally in face-to-face relation with pole sections 49,53 generally throughout their lengths with respect to slots 99 between opposite end faces 101, 103 of rotor stack 95. Of course, due to manufacturing tolerances for both lamination 43 and magnets 89, 91, it is contemplated that the magnets may be generally loosely positioned in slots 99. Upon the placement of magnets 89,91 within slots 99, opposite intermediate surfaces 115 of the magnets may be seated or otherwise located on opposite tabs 83,85 of pole sections 53 so that the other opposite intermediate surface 113 of the magnets are spaced from outer bridges or bridge sections 55 in rotor stack 95. Magnets 89,91 are available from TDK Electronics Co., Ltd., 2-14-6, Uchikanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan under Model No. TDK-30 and generally have the magnetic characteristics as illustrated in the graph of FIG. 12. The placement of magnets 89,91 in slots 99 is illustrated in functional diagram box 117 in FIG. 2. While the particular shape and magnetic characteristics of magnets 89,91 are disclosed herein, it is contemplated that other magnets having other shapes and/or other magnetic characteristics may be employed in rotor 43 within the scope of the invention so as to meet the objects thereof, and it is also contemplated that more than two magnets may be utilized in the definition of a polar region of the rotor within the scope of the invention so as to meet the objects thereof. For the sake of comparison, the magnetic characteristics of some of the above mentioned other magnets which might be employed in rotor 43 are also shown in the graph of FIG. 12.
