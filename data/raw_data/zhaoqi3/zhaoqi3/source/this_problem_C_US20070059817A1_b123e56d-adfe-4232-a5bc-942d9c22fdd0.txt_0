[0008] DNA micro-arrays adapted to utilize a hybridization reaction are expected to find applications in the field of medical diagnosis for identifying specific pathogenic microbes and gene diagnosis for examining bodily constitutions of patients. However, as a matter of fact, the step of amplification of the nucleic acid, that of hybridization and that of detection of the target nucleic acid as listed above are conducted normally individually by means of respective apparatus and involve cumbersome operations to make the diagnosis considerably time consuming. Particularly, when the hybridization reaction is made to take place on a glass slide, the probe can become missing or contaminated when the operator touches the glass slide with a fingertip because the probe-immobilizing region is exposed. Therefore, the operator is required to handle the probe very carefully. To avoid these and other problems, there have been proposed several biochemical reaction cassettes having a structure adapted to arrange a DNA micro-array in a reaction chamber, make a hybridization reaction to take place in the reaction chamber and conduct the subsequent detection step also in the reaction chamber.
[0009] FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate such a biochemical reaction cassette. FIG. 8 is a cross sectional view of the biochemical reaction cassette of FIG. 7 taken along a plane parallel to the vertical direction that includes the injection port and the discharge port. Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, the biochemical reaction cassette 51 comprises a housing 52 and a glass substrate 53 to which a DNA probe that is to specifically bind to a target nucleic acid is immobilized. The housing 52 is provided with a dent section (recess) and part of the recess forms a reaction chamber 54 having a bottom surface where the DNA probe is immobilized as the housing 52 and the glass substrate 53 are bonded to each other. An injection flow channel 55 and a discharge flow channel 56 are connected to the reaction chamber 54 so that the liquid specimen to be analyzed and one or more than one reagents may be injected and discharged.
[0010] The reaction chamber 54 of the biochemical reaction cassette 51 as illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8 has only a small volume of tens of several microliters and bubbles are apt to remain in the reaction chamber 54 after filling it with liquid due to its structure. The biochemical reaction can be blocked and the diagnosis can be adversely affected when bubbles remain in the region where the DNA probe is immobilized to the glass substrate 53. The operation of precisely controlling the movement of liquid so that bubble may not remain in the reaction chamber 54 is a cumbersome one and additionally such bubbles can form an obstacle when the biochemical reaction cassette is applied to an automatic diagnostic apparatus. To avoid this problem, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-302399 discloses an arrangement where the reaction chamber is provided on the upper or lower surface thereof with a hydrophobic region and a hydrophilic region. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-093558 discloses an arrangement for preventing bubbles from being produced by means of a flow channel formed by using a protruding member in an upper part of the reaction region. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-243748 discloses an arrangement for forming a uniformly spreading flow of liquid by means of a butterfly structure or a cascade structure.
[0011] The arrangement of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-302399 and that of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-093558, however, cannot completely eliminate bubbles remaining at and near the outlet port. Similarly, with the arrangement of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-243748, bubbles may be left in an upper part of the reaction chamber because the outlet port is connected to an end of the chamber. When bubbles are left at and near the outlet port, they can grow in the hybridization step to cover the DNA probe-immobilizing region because of the temperature rise in that step. Then, the biochemical reaction can be blocked to adversely affect the diagnosis.
[0012] Additionally, the arrangements of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-302399, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-093558 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-243748 require the cassette to be surface-treated and involve a complex profile for the reaction chamber to consequently raise the cost of manufacturing the cassettes.
