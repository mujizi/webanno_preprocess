[0199] As shown in FIG. 16 and the detail of FIG. 18, waste fluid is washed away from the sample flow path and redirected into waste chamber 201 by a flow diverter 174. The flow diverters 174, 175 may comprise a capillary or hydrophobic membrane to allow fluid to pass when a threshold back pressure develops in the regions before the diverters. The waste fluid filling waste chamber 201 creates pressure in region 176. Once the waste chamber 201 is filled with fluid, the pressure in region 176 triggers the diverter 174 to allow fluid to pass. Simultaneously, the sample in lysing chamber 173 is heated by heater 193 causing the nucleic acid to be released from the filter paper 183 and flow out through outlet D.
[0200] The sample flows along the sample flow path through diverter 174 and into chip 177 where target analyte is extracted. Waste components flowing from the chip 177 are redirected by flow diverter 175 to flow into a second waste chamber 203. Waste components collecting in the second waste chamber 203 create back pressure in region 178. Once waste components fill the second waste chamber 203, the pressure in region 178 is sufficient to release diverter 175 and allow fluid to pass. Simultaneously, a voltage or heat is applied to the chip 177 through connectors in the flex circuit 167, releasing the target analyte. Thereby, the analyte flows down the elution flow path and into a reagent chamber 179 where predried reagents are reconstituted and mixed with the analyte. The mixture continues to flow into and fill the reaction chamber 181. The elution flow path ends at reaction chamber 181 where amplification, e.g. PCR, takes place.
[0201] Historically, the lysis step in sample processing has been a time consuming and difficult task, especially for spores and certain cell structures. In further embodiments, the present invention addresses this problem by providing a method and device for the rapid lysing of sample components, e.g., cells, spores, or microorganisms, using ultrasound. The ultrasonic lysing may be performed in a fully integrated cartridge, such as the cartridge of FIG. 2, or may be performed with a cartridge that performs only lysing of sample components.
[0202] FIG. 19 shows an exemplary device for lysing sample components, e.g., cells, spores, or microorganisms. The device includes a cartridge 70 having an inlet port 72 for introducing the sample into the cartridge, and a lysing chamber 74 in fluid communication with the inlet port 72 for receiving the sample. The cartridge also includes an outlet port 76 for exit of the sample from the chamber 74.
[0203] The chamber 74 contains a solid phase for capturing the components of the sample to be lysed. Suitable solid phases for capturing cells, spores, or microorganisms include, e.g., filters, beads, fibers, membranes, glass wool, filter paper, polymers and gels. The solid phase may capture the desired sample components through physical retention, e.g., size exclusion, through affinity retention, or through chemical selection. In the presently preferred embodiment, the solid phase comprises a membrane or filter 86 for capturing the components to be lysed. Suitable filter materials include glass, fiberglass, nylon, nylon derivatives, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, and other polymers. In an alternative embodiment, the solid phase comprises polystyrene, silica, agarose, cellulose, or acrylamide beads.
