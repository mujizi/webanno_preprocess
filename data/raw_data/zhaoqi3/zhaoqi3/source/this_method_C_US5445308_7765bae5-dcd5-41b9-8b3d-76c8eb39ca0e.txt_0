Increased power consumption generates increased heat. Thermal expansion caused by heating up the components, however, is not uniform. Thermal expansion varies with temperature gradients and mismatches between coefficients of thermal expansion. Mechanical stresses result from these differences which contribute to the finite lifetime and failure rate of the components. Moreover, the components have limited temperature tolerance. For instance, integrated circuit chip temperatures must often be below 100.degree. C. to assure proper and reliable electrical performance. As a result, heat transfer and heat removal techniques have become critical.
An important aspect of heat conduction in microelectronic packages is the transfer of heat across the interface of two surfaces, for example an integrated circuit chip mounted on an electrical interconnect substrate. Generally, when two surfaces are pressed together the contact is imperfect and the actual heat transfer area of the joint is only a small fraction of the total area. This constriction and then spreading of the heat flux in the vicinity of the joint is manifested by a temperature drop at the interface, which results in increased thermal resistance.
Thermally conductive adhesives with dispersed solids have been devised for heat sink attachment of electrical components and for attachment of integrated circuit chips to substrates and other packaging structures. Silver filled epoxies and the like for electrical and thermal interface connections are well known. A primary goal is to provide both a dependable mechanical bond and a highly conductive path for heat flow. Although the basic theory of this method appears sound, in practice this method may have serious drawbacks. Since the thermal conductivity of such adhesives depends on the ability of the solids within the adhesives to contact each other and the surfaces to be joined, limited contact areas introduce constriction resistance and reduce the thermal conductance of the joint. Similar problems arise for electrically conductive adhesives resulting in reduced electrical conductance.
There has been some recent activity directed towards overcoming this primary shortcoming. A main thrust has been the use of low temperature solder (or fusable alloy) fillers with melting points (or melting ranges for non-eutectics) between approximately 40.degree. C. and 100.degree. C. A bond is formed by melting and resolidifying the metal. Tin, gold, solder and various alloys may be used.
Solder fillers can be liquid at the cure temperature of the adhesive thereby enhancing the surface contact and later solidify at room temperature. Such solder fillers include tin-bismuth based solders (e.g., 52/30/18 Bi/Pb/Sn) and indium-based solders (e.g., 95/5 Ga/In, 66.3/33.7 In/Bi). For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,896 by Wu-Song Huang discloses a paste which contains a meltable alloy (solders of the Bi/Sn, Bi/Sn/Pb, and Pb/Sn systems) in a solution of a polymer dissolved in a solvent such as NMP with a transient fluxing agent and an optional surfactant. Solder reflow occurs at a temperature in the range of approximately 160.degree. C. to 250.degree. C. The fluxing agent is driven off primarily as vapor during reflow and the surfactant if present is likewise driven off as a gaseous by-product of the process. The joint appears to contain a solid solder connection throughout its operation.
