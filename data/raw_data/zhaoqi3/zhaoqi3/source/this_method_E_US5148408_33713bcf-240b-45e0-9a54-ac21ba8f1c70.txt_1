Referring first to FIG. 1, a schematic of a drillstring utilizing an acoustic telemetry system such as the type described in U.S. Ser. No. 605,255 is shown. In FIG. 1, a drilling rig 10 is positioned on the surface 12 above a borehole 14 which is traversed by a drillstring 16. Drillstring 16 is assembled from sections of drill pipe 18 that are connected end-to-end by tool joints 20. It will be appreciated that additional sections of drill pipe 18 are added to the uphole end of drillstring 16 as the hole deepens. The downhole end of the drillstring includes a drill collar 22 composed of drill collar pipe having a diameter which is relatively larger than the diameter of the drill pipe sections 18. Drill collar section 22 includes a bottom hole assembly which terminates at drill bit 24 and which may include several drill collar sections housing downhole sensors for sensing parameters such as pressure, position or temperature. In accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, one of the drill collar sections includes an acoustic transmitter/receiver pair 26 which communicates with an acoustic transmitter/receiver 28 uphole of drillstring 16 by the transmission (and receipt) of acoustic signals through the drillstring. Acoustic transmitter/receiver 26 and 28 are preferably of the type disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 605,255, which has been fully incorporated herein by reference.
Acoustic transmitter 26 transmits acoustic signals which travel along drillstring 16 at the local velocity of sound, that is, about 16,000 feet per second if the waves are longitudinal and 10,000 feet per second if they are torsional. As shown in FIG. 2, the initial characteristic of a signal received by receiver 28 which has been transmitted by acoustic transmitter 26 has a plurality of alternating passbands and stop-bands with respect to signal frequency. It will be appreciated that frequencies chosen by acoustic transmitter 26 should be those with the lowest amount of attenuation within a passband. Unfortunately, the uniform low attenuation characteristic of the passbands of FIG. 2 do not persist with time. Instead, interfering signals resulting from reflections (ecohes) of the original transmitted signal create what is termed attenuation "fine structure" shown in FIG. 3. FIG. 3 depicts the attenuation characteristics of the received signal subsequent to interference by signal reflection; the "fine structure". In order to optimize transmission through such fine structure attenuation, transmission frequencies must be carefully selected. Of course, the frequency choice is thereby limited and difficult to achieve. Moreover, optimum frequency choice becomes even more difficult because the fine structure changes each time a new drill pipe 18 is added.
In accordance with the present invention, the optimum frequencies for communicating between the downhole acoustic transmitter 26 and the uphole receiver 28 are determined by an adaptive communication scheme wherein one transmitter/receiver pair (e.g. uphole pair 28) transmits different frequencies along drillstring 16 to the transmitter/receiver at the other end of the drillstring (e.g. downhole pair 26) while the receiver monitors the transmitted message. Upon receipt of a series of transmitted signals by the opposite end receiver, then the optimum frequencies may be determined for that particular drillstring geometry. At that point, the downhole transmitter/receiver pair 26 transmits data signals (based on information received by known measurement-while-drilling downhole sensors) using the optimum frequencies along drillstring 16 to the top transmitter/receiver pair 28. This method of using one transmitter/receiver pair to determine the optimum frequencies for transmitting downhole information is repeated throughout the drilling process as additional drill pipe sections 18 are added and as other parameters of drillstring 16 change. As a result, the present invention provides an adaptive method of continuously optimizing the transmission frequencies in the passbands (as shown in FIG. 2). Moreover, the present invention will be able to select the low attenuation transmission frequencies despite the presence of reflected signals which will cause the interference exhibited by the fine structure of FIG. 3. It will be appreciated that in this latter case, the optimum frequencies will be those frequencies which coincide with the tip of the "fingers" exhibited by the fine structure in a particular passband region.
It has been determined that the optimum frequencies for acoustic transmission along a drill pipe may change along the length of the drill pipe as a result of the differing pipe segments 18 in joints 20. In accordance with an alternative method of the present invention, rather than using only a single transmitter/receiver pair 26 at or near the bottom of drillstring 16, a plurality of transmitter/receiver pairs are located along the length of the drillstring at predetermined intervals with each adjacent transmitter receiver pair being in communication with another so that the optimized frequencies in a localized section of drillstring may be found. Each of these spaced transmitters/receivers pairs will be located at joints 20 along the length of the drillstring 16 selected by transmission criteria such as signal to noise ratio and data rate capacity.
As is clear from a review of FIGS. 2 and 3, acoustic transmission of data signals may be provided by a plurality of communications channels which result from the presence of the plurality of passbands. In still another embodiment, the present invention may take advantage of this phenomenon by employing the transmission of multiple optimized channels simultaneously. It will of course be appreciated that if several optimized data communications channels are thereby provided, the rate of data communication may be increased dramatically. The data transmitted in such optimized data channels may be encoded as FM, FSK, PSK or by any other appropriate technique given the optimized frequency characteristics of each channel.
