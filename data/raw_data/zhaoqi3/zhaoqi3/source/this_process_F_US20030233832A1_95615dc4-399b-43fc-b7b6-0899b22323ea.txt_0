[0043] FIG. 6 shows the aft end portion of the combustion chamber 13 and the end of venturi 11 that includes the blocking ring 40 that is annular and disposed and attached in a sealing manner around the entire aft portion of the venturi 11. The cooling air that enters into passageway 14 cannot escape or be allowed to pass into any portions of the combustion chamber 13. Note that some air is permitted into the combustor 10 well beyond combustion chamber 13 through apertures 30 to 31 which are disposed around the outside of the combustor 10 and for cooling the aft end of the combustor.
[0044] The invention includes the method of improved cooling of a combustion chamber and venturi which allows the air used for cooling to increase the efficiency of the combustion process itself to reduce NOx emissions. With regard to the air flow, the cooling air enters the venturi outer passageway 14 through multiple apertures 27. A predetermined amount of air is directed into the passageway 14 by element 17. The cooling air is forced upstream by blocking ring 40 which expands to contact the combustor 10 under thermal loading conditions. The cooling air travels upstream through the convergent/divergent sections of the first portion 45 of passageway 14 where it exits into the second portion 46 of passageway 14 through apertures 28 in the venturi 11 and the combustor 10. The cooling air then fills a chamber created by a full ring bellyband 16. Due to the pressure drop and increase in temperature that has occurred throughout the cooling path, supply air which is at an increased pressure is introduced into the bellyband chamber 16 through multiple holes 32. See FIGS. 4 and 5. The cooling air passes around multiple elements 18 which are located throughout the bellyband chamber 16 for support of the bellyband under pressure. The cooling air is then introduced to the premix chamber through holes 22 and slots 29 in the combustor 10. Undesired leakage does not occur between the cooling passageway 14 and the premixing chamber 12 because of the forward support 19 which is fixed to the combustor 10 and venturi 11. The remainder of the cooling air not introduced to passageway 14 through apertures 27 passes over the element 17 and travels upstream to be introduced into the combustor 10 or cap 15. This air is introduced through multiple locations forward of the bellyband cavity 16.
[0045] It is through this process, rerouting air that was used for cooling and supplying it for combustion, that lowers the fuel to air ratio such that NOx is reduced without creating an unstable flame.
[0046] Referring now to FIGS. 7-9, an alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown in detail. In this alternate embodiment, improvements have been made in the venturi throat region to enhance cooling effectiveness. As with the preferred embodiment and shown in FIG. 7, a venturi 60 is positioned within a liner 61 having a first generally annular wall 62. Liner 61 contains a premix chamber 63 for mixing fuel and air and a combustion chamber 64 proximate venturi 60 such that premixing chamber 63 is in fluid communication with combustion chamber 64. First generally annular wall 62 contains at least one first aperture 65 and at least one second aperture 66, radially outward of premix chamber 63. It is preferable that both first aperture 65 and second aperture 66 comprise a plurality of first and second apertures spaced circumferentially about wall 62.
[0047] Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 9, venturi 60 includes a second generally annular wall 67 having a first converging wall 68 abutting a first diverging wall 69 at a first plane 70 that is generally perpendicular to first generally annular wall 62. Venturi 60 further contains a throat portion 11A at first plane 70 such that throat portion 11A is positioned between premix chamber 63 and combustion chamber 64. Second generally annular wall 67 is positioned radially inward from first generally annular wall 62 and has an aft end 71 adjacent to at least one first aperture 65. Referring to FIG. 7, venturi 60 further includes a third generally annular wall 72 radially outward of second generally annular wall 67 and radially inward of first generally annular wall 62. Referring to FIG. 9, third generally annular wall 72 contains a second converging wall 73 and a second diverging wall 74 connected at a first region of curvature 75 proximate first plane 70 and having a first radius R1. In order to improve the cooling effectiveness along second generally annular wall 67 at throat region 11A, the geometry of third generally annular wall 72 proximate first region of curvature 75 changes to restrict the area for cooling flow through first portion 45 of passageway 14 proximate throat 11A. Second converging wall 73 contains a first convergent member 73A and a second convergent member 73B, and second diverging wall 74 contains a first divergent member 74A and a second divergent member 74B, such that second convergent member 73B and second divergent member 74B are located adjacent first region of curvature 75. Furthermore, first divergent member 74A is oriented at an angle .alpha..sub.1 relative to first plane 70, second divergent member 74B is oriented at an angle .alpha..sub.2 relative to first plane 70, first convergent member 73A is oriented at an angle .alpha..sub.3 relative to first plane 70, and second convergent member 73B is oriented at an angle .alpha..sub.4 relative to first plane 70. In order to form the restricted flow areas, the respective convergent and divergent members are oriented at angles such that .alpha..sub.2<.alpha..sub.1 and .alpha..sub.4<.alpha..sub.3, thereby forming a first region of reduced cross sectional area A1 between first diverging wall 69 and second divergent member 74B and a second region of reduced cross sectional area A2 between first converging wall 68 and second convergent member 73B. In the preferred configuration of this alternate embodiment, angles .alpha..sub.1 and .alpha..sub.3 are at least 40 degrees and angles .alpha..sub.2 and .alpha..sub.4 are equal such that, for optimum heat transfer along throat region 11A, first reduced cross sectional area A1 is substantially equal to second reduced cross sectional area A2.
