When using a semi-permeable membrane such as reverse osmosis (RO) or nanofiltration (NF) to purify water, the soluble inorganic ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, chloride, fluoride, carbonate, bicarbonate, sulfate and silica are separated by the membrane while the water is allowed to permeate or pass through the membrane. While RO separates all inorganic (and indeed organic) species, NF is somewhat "looser" than RO and has selectivity for separation of divalent and other multivalent ions such as carbonate, phosphate, silicate, sulfate, aluminum, barium, calcium, magnesium, strontium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver, tin, titanium, vanadium, zinc and other multivalent cations of the periodic table while allowing monovalent ions such as sodium, potassium, cesium, chloride, fluoride, nitrate and other monovalent ions to permeate through the membrane, and therefore it is typically used to remove "hardness" from the water (i.e. calcium, magnesium, silica, etc.). Typically, the water solubility of these hardness ions, when combined with certain monovalent, divalent or multivalent anions such as fluoride, carbonate, hydroxide, phosphate and sulfate (i.e. calcium fluoride, calcium or magnesium carbonate, calcium or magnesium silicate, calcium sulfate) is rather low when compared to compounds of monovalent cations such as sodium chloride, sodium carbonate or sodium sulfate. These compounds of multivalent cations are therefore termed "sparingly soluble compounds" and such term will be used extensively in the present invention.
As soluble and "sparingly soluble" ions are separated (or "rejected") by a semi-permeable membrane, the concentration of these compounds in solution increases and the osmotic pressure also increases. The solution must therefore be subjected to an operating pressure higher than the osmotic pressure of the solution in order to continue to permeate purified water through the membrane while the membrane retains, separates or rejects the soluble compounds (and indeed any water-borne insoluble suspended solids). The purified water (or permeate or "product") recovery is the fraction of the total "raw water" (or "influent water") flowrate that has been permeated through the membrane at the maximum membrane system's operating pressure. This recovery is normally limited by the osmotic pressure which is directly proportional to the concentrations of soluble compounds. Normally, spirally-wound low pressure or "brackish water" RO membranes are operated at pressures in the range 200-400 lb./sq. inch (psig), whereas spirally-wound "high pressure" or "seawater" RO membranes can be operated at upto 1200 psig. Plate and Frame or Disc-Type membranes can be operated at pressures of upto 3000 psig.
On the other hand, the purified water recovery is more frequently limited by formation of inorganic "crystalline" precipitate which deposits on the membrane as the concentration of sparingly soluble compounds (e.g. calcium fluoride, calcium carbonate, silica, etc.) exceeds their maximum solubility in the given solution at the operating temperature. Deposition of this "scale" on the surface of the membranes often leads to irreversible reduction or loss of permeation rate (or loss of permeate flux in gallons/sq. ft of membrane surface/day, gfd) and the need for costly replacement of the membranes. Frequently, the concentration of sparingly soluble compounds (i.e. hardness) in natural water sources such as lakes, rivers and aquifers and in industrial and landfill effluents is sufficiently high to limit the attainable recovery from RO or NF membranes to approximately 60%-80%. Since the TDS of such water sources is typically low, ranging from say 150-500 mg/L (ppm) in lakes and rivers to 500-1500 ppm in the case groundwater and brackish water aquifers, osmotic pressure is therefore not limiting. However, as the permeate recovery is increased beyond the range 60-80%, calcium carbonate, calcium fluoride, silica or other sparingly soluble compounds exceed their solubility and precipitate as scale on the membrane surface. The use of acids and anti-scalants such as polyacrylates, EDTA, SHMP, etc. will somewhat broaden the recovery range and improve cleanability of the membranes. However, as the concentration of anti-scalants is increased, they become ineffective, indeed they form insoluble compounds with the insoluble salts. The limited effectiveness of such chemical additives means that "the membrane reject stream volume" will be quite high, typically greater than 20-30% of the raw water volume treated, thereby representing a costly disposal problem in many cases. In other prior art (viz. U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,798), an attempt was made to increase the permeate recovery using a single-stage RO process followed by precipitation of scale from the RO concentrate and recycling of MF-treated concentrate after precipitation back to the RO to maximize the recovery. However, while this process represents a substantial improvement over prior art, it is not very economical and its maximum recovery is limited by build-up of hardness in the RO concentrate recycle stream which necessitates a large recycle via chemical precipitation and microfiltration to separate the precipitated solids. This results in high capital and operating costs of both the single-stage "high pressure" RO and the MF.
In the present invention, the limitations on the permeate recovery from a semi-permeable membrane (e.g. reverse osmosis, RO or nanofiltration, NF) which were experienced in prior processes are completely eliminated while simultaneously reducing the overall cost and rendering the high water recovery process economically viable. This is achieved by incorporating a two-stage membrane process in which the first stage achieves water purification of a large fraction of the water at a relatively low pressure and at a low cost, followed by a second stage operating at pressures as high as necessary (e.g. 500 psig-3000 psig) to overcome osmotic pressure and achieve the desired permeate recovery, depending on Influent water TDS. The relatively small second stage membrane concentrate is introduced into a suitable albeit high efficiency "softening means" such as a cation exchange resin or a chemical precipitation and filtration means to remove hardness followed by splitting and recycling of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate stream to the first membrane stage and second membrane stage using an appropriate ratio that would result in optimizing the recoveries of the two stages while minimizing the capital and operating costs of the integrated membrane process and maintaining good permeate quality.
Thus, for example, FIG. 1 provides a schematic illustrating the process of the invention which applies to the treatment of large flowrates of natural or industrial water streams containing inorganic contaminants with a low to moderate Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) concentration of 100-50000 mg/liter and more preferably 100-2000 mg/L and moderate to high hardness in the range 100-2000 mg/liter as CaCO3. In FIG. 1, the Raw Water or Influent 1 is introduced into a suitable Pretreatment Means 2 consisting of a clarifier or gravity settler with or without the use chemical coagulants and/or flocculants or alternatively by using an air flotation device to be followed by a single media or multi-media filtration device followed by a cartridge filter in the 5-10 micron particle separation range or alternatively the Influent 1 is pretreated by a suitable non-fouling ultrafiltration or microfiltration membrane such as but not limited totubular or hollow fibre membranes or any suitable combination of the above pretreatment means which will efficiently separate suspended solids and prevent premature fouling and "surface blinding" of the membranes downstream.
