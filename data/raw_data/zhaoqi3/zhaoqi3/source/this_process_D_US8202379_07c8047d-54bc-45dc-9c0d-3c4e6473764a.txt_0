There are many examples in both literature and patents of biopolymer solutions that are cast into molds to create a desired shape. In all of these cases, the biopolymer is completely dissolved so that the original structure is fully disrupted. With fiber welding, the fiber interior is intentionally left in its native state. This is potentially advantageous because the final structure retains some of the original material properties and is significant for creating materials from biopolymers such as silk and cellulose.
Traditional methods of cast molding biopolymer solutions are also disadvantaged in that there is a physical limit to how much polymer can be dissolved in solution. Typically, solutions that are 10% by mass biopolymer (90% by mass ionic liquid solvent) are generally quite viscous and difficult to handle, even at elevated temperatures. The fiber welding process allows (dry) fiber bundles to be manipulated into the desired shape before welding commences. The use and handling of native fibers often grants control over the engineering of the final product that is not possible for solution based technologies.
The invention is a process by which individual natural fibers such as cellulose, chitin, chitosan, collagen, hemicellulose, lignin, silk, et cetera, are swollen by an appropriate ionic liquid-based solvent system, and then reconstituted to form a congealed network. A cartoon of the fiber welding process is shown in FIG. 1. During welding, fiber bundles are swelled and mobilized by an appropriate ionic liquid-based solvent system, for example, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (+) acetate (-), abbreviated [EMI] [Ac], with molecular additives (not shown). Note that only the polymer at the outer surface need be sufficiently mobile to merge with that of neighboring fibers; material in the fiber core may be left in its native state. The depth of solvent penetration and the degree to which fibers are welded together is controlled by the nature (composition) and amount of solvent, temperature, pressure, spacing of the fibers, et cetera. Solvent removal leaves welded fibers. In addition to polymer movement, chemical derivatization may also be undertaken during this process. In general, the process increases the material density and decreases the surface area of a bundle of fibers. The mobilized fiber sheath may be modified with materials such as clay, carbon nanotubes, iron oxide, titanium dioxide, et cetera, to affect electronic, spectroscopic, thermal conductivity, magnetism, and antibacterial properties. In addition to regiospecific alteration of the physical properties, spatial control of chemical properties is also possible. Chemical properties (e.g., hydrophobicity, reactivity) at the fiber surface may be either similar to, or significantly different from the core (native fiber) depending on choice of derivatization.
