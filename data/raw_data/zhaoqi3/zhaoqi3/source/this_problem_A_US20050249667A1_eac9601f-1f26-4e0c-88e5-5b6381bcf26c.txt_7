[0812] U.S. Pat. No. 6,495,518 also discloses that: "Similarly, delivery of nucleic acids has been problematic. Methods currently employed include the permeabilization described above, with the above-described drawbacks, as well as vector-based delivery, such as with viral vectors, and liposome-mediated delivery. However, viral vectors can present additional risks to a patient, and liposome techniques have not achieved satisfactorily high levels of delivery into cells."
[0813] U.S. Pat. No. 6,495,518 also discloses that "Signal peptide sequences . . . which share the common motif of hydrophobicity, mediate translocation of most intracellular secretory proteins across mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and prokaryotic plasma membranes through the putative protein-conducting channels.2-11 Alternative models for secretory protein transport also support a role for the signal sequence in targeting proteins to membranes . . . . Several types of signal sequence-mediated inside-out membrane translocation pathways have been proposed. The major model implies that the proteins are transported across membranes through a hydrophilic protein conducting channel formed by a number of membrane proteins. 2-11 In eukaryotes, newly synthesized proteins in the cytoplasm are targeted to the ER membrane by signal sequences that are recognized generally by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its ER membrane receptors. This targeting step is followed by the actual transfer of protein across the ER membrane and out of the cell through the putative protein-conducting channel (for recent reviews, see references 2-5). In bacteria, the transport of most proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane also requires a similar protein-conducting channel. 7-11On the other hand, signal peptides can interact strongly with lipids, supporting the proposal that the transport of some secretory proteins across cellular membranes may occur directly through the lipid bilayer in the absence of any proteinaceous channels . . . . "
[0814] U.S. Pat. No. 6,495,518 also discloses that "Thus, though many attempts have been made to develop effective methods for importing biologically active molecules into cells, both in vivo and in vitro, none has proved to be entirely satisfactory." The solution to this problem, presented in claim 1 of the patent, is: "A method of importing a nuclear localization sequence of NF-.kappa.B into a cell in a subject, comprising administering a cyclic peptide consisting essentially of . . . to the subject, wherein said cyclic peptide is imported into a cell in the subject."
[0815] The process described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,495,518 may be used in conjunction with one or more of the therapeutic agents described elsewhere in this disclosure. In particular, such process may be used in conjunction with the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) which directs a moiety, to which it is attached, to the nucleus of the cell. The NLS is a short peptide usually, (but not limited to) 4 to 8 amino acid residues usually, but not limited to, highly charged species such as lysine or arginine, which can be covalently bound to the therapeutic molecule or other chemical of interest.
[0816] Nuclear localization sequences are well known to those skilled in the art. Thus, by way of illustration, reference may be had to U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,456, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. This patent is enitled "Cellular transport system for the transfer of a nucleic acid through the nuclear envelope and methods thereof," it discloses a method to use NLSs to transport transgenic nucleic acid molecules to the nucleus, and it claims "a nuclear transport agent for transferring a nucleic acid from cytoplasm into a nucleus of a eukaryotic cell comprising a first module and a second module, wherein the first module is module A that binds specifically to a DNA molecule so as not to form complexes consisting of more than one DNA molecule, and wherein the second module is module B that comprises an extended nuclear localization signal having a charge thus preventing the second module from mediating nonspecific binding of the nuclear transport agent to the DNA molecule."
