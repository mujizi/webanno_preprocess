[0020] The suitable average particle size of the carbon material, particularly the platelet material, is under 500 .mu.m, preferably in a range between 0.1 and 300 .mu.m, and particularly in a range between 0.1 and 100 .mu.m. Particle size refers to the agglomeration-free primary particle. The mass % of carbon material is advantageously less than 45% in the moldable blend. Mass percents in the range between 2 and 35% are particularly preferred.
[0021] The molding of the moldable material according to step c) usually occurs in a press, with it being possible to cure the material thermally or catalytically. Other pressure molding methods can also be used, depending on the consistency of the material. The addition of expanded graphite, in particular, leads to a relatively good sliding and flowing capability, so that injection molding or related molding techniques can also be carried out.
[0022] In step d), the resulting green body is baked (i.e. carbonized) at temperatures between 750 and 1200.degree. C. in the absence of air in order to produce the carbonaceous porous prebody (C/C body). During this process, the bonding resin is broken down into carbon. The carbonization may also be carried out at temperatures near 2400.degree. C. At these temperatures, the graphiting of carbon that has not yet been graphited occurs.
[0023] In the final step e), the C/C body is infiltrated with a silicon melt according to the conventional technique, preferably through the use of wicks. At least part of the carbon of the C/C body is converted into SiC. A ceramic composite material with a matrix composed predominantly of SiC is thereby formed. Residual silicon and residual carbon occur in the ceramic composite material as additional matrix components. When expanded graphite is used as the preferred added carbon material, a relatively low residual silicon content can be set. The proportion of free silicon (residual silicon) in the ceramic composite material according to the invention is thus advantageously under 10% by mass. In the case of an application as an anti-ballistic material or as a component of armor plating, the mass % of Si is preferably set at less than 7%. High SiC contents can be achieved in correspondence to the low residual silicon content. The proportion of SiC in the ceramic composite material is advantageously more than 60% by mass. A high SiC content is important particularly in anti-ballistic applications. In this case, the proportion of SiC is preferably above 70% by mass.
[0024] Beyond this, other metals besides silicon can be present in the silicon melt that is provided for the infiltration, such as Fe, Cr, W or Mo, the proportion of which in the melt typically does not exceed 20%. Ti is particularly preferred as an additional carbide forming metal. Silicon is also characterized as a metal in the context of this application. The ceramic composite material that is produced with the method according to the invention has a density of over 2.5 g/cm.sup.3. This value refers to infiltration with pure silicon. When silicon alloys containing metals of greater or lesser density than silicon are used, these density ranges must be adapted according to the theoretical values. The open porosity of the fiber-reinforced ceramic composite material is under 5% and the elongation at break is greater than 0.3%. The composite material that is produced by the method according to the invention thus advantageously combines a high material density (i.e. low porosity) with a relatively high elongation at break.
