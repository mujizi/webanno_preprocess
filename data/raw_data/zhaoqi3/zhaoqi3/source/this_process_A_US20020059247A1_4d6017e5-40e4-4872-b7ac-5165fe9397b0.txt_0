[0037] The use of these existing technical standards which have become conventional for the communication and reproduction of music for the registration of substance specific information required for homeopathic medicaments, allows processing of the spectra utilizing spectral analysis by data processing systems which have become conventional for the transmission and reproduction of music. As a result, these spectra can be transmitted via a global communication information network, especially the internet since any device which can be connected to the internet and can support the MP3 data format, for example, can be used for the process and reproduction of the homeopathic information. These devices include PC's, digital music reproduction devices, wireless mobile telephones and the like.
[0038] The MP3 format is widely used on the internet for the distribution of music and is practically supported by all terminals connected to the internet. It enables high quality storage and reproduction of the digital oscillation information while at the same time providing maximum compression. Both aspects are important for the use of the system to enable communication of homeopathic information from a website through the internet to a location or site of use. In fact, there are available small portable MP3 players on the market whereby the oscillation information can be readily reproduced.
[0039] In the method of reproducing homeopathic information in the form of electromagnetic oscillations according to the invention, one or more homeopathic spectra can be selected from an entire library of such spectra stored at a central website and based upon the need or desire at the downloading location. Upon downloading of the selected spectra or spectrum at this location by a data processor supporting the MP3 format and the storage of the downloaded spectrum or spectra in memory at this location, the downloaded spectra or spectrum can be converted into an analog signal, amplified and then applied to a device which utilizes the electromagnetic oscillations, preferably via at least one electrode or antenna. The selected spectrum or spectra from the internet site is thus capable of treating an individual or preparing specific medicaments or test solutions at the local site connected to the internet. Homeopathic information can thus be supplied by this process to any location connected to the internet and called up from any locality or terminal connected to the internet. Mobile diagnosis and therapy is possible and any required test substances and therapeutic materials can be effectively downloaded from the internet or prepared from the downloaded information.
[0040] Advantageously the selection of the spectra which are to be downloaded can be made based upon one or more symptoms of the patient or physiological indications which can be transmitted to the downloading or website. At the downloading or website symptom and physiological information can be recorded together with the spectrum or spectra.
[0041] The downloaded information may be a package of the spectra or spectrum and the information with respect to the symptoms and physiological indications (e.g. degree of debilitation, degree of stress, premenstrual syndromes, digestive disorders, headaches, chills, fever . . . ) can be delivered as a unit. The downloading can be effected by the click of the mouse to the terminal of the user. According to a feature of the invention, depending upon the selection made, the spectra themselves may be used or the sum of the spectra can be calculated and connected to the data processor.
