[0166] Diamond-diamond bonding tends to decrease as metal content in the diamond table increases. CVD and PVD processes can be conducted so that a transition zone is established. However, it is preferred for the bearing surface to be essentially pure polycrystalline diamond for low wear properties.
[0167] Generally CVD and PVD diamond is formed without large interstitial spaces filled with metal. Consequently, most PVD and CVD diamond is more brittle or has a lower fracture toughness than sintered polycrystalline diamond compacts. CVD and PVD diamond may also exhibit the maximum residual stresses possible between the diamond table and the substrate. It is possible, however, to form CVD and PVD diamond film that has metal incorporated into it with either a uniform or a functionally gradient composition.
[0168] One method for incorporating metal into a CVD or PVD diamond film it to use two different source materials in order to simultaneously deposit the two materials on a substrate in a CVD of PVD diamond production process. This method may be used regardless of whether diamond is being produced by CVD, PVD or a combination of the two.
[0169] Another method for incorporating metal into a CVD diamond film chemical vapor infiltration. This process would first create a porous layer of material, and then fill the pores by chemical vapor infiltration. The porous layer thickness should be approximately equal to the desired thickness for either the uniform or gradient layer. The size and distribution of the pores can be sued to control ultimate composition of the layer. Deposition in vapor infiltration occurs first at the interface between the porous layer and the substrate. As deposition continues, the interface along which the material is deposited moves outward from the substrate to fill pores in the porous layer. As the growth interface moves outward, the deposition temperature along the interface is maintained by moving the sample relative to a heater or by moving the heater relative to the growth interface. It is imperative that the porous region between the outside of the sample and the growth interface be maintained at a temperature that does not promote deposition of material (either the pore-filling material or undesired reaction products). Deposition in this region would close the pores prematurely and prevent infiltration and deposition of the desired material in inner pores. The result would be a substrate with open porosity an poor physical properties.
[0170] Another alternative manufacturing process that may be used to produce bearing surfaces and components of the invention involves use of energy beams, such as laser energy, to vaporize constituents in a substrate and redeposit those constituents on the substrate in a new form, such as in the form of a diamond coating. As an example, a metal, polymeric or other substrate may be obtained or produced containing carbon, carbides or other desired constituent elements. Appropriate energy, such as laser energy, may be directed at the substrate to cause constituent elements to move from within the substrate to the surface of the substrate adjacent the area of application of energy to the substrate. Continued application of energy to the concentrated constituent elements on the surface of the substrate can be used to cause vaporization of some of those constituent elements. The vaporized constituents may then be reacted with another element to change the properties and structure of the vaporized constituent elements.
