[0222](M5) The configuration control program 4030 changes the blockage flag of the internal LU where data were saved on the blocked parity group to Yes (that is, unusable) by referring to the internal LU configuration information.
[0223](M6) The configuration control program 4030 sends identification information of the blocked FMD 1030 to the management server 1300, if necessary. Information relating to the reason for blockage (for example, when judgment method was used to judge whether the blockage has occurred) may be attached to this notification. Furthermore, when a parity group, internal LU, or LU blocked by the blockage of the FMD 1030 is present, the identification information thereof also may be sent to the management server 1300. The management server 1300 that received the notification displays this information as failure information to the user.
[0224]In the explanation below, the state of a parity group that includes the FMD in a blocked state and in which an I/O request is possible will be termed "degenerate state". With an I/O request to a parity group in the degenerate state, a response to the request is made by conducting data recovery processing. The data recovery processing indicates the recovery of data of the blocked FMD from the redundant data. In the case of mirroring, because data identical to those in the blocked FMD are present in another FMD, this processing uses data of the respective FMD. In the case of a parity, this processing conducts recovery by computing the data of the blocked FMD from the parity and data that remained unblocked.

[0225]Dynamic sparing processing performed with the configuration control program 4030 will be described below.
