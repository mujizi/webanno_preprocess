Previous attempts have also been made to use liquid nitrogen for ground freezing. In Compressed Air Magazine of January 1964 on page 16 an article entitled: "Another Job for Cryogenics" describes a means of freezing a 3 foot diameter main using liquid nitrogen. The liquid nitrogen was passed from a storage tank into copper tubes embedded in the ground. The nitrogen vaporized in the tubes and was exhausted to the atmosphere via another pipeline.
In the freezing of larger volumes of ground with liquid nitrogen however it was found that the temperature of any particular section of ground is difficult to control. Liquid nitrogen in one section of freeze pipe would provide deep freezing while rapid vaporization might provide a suprisingly high temperature in another section adjacent the freeze pipe. This phenomenon of surge boiling that causes "freeze pockets" in the system is believed to be due to pressure fluctuations in the two phase liquid and gaseous nitrogen system. It can be appreciated that this phenomenon is detrimental to a controlled freezing operation. It can also be dangerous since a section of wall may not be completely frozen and consequently might cave in during the tunnelling or drilling operation.
It has now been discovered that this problem of uneven ground freezing can be substantially reduced by providing a method of ground freezing wherein pressure fluctuation in the liquid and gaseous nitrogen system is substantially eliminated.
It is therefore an objection of this invention to provide an improved method of ground freezing by means of liquid nitrogen.
It is another object of this invention to provide an apparatus for ground freezing by means of nitrogen which provides more accurate control of the flow of nitrogen through the ground freezing system.
