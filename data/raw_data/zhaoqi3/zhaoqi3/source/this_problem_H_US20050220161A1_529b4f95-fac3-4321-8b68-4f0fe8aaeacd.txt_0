[0003] The ability to control polarization properties of optical radiation is of importance for many applications. In particular, pumping of optical amplifiers, such as erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) and Raman amplifiers, which are commonly employed in optical communication systems, typically require sources of high-power laser radiation having a very low degree of polarization (DoP).
[0004] The DoP of optical radiation is commonly defined as a ratio of the optical power of a prevailing polarization component of the optical radiation to the total optical power thereof, with a DoP equal to zero corresponding to totally non-polarized light. In optical amplifiers, pump radiation having a non-zero DoP induces a polarization dependant gain (PDG), which is generally detrimental to the system performance. For Raman amplifiers, a low PDG can be achieved by using pump laser light with a low degree of polarization. However, high-power laser diodes commonly used for pumping of optical amplifiers emit strongly polarized optical radiation having a high degree of polarization.
[0005] A prior art solution to this problem is shown in FIG. 1, wherein orthogonally-polarized light from two pump lasers 120 and 130 is combined into a combined light beam 195 by using a polarization maintaining beam combiner (PBC) 190. If the optical radiation from individual pumps have equal DoPs at the optical input ports 191 and 192 of the PBC 190, and the polarization beam combiner has the same optical loss for radiation from both pump lasers, the combined laser beam 195 outputted from the PBC 190 is substantially depolarized, i.e. has DoP which is a close to zero, when the laser diodes have equal output powers.
[0006] In order to maintain equal pump powers from the pump lasers after the PBC 190 and therefore to maintain the DoP of the combined pump beam 195 at a low enough level, two tap couplers 15 are used in the path of radiation from each laser 120 and 130, with a small portion of the pump light being tapped to photodiodes 140 and 180 respectively. Electrical signals from the photodiodes 140, 180 are fed to a pump controller 110, which controls the output pump power from the pump lasers 120 and 130.
[0007] However, the "through" paths of the tap couplers 15, i.e. the optical paths from the output of the laser pumps 120 and 130 to the input ports 191 and 192 of the PBC 190 respectively, have to maintain the polarization of the lasers' radiation, to ensure that there is no change of the polarization of the pump radiation at the input PBC ports 191, 192 at different operating conditions. Therefore in the prior art configuration shown in FIG. 1, the taps 140 and 180 have to be preferably polarization maintaining, which are more expensive than conventional, non-polarization maintaining tap couplers.
