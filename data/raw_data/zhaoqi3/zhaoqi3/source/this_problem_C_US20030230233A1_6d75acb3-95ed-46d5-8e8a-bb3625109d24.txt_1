[0013] Most applications for relaxed Si.sub.1-xGe.sub.x layers require an atomic Ge content above about 15% (x=0.15). In order to increase the Ge content in the layer, the precursor concentration of germane must be increased, thereby increasing particle defect generation.
[0014] Thus, it would be desirable to develop a method of producing relaxed SiGe layers on a semiconductor substrate that minimizes particle defect generation during deposition of SiGe layers, especially for high-Ge-content SiGe layers.
[0015] One solution to this problem is to change the gas chemistry such that deposition on the reactor walls is reduced, especially when producing Si.sub.1-xGe.sub.x layers having a x value greater than 0.15. Thus, it is desirable to use a germanium precursor that decomposes at higher temperature.
[0016] Since the main problem in SiGe film growth is the low decomposition temperature of the germane gas, the present invention uses a germanium precursor having a higher decomposition temperature than germane, such as a germanium-halide. In this way, the decomposition temperatures of the precursors can be optimally chosen such that very high growth rates can be achieved at high growth temperatures, yet excessive reactor coating and particle defect introduction can be kept to a minimum.
[0017] Germanium halides include germanium-chlorine-containing species such as GeCl.sub.4, or GeHCl.sub.3, or GeH.sub.2Cl.sub.2, germanium-fluorine containing species, such as GeF.sub.4, as well as germanium-bromine-containing species, such as GeBr.sub.4, germanium-iodine-containing species, such as GeI.sub.4, and germanium-astatine containing species, such as GeAt.sub.4. In addition, any other combinations of these halides with germanium, such as GeClBr.sub.3 or more generally a germanium-halide(1).sub.x-halide(2).sub.-y, where x+y=4, that have a higher decomposition temperature than germane may be used as a germanium precursor. These precursors can, unlike germane, be used at growth temperatures in excess of 800.degree. C. to grow thick, relaxed SiGe layers without excessive reactor wall coating and particle defect formation. They can be utilized in gaseous form or in liquid form. In the case of a liquid precursor, a hydrogen carrier gas is typically bubbled through the liquid, and vapor from the liquid is carried into the reactor. Thus, typically the precursor will be in gaseous form inside the reactor. The germanium halide precursors can be combined with any of the typical silicon precursors, such as SiH.sub.4, SiH.sub.2Cl.sub.2, SiHCl.sub.3, SiHCl.sub.4. Another advantage of this approach is that higher growth temperatures lead to lower threading dislocation densities in the relaxed graded layer. Thus, incorporating a different precursor for germanium leads to a lower defect density in the relaxed SiGe layers.
