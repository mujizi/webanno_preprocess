[0728] Example 3a, Step 1: N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (5.7 g) was suspended in CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 (80 mL) and cooled to 0.degree. C. prior to the addition of 2.0 M AlMe.sub.3 (29.1 mL) in hexane. The mixture was warmed to rt over 1 h, then cooled to 0.degree. C. prior to the addition of benzyl (1R,2S,5R)-7-oxo-6-oxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-ylcar-bamate (8.0 g) in CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 (80 mL). After 5 h at 0.degree. C., the reaction was quenched with a 10% Rochelle salt solution and extracted with EtOAc (2.times.). The organic extracts were combined, washed with brine, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered, and concentrated. The resulting residue was dissolved in DMF (100 mL) prior to the addition of imidazole (1.97 g) and TBSCl (4.4 g). The reaction was stirred for 12 h at rt and then partitioned between EtOAc and a saturated brine solution. The organic phases were combined, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography to afford benzyl (1S,2R,4R)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-2-(methoxy(met-hyl)carbamoyl)cyclohexylcarbamate (11.2 g). MS found: (M+H).sup.+=451.3.
[0729] Example 3a, Step 2: Benzyl (1S,2R,4R)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy-)-2-(methoxy(methyl)carbamoyl)cyclohexylcarbamate (4.0 g) was dissolved in THF (40 mL) and cooled to -22.degree. C. prior to the addition of 1.6 M MeLi (14.5 mL) in Et.sub.2O. After 40 min at -22.degree. C., the reaction was quenched with 0.5 N HCl solution and extracted with EtOAc (2.times.). The organic extracts were combined, washed with brine, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered, and concentrated. The resulting residue was purified by flash chromatography to afford benzyl (1S,2R,4R)-2-acetyl-4-(-tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohexylcarbamate (5.7 g). MS found: (M +H).sup.+=406.3.
[0730] Example 3a, Step 3: Methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (1.2 g) was suspended in toluene (16 mL) prior to the addition of 0.5M potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (5.8 mL) in toluene. After 1 h, this solution was cooled to 0.degree. C. prior to the addition of benzyl (1S,2R,4R)-2-acetyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohexylcarbamate (660 mg) in toluene (5.4 mL). After 20 min at 0.degree. C., the reaction was quenched with saturated NH.sub.4Cl solution and extracted with EtOAc (2.times.). The organic extracts were combined, washed with brine, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered, and concentrated. The resulting residue was purified by flash chromatography to afford benzyl (1S,2S,4R)-4-(tert-buty-ldimethylsilyloxy)-2-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylcarbamate (380 mg). MS found: (M+H).sup.+=404.2.
[0731] Example 3a, Step 4: Benzyl (1S,2S,4R)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy-)-2-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylcarbamate (4.8 g) in MeOH (40 mL) was charged with 10% Pd/C, Degussa (600 mg). The reaction flask was evacuated and then back-filled with hydrogen; this was repeated three more times. The reaction was stirred under 1 atm of H.sub.2 for 4 h and then filtered and concentrated to provide (1S,2S,4R)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-2-i-sopropylcyclohexanamine (2.9 g). MS (ES+)=272.3 (M+H).sup.+.
[0732] Example 3a, Step 5: (1S,2S,4R)-4-(Tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-2-iso-propylcyclohexanamine (2.9 g) was dissolved in DMF (36 mL) and cooled to 0.degree. C. prior to the addition of N-Cbz methionine (5.5 g), 4-methyl morpholine (3.8 g), and BOP (8.7 g). The reaction was stirred for 12 h at rt and then partitioned between EtOAc and 1N HCl solution. The organic phases were combined, washed with saturated NaHCO.sub.3 and brine, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography to afford benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S,4R)-4-(te-rt-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-2-isopropylcyclohexylamino)-4-(methylthio)-1-oxo-butan-2-ylcarbamate (5.3 g).
