To achieve further color effects the fabric is then dyed, for example by a conventional exhaust method, with 1% (in a liquor ratio of 10:1, based on the weight of the fabric) of the electrolyte-containing dye of the formula (known from DE-A-1 943 904) ##STR12## The result is a red print on a red ground of different hue.
EXAMPLE 5
A bleached and mercerized cotton fabric is printed with an aqueous solution which within 1,000 parts contains 100 parts of 2-oxo-1,3-oxazolidine, 200 parts of sodium trichloroacetate and 650 parts of water by introducing the pretreatment liquor into an ink cartridge of a commercial inkier printer and then inkjet printing this solution. Commercial programs are used to create patterns and these are sprayed onto the textile via the printer. The printed fabric is fixed with hot air at 160.degree. C. for 5 minutes. The invisible print pattern is then washed at 80.degree. C. for 5 minutes to remove excess alkali. The fabric thus pretreated is then exposed in a ratio of 10:1 to an aqueous dye liquor containing 6% (based on the weight of the fabric) of an electrolyte-containing dye of the following formula: ##STR13## at 60.degree. C. for 30 minutes. After the dyeing process has ended, the fabric is rinsed, briefly soaped at 60.degree. C. and rinsed once more. The result is a cloth which has been dyed black only in those areas where the print pattern is located. The dyeing liquor is replenished with dye and is ready for the next dyeing. To achieve further color effects the fabric is then dyed, for example by a customary exhaust method, with 2% (in a liquor ratio of 10:1, based on the fabric weight) of the electrolyte-containing dye of the formula (known from Swiss Patent Application Publication CH 350 390) ##STR14## The result is a deep black print on a brilliant red ground (scarlet).
