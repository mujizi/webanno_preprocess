[0023] Another aspect of an embodiment of the present invention is that power output remains constant above rated speed avoiding power fluctuations dependent on speed changes. Due to the topology of the invention, power is only delivered to the grid through the stator of the doubly fed induction generator. Thus, the rotor power ripple is avoided and the output power quality of the wind turbine is improved.
[0024] Another aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention describes a variable speed wind turbine that uses Grid Flux Orientation (GFO) to accurately control the power injected to the grid. An advantage of this control system is that it does not depend on machine parameters, which may vary significantly, and theoretical machine models, avoiding the use of additional adjusting loops and achieving a better power quality fed into the utility grid.
[0025] A further aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is that the method for synchronization of the doubly fed induction generator avoids the consumption of reactive power during the connection and disconnection to/from the grid, complying with the new grid compliance regulations. Moreover, this method may avoid connection current peaks through connecting devices, increasing the lifetime of such components.
[0026] A further aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a control method to avoid the "wearing" of the collector of a DC motor when used to drive the pitch movement of the blade and improves the lubrication of the bearings of the blades.
[0027] Another aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is that in the case of an incidental stop of the wind turbine, although a doubly fed induction generator is used, it is possible to apply electric braking. In the event of an emergency, such as a persistent grid fault, an incidental stop of the wind turbine may happen. Then, the exciter machine is used as generator and power can be transferred from exciter machine to direct current Bus. Then, the electric brake may be activated and part of the electric power is drained in the rheostat of the chopper helping the generator to stop progressively and avoiding great mechanical strengths in wind turbine components.
