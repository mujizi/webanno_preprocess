[0117] The devices can be patterned using a blocking layer of material, such as a material that is insoluble in the electrolyte composition. Exemplary blocking materials include polystyrene, etc. The blocking material can be applied to the working electrode using spray-casting, drop-casting, ink jet, screen printing, roll to roll printing processes, reel to reel processing, spin coating, meniscus and dip coating, brush coating, doctor blade application, curtain casting, and the like. This layer now blocks the electrical field produced within the device upon application of voltage, which results in no polymer forming in these areas. The device, when in situ polymerized, will then be patterned around the blocking layer. When the device is switched, the blocking layer will remain constant as the electrochromic changes color around it. The blocking layer may be loaded with a dye, such that in one state, the electrochromic is the same color as the blocking layer but in another state it is not, thus allowing for the patterned image/lettering/numbering/etc to be reversibly "revealed" and "concealed" upon switching.
[0118] In the patterning process using selective application of voltage, an electrochemical atomic force microscope (AFM) tip can be used as an external counter electrode to supply the voltage. In an alternative embodiment, injection polymerization can be accomplished using a needle to supply both a voltage and the combination of an electroactive monomer and electrolyte composition.
[0119] In one embodiment, a nanolithographic pattern may be generated by utilizing electrochemical atomic force microscopy (AFM) to selectively polymerize the electroactive monomer. In this method, an AFM tip (coated with a conductor such as gold, platinum/iridium, carbon, optionally modified with carbon nanotubes) is used as a counter electrode. The AFM tip is either brought into contact with the combination of electrolyte composition and electroactive monomer or brought into the proximity of the combination of electrolyte composition and electroactive monomer without touching the combination, and a suitable voltage is applied between the electrochemical AFM tip and the substrate, which promotes polymerization of the electroactive monomer contacted by (or brought in close proximity to) the AFM tip.
[0120] In one embodiment, the device can be prepared with individually addressable electrode systems, thus allowing for pixilation of a device. Such devices are useful for simple display applications.
[0121] The electrochromic devices are capable of displaying a still or animated color image composed of a combination of red, green, and blue visible light. Displaying occurs typically by reflection or transmission of visible light rather than by emission when the electrochromic material is subjected to an electrical potential.
