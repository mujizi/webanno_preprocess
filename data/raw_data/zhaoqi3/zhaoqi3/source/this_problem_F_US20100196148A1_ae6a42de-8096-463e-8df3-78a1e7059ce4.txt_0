[0063] Oil is supplied to the bearing housing 71 for lubrication of the bearing 81 and passes to the bearing through oil channels 93 and 94 at the compressor end and turbine end of the bearing 82 respectively. The bearing 82 is provided with oil passageways 95 which permit oil to flow through the bearing to the shaft 81. An aperture 96 in a central portion of the bearing 82 ensures that oil can drain freely from the inner bearing surfaces. The bearing housing also defines an annular splash chamber 97 at the turbine end of the bearing housing which collects oil splashing back from the rotating seal boss 80 and delivers this to the bearing cavity oil drain 98, which is steeper than is conventionally the case as a result of the integral casting of the bearing housing and heat shield (which can be beneficial when the turbine is inclined--such as when it is included in a vehicle which is on an incline).
[0064] The oil supply to the bearing housing can come from any appropriate source. Typically the oil supply will be delivered from the pressurised oil supply system of a combustion engine, for instance via an oil feed from the combustion engine crank case. Similarly, the oil may drain from the bearing housing to a sump which may be the oil sump of the internal combustion engine, or a gear box oil sump. It will be appreciated that other oil supply arrangements are possible.
[0065] Oil pressure within the bearing housing may vary, but will generally be higher than the pressure in the turbine housing behind the turbine wheel. This is particularly the case for an axial flow power turbine as pressures below atmospheric pressure can be generated behind the turbine wheel. Pressure drop from the bearing housing to the turbine housing can exacerbate the problem of oil leakage from the bearing housing into the turbine housing, and thus into the exhaust gas flow. In accordance with the present invention this problem is addressed by pressurising the cavity 78 defined between the heat shield 72 and the bearing housing 71 via the passage 79. Pressure within the cavity 78 is transmitted to the portion of the seal boss passage 85 which is defined between the first and second seal rings 90 and 91. This has the effect of raising the pressure behind the first seal ring 90 which seals the shaft (seal boss 80) with respect to the bearing housing. Reducing the pressure drop across the seal ring 90 from the bearing housing to the turbine housing reduces the likelihood of oil leakage past the seal ring 90 from the bearing housing.
[0066] The heat shield cavity 78 may be pressurised to a pressure above that typically encountered in the bearing housing. A pressure of as little as about 0.2 bar gauge to about 1 bar gauge may be sufficient in a typical power turbine. Although oil supply to the bearing housing may be supplied at a pressure of around 5 bar gauge, the oil pressure in the vicinity of the seal boss 80 will generally be much lower than this given the restricted flow paths for the oil to reach this region of the bearing housing.
[0067] Raising the pressure in the heat shield cavity 78, and thus in the portion of the passage 85 between the seal rings 90 and 91 will have a beneficial effect in the reduction of oil leakage across the seal ring 90. That is, even if the raised pressure within the cavity 78 remains below that within the bearing housing in the region of the seal boss 80, the pressure difference across the seal ring 90 may nevertheless be reduced. However, it is preferable that the pressure within the cavity 78 is at a level at least generally approximate the maximum pressure that will occur in the bearing housing adjacent the seal boss 80, and more preferably still higher than this level.
