where y is an integer from 0-20; and ##STR5## where X is 0, S or NR"; and m is an integer from 0-3 with the proviso that said olefin have no allylic hydrogens and that at least one R-group not be hydrogen.
Exemplary olefins which satisfy the above structural formula include butadiene, tertiary butylethylene, vinyl furan, methyl vinyl ketone, N-vinyl pyrrolidone, and the like. A presently preferred olefin for use in the practice of this process is butadiene because of its ready availability, relatively low cost, and the wide range of possible uses for the epoxide reaction product.
The epoxides produced by this process have the structural formula: ##STR6## wherein each R is independently defined as set forth above. Where one or more of the R-groups contain carbon-carbon bond unsaturation, further oxidation can be carried out, thereby producing polyepoxide products.
The process is carded out by contacting the olefin to be oxidized with molecular oxygen and an organic halide under oxidation conditions, i.e. in the presence of sufficient quantities of an oxygen-containing gas to provide a molar ratio of olefin to oxygen in the range of about 0.01 up to about 20, and in the presence of about 0. 1 up to about 1000 parts per million (by volume of total feed) of organic halide. Preferred quantities of organic halide for use in the practice of the present invention fall within the range of about 1 up to about 100 parts per million, by volume of total feed.
While greater or lesser quantities of molecular oxygen can be employed, sufficient quantifies of oxygen should be provided to insure that undesirably low levels of olefin conversion do not occur, while excessively high oxygen concentrations should be avoided to prevent the formation of explosive mixtures. Similarly, lower levels of organic halide will provide negligible effect on catalyst performance, while higher levels of organic halide would not be expected to provide any significant improvement in catalyst performance.
