[0013] Additionally, when the loads to be transmitted are very large, in particular in the case of heavy high-thrust engines, it may be found necessary to reinforce the attachment device. This then leads to an increase in the number of attachment points. Thus, the attachment of the bracket to the intermediate part, when it exists, or directly to the pylon must be provided by two rows of four bolts instead of two rows of two bolts as used habitually. This means that the bracket attached to the pylon must be made stiffer, which is achieved by increasing its dimensions. Thus, the width of the bracket may, for example, be virtually doubled relative to that of a conventional bracket.
[0014] With such an arrangement, it is easy to see that the loading of the four bolts is not uniform. Indeed, the two bolts located outboard transmit little load relative to the two bolts located inboard. In fact, about 20% of the loads are applied to the outer bolts and 80% of the loads are applied to the inner bolts. With time, this proportion generates much greater structural fatigue of the inner bolts than of the outer bolts. This leads to a much higher probability of failure for the inner bolts.
[0015] This problem could be resolved by reinforcing the inner bolts. However this would involve resorting to a specific tool for tightening these bolts. Additionally, such bolts would protrude into the airflow and generate drag. Also, in view of the limited space available in the attachment device, this solution is difficult to apply in practice.
PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION
[0016] The invention precisely covers a device for attachment of an engine to a pylon on an aircraft, whose original design preserves the integrity of the attachment of the engine even in the event of failure of one of the parts of the main attachment structure or of the intermediate part, if one exists, whilst at the same time providing homogeneous distribution and transmission of the engine loads to the pylon.
