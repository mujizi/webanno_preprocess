[0069] A blend of polymers can be described as a mixture of silicone and polyphosphazene polymers, commonly formed by using a suitable cosolvent for each polymer, or using a melt. The formation of a homogeneous or intergradient blend can be achieved in addition to the formation of a heterogeneous blend with more than one interphase. All ratios of silicone and polyphosphazene polymers in a blend are encompassed by this invention.
[0070] Again, while not bound by theory, it is thought that an interpenetrating network can be understood in terms of polymer chains (backbone units with side groups) diffusing from one polymer into the other, and interacting with polymer chains of the other in order to create a proper adhesion between the different polymers. In this aspect, the term semi-interpenetrating network is often used, as one polymer (for example, the silicone-containing polymer) comprises a crosslinked polymer chain, while the other polymer (the polyphosphazene) can be non-crosslinked and is diffusing into the other polymer. A semi-interpenetrating network can differ from the interpenetrating network by one or more polymer(s) being crosslinked and forming a stable network matrix while the other polymer is non-crosslinked. In a true interpenetrating network, which is another aspect of this invention, both polymers can be crosslinked.
[0071] Several synthetic strategies can be used to form the combinations or copolymers disclosed above. In this aspect, for example, copolymers can be formed by copolymerizing a suitable mixture of monomeric precursors or small, low molecular weight oligomers of a silicone and a polyphosphazene at the same time or at similar times. By attaching these monomer/precursor units of one polymer to the other polymer and then subsequently polymerizing these monomer units while being "grafted" on the backbone of the other polymer, a stable copolymer can be formed. In this context, this can be effected by copolymerizing suitable phosphazene precursors with suitable siloxane precursors or a silicone polymer chain. In this example, this method would provide a copolymer of A grafted on B, wherein polyphosphazene chains (and/or their precursors) are grafted on the backbone of a siloxane.
[0072] This type of grafting process can also involve a stepwise increase in molecular weight of the grafted polyphosphazene side chains in relation to the distance of the silicone polymer phase to the polyphosphazene phase. A gradual shift in molecular weight will increase the diffusion of the polyphosphazene polymer into the silicone polymer phase while allowing a gradual transition in surface energy, resulting in an even stronger adhesion between the two polymers.
[0073] In another aspect, this type of grafting could also be achieved by using polyphosphazene polymers that contain siloxane anchor groups at the terminal positions of the polymer. Due to having hydrolytically labile alkoxy substituents, these would combine with the silicone polymer during curing.
