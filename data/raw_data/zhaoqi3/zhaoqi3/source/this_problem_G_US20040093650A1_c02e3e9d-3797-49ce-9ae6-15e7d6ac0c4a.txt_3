[0026] According to the invention, the operation module has no wheels at all or any number of wheels. Most common would be two, three or four wheels. In any of these cases, the combined unit comprising an autonomous mobile robot and an operation module would have more than five wheels. According to the discussion above, this would result in an undefined contact with the ground. If one or more wheels are lifted or suspended on docking, this problem is solved. Then the combined unit would only have three wheels in firm contact with the ground. In one embodiment, the robot and the module are coupled with a coupling that allows rotation around an axis normal to a vertical connection plane between the robot and the module. In this way, four wheels are always in firm contact with the ground.
[0027] In yet another embodiment of the invention the robot has a coupling hatch by which the front end of an operational module is lifted such that only two or preferably no wheels are in firm contact with the ground. In an another preferred embodiment all, all but one or at least all but two wheels of the operation module are freely swivelable in all directions around an axis normal to the horizontal plane. In another preferred embodiment of a combined unit, one or two wheels of the operating module are in firm contact with the ground and thus act as tracking wheels. To accomplish this a pair of freely swivelable wheels on the mobile robot are locked in a longitudinal orientation for tracking when the autonomous mobile robot is uncoupled from an module. In another embodiment, this problem is solved by a raisable and lowerable tracking wheel of a fixed longitudinal orientation which is lowered for tracking when the autonomous mobile robot is not coupled to a wheeled module.
[0028] It is difficult to construct mathematical models for steering an autonomous mobile robot, which is coupled to a wheeled operation module, if the mathematical model must take into consideration the present orientation of the autonomous mobile robot in addition to the orientation of the wheeled operation module. This problem is dealt with by the axle construction. By making the coupling hitch frame pivotable relative to the driven wheel axle, the number and the complexity of the sensors on the autonomous mobile robot is decreased. The term "wheeled" in the claims is also intended to encompass wheeled robots having crawler or caterpillar tracks around the wheels.
[0029] An advantageous hitching means between the autonomous mobile robot and the selected operation module is defined whereby the coupling and decoupling is effected automatically without requiring that the center lines of the autonomous mobile robot and the operation module be in exact alignment before coupling.
[0030] The problem of automatically determining the length and orientation relative to the autonomous mobile robot of the operation module, and the presence or absence of obstacles beside the operation module is solved by the sensor constructions.
