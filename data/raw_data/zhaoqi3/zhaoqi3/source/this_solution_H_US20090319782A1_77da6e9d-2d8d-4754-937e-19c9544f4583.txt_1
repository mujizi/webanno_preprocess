[0232] The PC on a USB drive or cell phone solution may incorporate: (1) the trusted platform module chip 21 to hardware secure encryption-authentication keys and certificates; (2) a USB drive-memory to store encrypted data, keys, nanokernel, etc.; (3) Moore's Law memory configuration so that it is inexpensive enough and large enough to scale to meet increasing memory demands and performance requirements; (4) secure BIOS; (5) a nanokernel to boot from, this is a self-contained nanokernel or minikernel to provide a secure boot 41, and simply plug the USB drive 12 into any computer 11 and utilize its CPU, but load the nanokernel to perform the processing and all input/output is done to the secure USB device 12 (i.e. no data is stored on the host computer 11); (6) a list of allowed applications that the secure nanokernel only allow to be run in its environment, any other application is prevented from executing on the data stored on the secure USB device 12; and (7) biometrics to identify a person wherein a USB device 12 may have a fingerprint scanner and or heartbeat sensor, while a cell phone may have voice and/or facial recognition and a wireless USB interface.
[0233] There may be at least two form factors: (1) one looks like a USB drive (thumb drive) but contains everything a user needs to work in a "secure, virtual" environment, and the secure USB device 12 would plug into any computer, but only use the nanokernel 23, applications 28, and disk space that are encrypted; and (2) the other one may look like a cell phone or other portable device with all of the above features, but also have a wired or wireless USB interface to allow connection to the host computer 11.
[0234] The virtual PC solution adds the capability to bring along a trusted nanokernel 23 and applications 28 that the user or session can run. For example, this solution may support multiple users and support a Multi-Level Security environment as well.
[0235] The user's desired computing environment is run from the virtual PC solution, and more than encrypted data is stored on the USB device 12. Essentially, the user has everything that is needed to perform secure computing at one's fingertips, but can be taken to any Internet Cafe or kiosk to use a USB port on a host computer 11 to provide a computing platform without having to carry around a laptop. AirPhones.RTM. or computers on airplanes may be replaced with wireless USB connections to a central computer to allow multiple virtual environments (i.e., one per user) to perform computing with a wireless USB device 12, cell phone or PDA.
[0236] Additionally, computer forensics can be combined with biometric databases to add a another dimension to evaluate the computing environment (i.e., automation to make a "judgment" as to whether or not a host computing environment is "trustworthy" to host the USB device 12, cell phone or PDA solution).
