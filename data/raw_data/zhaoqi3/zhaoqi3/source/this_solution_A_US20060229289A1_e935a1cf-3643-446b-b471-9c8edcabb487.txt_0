EXAMPLE 1B
1-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-2-methylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid
[0127] A solution of Example 1A (15.15 g, 54.63 mmol) in a mixture of THF (100 mL) and water (50 mL) was treated with LiOH.H.sub.2O (4.58 g, 109.26 mmol) in water (50 mL). Methanol was added until a transparent solution formed (60 mL). This solution was heated at 60.degree. C. for overnight and the organic solvents were removed under vacuum. The residual aqueous solution was acidified with 2 N HCl to pH 2 and was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic phase was washed with water, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered and concentrated to give Example 1B as a white solid (13.72 g, 95.4% yield). MS (DCI/NH.sub.3) m/z 264 (M+H).sup.+.
