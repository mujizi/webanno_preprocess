[0054] The ballast survey computing system 118 calculates the area of the space by treating each sensor measurement point in the line 400 as an independent statistical sample of the space. This is converted into a volume by multiplying the computed area of the space by the known distance between cross-sectional samples, which is a function of the sampling or refresh rate of the LIDAR and computer system, and the speed of the ballast profiling vehicle (200 in FIG. 2A) along the tracks. In one embodiment, the ballast profiling system scans cross-sectional profiles (each comprised of many data points) at a rate of 50 Hz, while the vehicle travels at a speed of 10 mph, thus providing cross-sectional profiles every 0.294 ft along the track. While in an alternative embodiment the LIDAR profile rate can be speed-dependent, the LIDAR devices can also rotate at a constant rate, as discussed above, so that the slower the vehicle moves, the closer each profile is to the next.
[0055] One benefit of this approach is that it does not involve calculation of the actual geometry of the set of measured data points. That is, the points in the existing cross section 400 do not need to be meshed together to form a cohesive surface. Because meshing is not required, the calculation of the needed ballast space can be performed very quickly. In one embodiment, the method disclosed herein has been practiced by registering an ideal ballast profile 404, provided by a railroad company, to a LIDAR scan profile 400 of a section of railroad track, then calculating any missing ballast with reference to the ideal profile.
[0056] A flowchart of an embodiment of the computational process is shown in FIG. 5. In this process, a portion of existing railroad track surface is scanned with the remote sensing device. Using two LIDAR devices (as shown in FIGS. 1-3), allows the system to capture both left and right cross-sectional profiles of the track, as indicated at 502. The video camera (122 in FIG. 1) also captures a video image of the track, as indicated at 504, while the wheel encoder measures speed and distance of travel of the ballast profiling system (step 506), allowing the system to determine location (block 508). Alternatively, or additionally, the ballast profiling vehicle can determine the location of curves using a GPS device (126 in FIG. 1) in order to apply the appropriate ideal track profile.
[0057] While these measurements are being taken, the system can also receive user input, as indicated at 510, for indicating No Dump zone locations (crossings, switches, greasers, bridges, hot box detectors, etc), mile post locations, or a general note (e.g. dump light, steep slope, dump inside track in this section, mud spots, heavy rain, track section has already been dumped, etc.) Steps 502-510 in FIG. 5 can happen generally concurrently, and together provide the data that is received and combined at step 512 to produce a point set (e.g. the points for the surface 400 of FIG. 4).
[0058] Using this data, surfaces are numerically registered by the computer to create the boundaries of volume V of interest in the point set. The system calculates how many scan points P sample the inside of volume V. The system then calculates the weighting of the scan points P by taking the surface area of the volume V and dividing it by the number of scan points P. This can be referred to as "point weighting" or P-weight. This is an even weighting method and is one method of determining how much of the profile each point represents. In this approach the point density is higher near the LIDARs and less at the edges of the profile because of the angular spread of the LIDAR beam (206 in FIG. 2A).
