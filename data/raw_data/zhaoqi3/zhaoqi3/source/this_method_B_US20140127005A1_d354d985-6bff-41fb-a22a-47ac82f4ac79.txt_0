[0039] Generally speaking, however, other shapes for the wax structures 21 are also possible, as shown in FIG. 1A, which shows a part of a wax structure 21 with an angular structure. FIG. 1B shows rod-shaped wax structures 21 with a round cross-section.
[0040] The wax model 20 is intended for use in a precision-casting method. The wax models 20 are here typically formed out of special waxes, thermoplastics or mixtures thereof and are made for example by injection moulding.
[0041] The wax models 20 have a comparatively low melting point, allowing them to be melted out of a casting mould, not shown here, during the precision-casting process. This casting method with lost mould permits the manufacture of very fine component structural elements 11 at very low tolerances. The surface quality too of the components 10 manufactured by this method is very good, so that as a rule no further reworking is required.
[0042] Components 10 can therefore be manufactured that have fine component structural elements 11, for example closely adjacent linear component structures 11 and/or rod-shaped component structural elements 11.
[0043] To achieve good adhesion of the ceramic coating 2 to be applied later on (see FIG. 4), of a plastic-containing coating 6, 7 (see FIG. 7) and/or of a plastic component, in a next process step the tips 23 of the wax structures 21 are plastically shaped by a thermal and/or mechanical treatment T (symbolized by arrows in FIG. 1) using a contact plate 5. The result of this is a widened tip 23, which can for example be designed rounded or mushroom-shaped. Underneath the widened tip 23 is an undercut 22, which--as described in the following--is important for the connection to the coating 2 (ceramic and/or plastic-containing) (see FIGS. 4, 7) and/or the plastic component. The contact plate 5 can here not only be designed flat, but also have contours adapted to the wax model 20. The shaping of the tips 23 can be assisted by selective application of a compressive force.
