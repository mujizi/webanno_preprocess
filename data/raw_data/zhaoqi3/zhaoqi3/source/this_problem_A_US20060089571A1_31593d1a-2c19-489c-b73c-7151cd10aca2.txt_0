[0192] In another embodiment, a transgastric fastening assembly may be required at the region of the cardia 402 to treat morbid obesity in a similar manner to that utilized with the LAP-BAND.TM. (Inamed Corp., Santa Barbara, Calif.). In this embodiment, the transgastric fastening assembly is not utilized to reduce the volume of the stomach, but to create a restriction to the inflow of food. In this embodiment, the fastening system can traverse the cardia but does not necessarily completely oppose the mucosal surfaces of the anterior and posterior walls of the stomach. In some embodiments, the transgastric assemblies do in fact completely appose the walls of the stomach together but allow food to pass through by not completely traversing the cardia, leaving a space for flow of food stuffs. The assembly can further be configured to provide electrical signals to the anterior and/or posterior portions of the stomach in this region. The active region of this embodiment can be quite large, in some cases ranging up to 10-15 cm, large enough to traverse almost the entire width of the cardia.
[0193] In another embodiment, the disclosed methods in combination with the transgastric fastening assemblies can be adapted to attach a gastrointestinal organ to the abdominal wall which, in addition to reducing volume, can also create a kink in the organ (e.g. the stomach). The kink may cause a resistance barrier (in addition to volume reduction) to gastrointestinal contents and can be useful to treat reflux disease or morbid obesity. Such a kink would also fix the gastrointestinal region to the abdominal wall as well as maintain the reduction of a hiatal hernia in the abdominal compartment (e.g. in reflux disease). A major component of reflux disease is a hiatal hernia in which the gastroesophageal junction freely slides from the abdomen to the mediastinum. A percutaneously placed suture or anchor in the region of the gastric cardia and/or fundus can tether the junction to the abdominal wall and confine the junction to the abdomen.
[0194] In other embodiments, the devices and methods of this invention can assist in the implantation of devices such as stents, meshes, stitches, or tubes in the gastrointestinal tract. A major technical difficulty encountered in placing stents, tubes, balloons, stimulators, and meshes inside the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is that they tend to migrate because the walls of such devices do not adhere to slippery mucosa. A transgastric or transintestinal anchor, implanted with the current instrumentation, could solve this problem. Such a method would be particularly useful in the attachment of the stent part of the stent-sleeve system outlined in patent application US20050075622A1, or the mesh of patent application US20040172141A1. In another example, devices such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6773441 attempt to place an endoscopic stitch to tether the cardia of the stomach to the fundus to treat reflux disease. Such stitches are tenuous in the long term because they do not necessarily penetrate the serosa. Even if the stitches penetrate the serosa, they tend to erode through the wall with time because of their thin profile and an inability of the endoscopic operator to control tension on the suture when it is placed. With the methods and devices of this invention, such an endoscopic suture can be buttressed with a percutaneously placed anchor.
[0195] Although the described methods are focused on the implantation of transgastric fastening assemblies to reduce the volume of the stomach or to increase the resistance to the flow of food in the stomach, the methods and devices can easily be expanded to the implantation of other types of devices such as neurostimulators, gastric muscle stimulators, gastric balloons, and bulking devices inside the wall of a gastrointestinal organ using the percutaneous procedures and devices described herein.
[0196] The methods disclosed herein (e.g. the percutaneous procedure) can further be used to apply an energy source to an internal organ without having to give general anesthesia or pneumoperitoneum. For example, the methods and devices of the current invention can be used to apply radiofrequency probes, microwave probes, ultrasound probes, and radioactive probes (to the serosa) in similar ways as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,872,206. The energy sources can be temporary or permanent and can be activated remotely through the abdominal wall in the case where they are implantable. The methods can further be used for diagnostic purposes prior to performing a surgical therapy. In one example, the methods and devices are used to identify specific nerves or nerve plexuses prior to delivering a specific therapy. In another example, specific hormone producing regions, such as ghrelin, are identified prior to delivering a specific therapy. Following the methods and devices outlined both above and below, instruments can be placed in the abdominal cavity under percutaneous guidance. Any of the layers of the stomach can be accessed and stimulation, ablation, or diagnostic devices can subsequently be placed without anesthesia and without pneumoperitoneum. For example, a stimulation device can be placed in any layer of the stomach wall such as the serosa or muscular layers for example.
