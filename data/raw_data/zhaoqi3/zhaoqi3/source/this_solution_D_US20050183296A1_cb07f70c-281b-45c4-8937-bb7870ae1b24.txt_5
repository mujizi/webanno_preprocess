PRESENTATION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
[0062] With regard to the drawings and references listed above, the attached plans indicate a preferred embodiment of the invention relating to a domestic steam iron which, in its general structure, comprises an ironing element or plate (1) which comes into contact with the garment that is to be ironed, a vaporising component or vaporiser (2) which is provided with water originating from a reservoir incorporated within the iron (by means of a micro-pump, not illustrated) and comprises a vaporisation chamber (3) where the steam is generated, which steam is passed through a front opening (4) of the vaporiser (2) to the plate (1) to emerge into the exterior through holes (17) provided in the plate, and also comprising heat element, of each of the plate (5) and the vaporiser (6), assigned to the plate (1) and the vaporiser (2), thermostatic regulators for each of the temperature of the plate (1) and the vaporiser (2), and thermal fuses for each of the plate (9) and vaporiser (10) associated with the plate (1) and the vaporiser (2).
[0063] This general construction is illustrated in FIG. 1, where an object of the invention (see the details shown in this FIG. 1.) is represented, in which the said vaporisation chamber (3) has a rear outlet (11) that communicates with the front opening (4) of the vaporiser (2) by way of a pair of deep channels (12) that are integrated into the vaporiser (2) and extend along the sides to the vaporisation chamber (3) itself. In this manner, the steam generated in the vaporisation chamber (3) passes from there to the rear outlet (11) and proceeds via both channels (12) co-lateral therewith to end by reaching the front opening (4) and arrive at the plate (1) to be expelled through its holes (17). This solution provides better conditions than those currently known for circulating steam, resulting in reduced possibility of blockages due to accumulation of lime and, finally, a better guarantee of adequate and constant supply of steam for a more efficient ironing process.
[0064] In order better to ensure an absence of lime-scale accumulated in the channels (12), and hence also in the front opening (4), another object of the invention consists (FIGS. 1 and 2) in the said rear outlet (11) of the vaporisation chamber (3) being closed by a fixed mesh (13) and which contains a passage conveniently smaller than the channel sections at the front opening (4) and the said channels (12).
[0065] According to another object of the invention (FIGS. 1 and 3) the said front opening of the vaporiser (2) comprises a tube (14) formed entirely in the vaporiser (2) itself and which can be inserted into a corresponding orifice (15) of the plate (1), of which the tube (14) incorporates an external fixed watertight gasket (16) that acts between the said vaporiser (2) and plate (1), and that is made of a material suitable for the compression procedure as well as for high temperatures. As has been explained previously, this solution envisages the use of a gasket of fluoro-elastomeric material which advantageously is a substitute for another known solution which utilizes a separate brass cap that is inserted simultaneously in the vaporiser (2) and the plate (1), together with the alternating placement of each of the silicone gaskets that behave well at high temperatures but do not work well under compression.
