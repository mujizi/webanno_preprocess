[0043] Subsequently, in a rinsing phase, the washing liquid is pumped out into a wastewater connection by the outflow pump 12. Subsequently, the items of clothing 2 are rinsed, in order to remove the washing liquid from them. For this purpose, fresh water is pumped to the liquid nozzles 8 in a number of rinsing cycles and the water together with the rinsed-out washing liquid is pumped away by the outflow pump 12. The rinsing effect can be intensified if, at the end of each rinsing cycle, the liquid feed to the liquid nozzles 8 is interrupted and the compressed air nozzles 7 are supplied with compressed air. When the items of clothing 2 are moved between the compressed air nozzles 7, they are pressed together by the compressed air jets, whereby the rinsing liquid is squeezed out of them. As such, scarcely any residues of the washing liquid or contaminants remain after the rinsing cycle. As a result, a smaller number of rinsing cycles or less rinsing liquid is required. The air passed to the compressed air nozzles 7 may also be heated in the process, whereby the liquid drawn up from the items of clothing 2 flows out more easily and, consequently, the water removal by compressed air at the end of the rinsing cycles can be intensified.
[0044] The rinsing is followed by a drying and smoothing step. Firstly, the items of clothing 2 are dried to a defined moisture content. For such a purpose, heated air is passed to the hot air nozzles 6. At the same time, the housing rear wall 15 is cooled with fresh water from the fresh water connection. As such, the moisture extracted from the items of clothing 2 condenses on the rear wall 15 and runs into the sump 18, from which it can be pumped away together with the cooling water for the rear wall 15 by the outflow pump 12. In such a case, the air inside the housing 1 is made to circulate, for which purpose the generator 5 draws in the air inside the housing 1.
[0045] Furthermore, there is the possibility of removing moisture from the items of clothing 2 to the desired moisture content based upon the exhaust air principle, in that, air is constantly blown out from the interior of the housing 1 by a blower or fan 14. In this way, the moisture extracted from the items of clothing 2 is discharged, the generator 5 having to draw in air from the outside. However, this method requires the apparatus to be set up in an adequately ventilated room in order to carry away the discharged moisture. The two possibilities, either of condensing the moisture in the apparatus and pumping it away or of discharging it, allow the operator to decide between the two variants in accordance with the respective conditions. The condensing of the moisture in the apparatus has the advantage that the room in which it is set up does not have to be ventilated. As an advantageous result, there is no loss of energy for heating the room in which it is set up, for example, in winter. In summer, on the other hand, the exhaust air variant may be chosen, which does not require any fresh water for cooling the rear wall 15 and less energy for heating the dry air.
[0046] When the desired moisture content has been reached, the smoothing operation can be commenced. For such a purpose, the items of clothing 2 are subjected to hot compressed air with the aid of the compressed air nozzles 7, whereby they are fully dried. In the moist state, the fabric of the items of clothing 2 is still relaxed. As a result, it can be smoothed much better. The smoothing takes place by the force exerted by the compressed air jets from the compressed air nozzles 7 on the items of clothing. This force can be set to a desired effect by setting the pressure of the air passed to the compressed air nozzles 7. In particular, the force is set such that the items of clothing 2 do not flutter, but, instead, the portion of an item of clothing 2 respectively located between the compressed air nozzles 7 is stretched tight.
[0047] For example, the two compressed air nozzles 7 may exert differently distributed surface forces on the items of clothing. As a result, the forces acting on a specific part of an item of clothing 2 from both sides do not cancel one another out. The surface force profiles of the forces exerted by the two compressed air nozzles 7 are, advantageously, complementary to one another. As a result, for example, in the areas in which a high surface force is generated by the left-hand compressed air nozzle 7, a low surface force is generated by the right-hand compressed air nozzle 7, and vice-versa. In this respect, the forces are configured such that the items of clothing are held approximately midway between the two compressed air nozzles 7.
