[0216] During the pre-O/S environment, the hard disk is fully addressable, the BIOS 31 then locks the host protected area 19, and from that point on the drive reports a smaller capacity making the host protected area 19 un-addressable. Only a hardware reset can unlock the host protected area 19 again and enable the whole drive to be addressable again, and this action automatically gives control back to the BIOS 31.
[0217] FIG. 8 illustrates hard disk drive password and host protect area support, and shows how the full hard drive is available during POST (i.e., pre-O/S environment) and then is locked before the operating system is launched.
[0218] This feature was introduced in the ATA-4 industry specification (1998) and provides a convenient way for BIOS firmware functionality to be extended beyond the motherboard's very small flash part, which holds the BIOS code (typically 512K to 1 MB). Unlike the USB device model, this solution is not limited to just a few gigabytes in size, the host protected area 19 can be made to equal any percentage of the original size of the hard disk.
[0219] FIG. 8 also shows how the hard disk interface can be protected with the ATA hard disk password support, which prevents anyone but the user from gaining access to the hard disk data including the host protected area 19. The ATA hard disk password feature locks the hard drive even if it is plugged into another system.
[0220] The host protected area 19 may be combined with hard disk password support, and the on-board Trusted Platform Module 21 to encrypt/decrypt the data. Tying this feature to the secure BIOS 27 provides the ability to `sense` a hardware or software change and take action as defined by a security policy or rule.
