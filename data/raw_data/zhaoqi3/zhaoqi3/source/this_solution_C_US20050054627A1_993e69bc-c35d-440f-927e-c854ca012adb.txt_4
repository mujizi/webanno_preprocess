[0733] Example 3a, Step 6: Benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S,4R)-4-(tert-butyldimethyls-ilyloxy)-2-isopropylcyclohexylamino)-4-(methylthio)-1-oxobutan-2-ylcarbama-te (5.3 g) was dissolved in iodomethane (90 mL), and the resulting solution was stirred at rt for 72 h before being concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in methylene chloride, and the resulting solution was concentrated; this was repeated to afford the salt. MS found: (M+H).sup.+=586.5. This material was dissolved in DMSO (30 mL) and the solution was charged with Cs.sub.2CO.sub.3 (12.7 g). After 6 h, the reaction was partitioned between EtOAc and brine. The organic phase was dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography to afford benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S,4R)-4-hyd-roxy-2-isopropylcyclohexyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-ylcarbamate [580 mg; MS found: (M+H).sup.+=375.3] and benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S,4R)-4-(tert-butyldimet-hylsilyloxy)-2-isopropylcyclohexyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-ylcarbamate [1.0 g; MS found: (M+H).sup.+=489.4].
[0734] Example 3a, Step 7: Benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S,4R)-4-(tert-butyldimethyls-ilyloxy)-2-isopropylcyclohexyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-ylcarbamate (1.0 g) was dissolved in a 4/1/1 mixture of AcOH/THF/H.sub.2O (60 mL). After 72 h, additional 4/1/1 mixture of AcOH/THF/H.sub.2O (30 mL) was added. This solution was stirred an additional 24 h before it was concentrated. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc and washed with saturated NaHCO.sub.3, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to afford benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S,4R)-4-hydroxy-2-isopropylcyclohexyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-ylca-rbamate (750 mg). MS found: (M+H).sup.+=375.3.
[0735] Example 3a, Step 8: Benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S,4R)-4-hydroxy-2-isopropylc-yclohexyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-ylcarbamate (333 mg) was dissolved in CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 (5 mL) and cooled to 0.degree. C. prior to the addition of Dess-Martin reagent (678.9 mg). This solution was warmed to rt over 1 h, and then was cooled to 0.degree. C. prior to the addition of more Dess-Martin reagent (260 mg). After 1 h at rt, the reaction was quenched with Et.sub.2O and 1N NaOH. The organic extracts were combined, washed with saturated Na.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.3 and NaHCO.sub.3 solutions, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered, and concentrated to afford benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S)-2-isopropyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-ylcarbamate (350 mg).

[0736] Example 3a, Step 9: Benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S)-2-isopropyl-4-oxocyclohex-yl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-ylcarbamate (350 mg) was dissolved in Ti(Oi-Pr).sub.4 (2 mL) prior to the addition of iPr(Me)NH (642 mg). After 3 h, this solution was cooled to 0.degree. C. prior to the addition of MeOH (3 mL) and NaBH.sub.4 (66.8 mg). After 1 h at rt, the reaction was quenched with 0.5N NaOH solution and extracted with CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 (2.times.). The organic extracts were combined, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered, and concentrated to a mixture of diastereomers benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S,4R/S)-2-isopropyl-4-(isopropyl(methyl)amino)cyclohexyl)-2-o-xopyrrolidin-3-ylcarbamate (162.4 mg).

[0737] Example 3a, Step 10: Benzyl (S)-1-((1S,2S,4R/S)-2-isopropyl-4-(isop-ropyl(methyl)amino)cyclohexyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-ylcarbamate (160 mg) was dissolved in MeOH (6 mL) prior to the addition of 20% Pd(OH).sub.2 (50 mg) in a Parr bottle. The bottle was evacuated and then back-filled with hydrogen; this was repeated three more times. The reaction was stirred under 60 psi of H.sub.2 for 5 h and then filtered and concentrated. The resulting residue was dissolved in MeOH (6 mL) prior to the addition of 20% Pd(OH).sub.2 (75 mg) in a Parr bottle. The bottle was evacuated and then back-filled with hydrogen; this was repeated three more times. The reaction was stirred under 50 psi of H.sub.2 for 24 h and then filtered and concentrated to provide (S)-3-amino-1-((1S,2S,4R/S)-2-isopropyl-4-(is-opropyl(methyl)amino)cyclohexyl)pyrrolidin-2-one (101 mg).
