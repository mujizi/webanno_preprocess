[0004] Denim is considered to be world's one of the oldest fabric. The popularity of denim fabrics is high in almost every age group. Denim fabrics provide comfort, durability, versatility and glamour. The decolorization of denim fabrics are done by processes such as stone washing, ice washing, sand blasting, rubbing with sand paper or pumice stone etc. Neutralization process using hot water and chemicals, and processes utilizing potassium permanganate spray are also used to provide the desired fading effect.
[0005] U.S. Pat. No. 7,252,688 to Tashiro on Aug. 7, 2007 teaches an apparatus for decolorizing a textile product using ozone. The apparatus enables the decolorization rate to be adjusted by adjusting the water content of the textile product and controlling the ozone concentration to achieve uniform decolorization. The decolorization apparatus includes an airtight container, a rotary drum which rotates in the airtight container, an ozone generator connected with the airtight container through an automatic valve, a water supply unit, and a blower unit which includes an air heater and supplies hot air and cool air to the airtight container. The ozone concentration inside the airtight container is maintained at a desired level by measuring the ozone concentration using an ozone analyzer and controlling the ozone generator. While the particular invention fulfills their is respective objectives, the device lacks an ozone monitoring unit for monitoring the concentration of ozone in ambient for providing safety of operation.
[0006] U.S. Pat. No. 6,024,766 to Wasinger on Feb. 15, 2000 discloses a process of desizing textiles with enzymes together with a subsequent step of deactivating any residual enzymes to prevent degradation of the textiles. There is further provided a step or removal of any residual sizing and/or decolorizing dyed garments with ozone. However, in this process costly enzymes are utilized for decolorizing the fabrics. Moreover, this process also requires chemicals that have high cost and unfriendly to the environment.
[0007] U.S. Pat. No. 5,313,811 to Wasinger on May 24, 1994 discloses an apparatus for laundering and treating garments or fabrics with an oxidizing agent. The apparatus includes a housing having a chamber containing a barrel mounted for rotation. A door is provided for placing the garments or fabrics into the chamber. Associated with the housing is a venturi mixer for introducing an oxidizing gas and a liquid into the chamber and a value for removing liquid from the chamber. Controls are provided to selectively permit a washing, extracting and abrading cycle. However, this device utilizes hot steam for treating the garments thereby wasting a considerable amount of energy.
[0008] Therefore there is a need for an improved apparatus for decolorizing a denim fabric with an oxidizing gas that would have an ozone monitoring unit for monitoring the is concentration of ozone in ambient for providing safety of operation. Such an apparatus would be free from costly enzymes and chemicals that would have high cost and unfriendly to the environment. Moreover, such an apparatus would eliminate the usage of hot steam thereby saving energy. The present invention accomplishes these objectives.
