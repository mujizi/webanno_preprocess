Example 4
This example illustrates preparation of a Ce,Zr mixed-metal-oxide-promoted support according to the method of the present invention using ZrO(NO.sub.3).sub.2 and Ce nitrate (Ce/Zr atom ratio=0.9) in the presence of citric acid where the mole ratio of citric acid to the nitrate salts was 1.9:1.
85.7 grams of ZrO(NO.sub.3).sub.2.XH.sub.2 O (25.7 wt. % Zr) were dissolved in 300 grams of deionized water. 10 grams of conc. nitric acid were also added so as to aid in the dissolution of the Zr nitrate salt. To this solution was added 151 grams of a Ce nitrate stock solution (20 wt. % Ce) followed by 166 grams of anhydrous citric acid. The solution was stirred until all the citric acid was dissolved. 200 grams of .gamma.-Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 were then added slowly to give a uniform slurry, which was milled for 2 minutes and then transferred to a flat ceramic dish. The slurry was dried, then calcined at 600.degree. C. (initially in 4%O.sub.2 /96%N.sub.2 for 6 hours followed by air at 600.degree. C. for 1 hour). After this the powder was aged at 1140.degree. C. for 6 hours in 10%H.sub.2 O/90%N.sub.2.
After drying and calcination as described, a sample was removed from the top and bottom of the cake, aged and then analyzed using X-Ray diffraction (XRD). The CeO.sub.2 lattice parameter for the sample removed from the bottom of the cake was 5.320.+-.0.009 .ANG. and from the top, the lattice parameter was 5.320.+-.0.007 .ANG.. Thus, it appeared that extensive doping of the CeO.sub.2 lattice occurred and there was no evidence for selective wicking of the various metal ions during drying and calcination. The lattice parameters measured correspond to a Zr-doping level of the CeO.sub.2 lattice of 31.3 mole %.
Transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) analysis of an identically prepared powder was carried out after calcination at 600.degree. C. Dispersed CeO.sub.2 particles having an average diameter of 60 .ANG. were observed in both the dark field and bright field transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) analysis of the powder. EDS analysis showed that the Ce and Zr were uniformly distributed throughout the sample, however, it was not possible to determine if solid solution formation had occurred. Aged powders were also sent for transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) analysis. The aging consisted of heating to 1140.degree. C. in 10%H.sub.2 O/90%N.sub.2 for 6 hours. The CeO.sub.2 /ZrO.sub.2 particles had now grown to an average size of over 100 .ANG. and clearer diffraction from the CeO.sub.2 /ZrO.sub.2 particles was observed. The diffraction analysis indicated the formation of a Ce.sub.0.75 Zr.sub.0.25 O.sub.2 phase showing that solid solution formation had occurred between the CeO.sub.2 and ZrO.sub.2.
