[0116] In addition, it was demonstrated using copolymer 18 as an example, that a model hydrophobic molecule Nile Red, could be encapsulated in the nanoparticies.
Nile Red Encapsulation
[0117] 10 mg of copolymer 18 was dissolved in 1 mL of THF. To 0.3 mL of this solution was added 0.5 mg of solid Nile Red followed by a rapid addition of 0.7 mL of deionized water. The resulting solution was mixed thoroughly and then dialyzed against water overnight. A control sample of Nile Red in water was prepared by sonicating 0.5 mg of Nile Red in deionized water. The fluorescence of each sample was obtained on a QM-4 SE spectrofluorometer equipped with double excitation and emission monochromators from Photon Technologies International. An excitation wavelength of 485 inn was used for Nile Red and the emission spectra were recorded from 520 and 700 nm.
[0118] This encapsulation was verified by fluorescence spectroscopy (FIG. 12) as Nile Red has negligible fluorescence in aqueous solution alone, but its fluorescence is known to increase significantly upon incorporation into the hydrophobic interiors of polymer assemblies. FIG. 12 shows that the fluorescence of the hydrophobic dye Nile Red is increased in the presence of nanoparticles assembled from copolymer 18.
[0119] The formation of aqueous dispersions of copolymers 20, 21, and 22, prepared from the high isoprene content (butyl rubber with 7 mol % isoprene units) was also investigated. FIG. 13 shows Z-average sizes of particles formed by copolymers 20, 21, and 22 following aqueous dialysis of a solution of polymer in THF as a function of the percentage of water added rapidly to the THF solution prior to dialysis.
