This is done by combining the metal components of ferrite, titanate or zirconate in the form of organometallic compounds in stoichiometric ratios and mixing them with the thermoplastics, adding the amount of water required for hydrolysis and heating the mixture to above 250.degree. C., preferably from 300.degree. to 400.degree.C.
The sol-gel process is preferably carried out in solution in a high boiling polar organic solvent. For this purpose, the organometallic components are dissolved in the solvent and mixed in the desired stoichiometric ratio, and the mixture is stirred at from 100.degree. to 200.degree. C. for from 1 to 3 hours. Exchange of the radicals bonded to the metals takes place, balancing out the rates of hydrolysis of the metal components.
Thereafter, the polymer is dissolved in this solution in the desired weight ratio. However, it is also possible to dissolve the polymers separately in the same solvent and then to mix the two solutions together.
The hydrolysis is then carried out by adding the stoichiometric amount of water, in the presence or absence of ammonia or an amine as an accelerator, below the boiling point of the solution and with vigorous stirring. In order to avoid flocculation of the resulting gel at the point of dropwise addition, the water is advantageosly diluted with an organic solvent, the solvent present in the reaction mixture preferably being used.
In the subsequent reaction step, the temperature is increased until solvent, and organic residues eliminated during hydrolysis are distilled off. This reaction is preferably carried out under reduced pressure in a stirred kettle or in another unit suitable for devolatilization, such as an extruder, a thin film evaporator or a filmtruder. The temperature is increased to above 250.degree. C., preferably from 300.degree. to 400.degree. C., because temperatures in this range are necessary for the formation of the ferroelectric and/or piezoelectric particles and for their crystallization. The residence time in this temperature range is from 1 to 100, preferably from 3 to 15, minutes.
