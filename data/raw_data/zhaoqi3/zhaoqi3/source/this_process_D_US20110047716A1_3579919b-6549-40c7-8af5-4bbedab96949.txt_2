[0145] A high speed spinning (S752) may be implemented in an initial stage of the first rinsing step, after the washing cycle in the standard course. In the high speed spinning, the drum may be rotated at a higher RPM than the high resonance frequency such that a maximum amount of wash water may be discharged from the laundry. For example, the RPM may be set to be approximately 1000 RPM. The high speed spinning step may continuously rotate the drum at the high speed, that is, approximately 1000 RPM, regardless of the user's selection, so that detergent remnants may be discharged as thoroughly as possible before the rinsing.
[0146] Once the high speed spinning is completed, a first drum driving step (S753) may be implemented to drive the drum after water supplying to rinse the laundry. A rinsing water level may be a relatively high level allowing the water level to be visible through the door, so that the laundry submerged into the wash water. Thus, a significant amount of wash water may be supplied to rinse the laundry in an initial stage of the rinsing cycle.
[0147] A drum driving motion in the first drum driving step may be a scrub and/or swing motion, to move the maximum amount of laundry submerged into the wash water to improve rinsing performance. This scrub and swing motions correspond to a process of continuously hand-scrubbing the laundry under the wash water after submerging the laundry into the wash water. The tumbling and step motions correspond to a process of repeatedly moving the laundry into and out of the wash water. As a result, the first drum driving step may control the drum to be driven in the scrub and/or swing motion, with a high water level, allow the user to visually recognize that enough rinsing is implemented. In alternative embodiments, a circulating step configured to circulate the wash water held in the tub into the drum may be implemented in the first drum driving step. Wash water is sprayed into the drum to rinse the laundry. This process may be referred to as `spray rinsing`. This also displays to a user, as it may be visible through the door, that enough rinsing is implemented.
[0148] Once the first drum driving step is completed, a first draining and intermediate-spinning step (S754) may be implemented. During water draining, the drum may be driven in the step and/or tumbling motion. The laundry is lifted and dropped to improve washing efficiency and bubbles are generated to improve rinsing efficiency. The drum driving motion may be differentiated according to the laundry amount. In the case of a small amount of laundry, the drum is driven in the step motion to generate the maximum distance between the lifting and the dropping. In the case of a large amount of laundry, the drum may be driven in the tumbling motion.
[0149] Intermediate-spinning may be implemented at approximately 100 to 110 RPM in the first draining and intermediate-spinning. Then, the laundry disentangling step, the vibration sensing step and the accelerating step may be omitted and the required time may be noticeably reduced.
