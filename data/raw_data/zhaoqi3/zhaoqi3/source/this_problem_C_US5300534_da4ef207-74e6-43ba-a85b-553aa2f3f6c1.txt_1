As a solution to this problem it is currently envisaged to replace the CFCs by chlorofluorohydrocarbons containing at least one hydrogen atom, such as chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC 22), 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (HCFC 123), 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124), 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC 241b) and 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC 142b). Although the HCFCs exhibit ozone-depletion potentials (O.D.P.) which are markedly lower than those of the CFCs, their O.D.P. is nevertheless not zero and their substitution for the CFCs can therefore represent only a temporary solution.
There is therefore still a need for compounds which have no destructive effect on stratospheric ozone (O.D.P.=0) and exhibit properties which are similar to those of CFCs 11, 12 and 113, in order to replace the latter as blowing agents and insulating gases in the manufacture of plastic foams.
It has now been found that this problem can be solved by employing vinylfluoroalkane of formula:
CH.sub.2 .dbd.CH--C.sub.n F.sub.2n+1
in which C.sub.n F.sub.2n+1 denotes a linear or branched perfluoroalkyl radical and n is an integer from 1 to 6. These compounds have ODP of zero; the properties of the preferred compounds are illustrated by the following table.
