With a top rail channel member 22 laid on one of its sides 26 on the lower level table deck 144 and extending the full length of the plurality of sections 11 thus laid together and with the posts 10 serving as spacers, a pusher wall or beam 154 is brought into abutment with the top transverse wall 32 of the element 22. Upon further moving in the direction of the arrow 156 for a distance equal to distance d in FIG. 14, the pusher beam 154 will shift the channel element 22 relative to the upper notched ends 83 of the pickets and the locking cover plates 40 into which such pickets ends 83 have been inserted, and will almost simultaneously snap-lock the upper notched ends 83 of the pickets between the channel members 50 by the projection 54 entering the picket notches 84, while causing the arcuate sidewalls 46b of the plates 40 to pass between the oppositely facing edges 24a of the bent over portions 24 of the sidewalls 26 of the top rail channel element 22. When such movement is completed, the joinder of the cover plate locking element 40 with the channel element 22 will be accomplished in the manner heretofore described under the heading "Interfitting of Assembly Components". In addition, at about the same instant the lower notched ends 83a of the pickets 20 are forced between the flanges 66 to where the angular edges 74 enter the notches 86 thereby locking such ends in the bottom channel members 60.
However, since the posts 10 are not held in position by the wall 148 or any other immovable object, interfitting of the posts 10 with both the top rail assembly 14 and the bottom rail assembly 18 is not accomplished at this time. Such interfitting may be effected after the pusher beam 154 has moved from the dotted line position shown in FIG. 15 to its solid line position in abutment with the top rail channel element 22 with which the cover locking plate 40 and the picket ends have now been securely interfitted. In this disposition of the thus far complete railing assembly, the pistons or pushers 152 are now advanced in the direction of the arrows 158 in FIG. 15 to where they first come into contact with the lower flared ends 90b of the post 10. As previously mentioned, these posts have already had manually inserted in their upper ends 90d their U-shaped locking caps 100, each with a wedge 108 also manually driven into the cap 100 to secure the latter in such upper post end. As the pushers or pistons 152 advance further in the direction of the arrows 158, the arcuate sidewalls of the upper extremities 109 of the capping element 100 will be forced between the sidewalls 26 of the top rail channel element 22 to lock the same in the channel member 22 in the manner illustrated in FIG. 4 and hereinabove discussed in connection with that figure. Simultaneously, however, the adapters 96 are forced into the bottom rail channel elements 60 to become locked therein, also as illustrated in FIG. 4 and heretofore discussed in connection with that figure. Thereupon, a complete long railing assembly section consisting, for example, of four railing sections 11 and three mounting posts 10 may be seen to have been permanently assembled for shipment to the construction site where the railing assembly is to be installed. Labor and materials costs for such railing assembly and installation will be found to be substantially less than has been required for prior art railing assemblies.
An alternative apparatus for and method of assembling long sections of railing assemblies 11 is illustrated in FIG. 17. In this method, a plurality of short railing sections 11, each consisting of pickets 20 with their ends 83, 83a inserted in a locking cover plate 40 and a bottom rail channel element 60, and separated by spacers 13 corresponding in width to the posts, are aligned with the plate 40 adjacent a top rail element 22. The interfitting of the plates 40 and channel element 22 are accomplished by a rolling motion relative to the element 22, the element 60, or both. After the element 22 has been secured into the bottom cover locking plate 40 with its inserted picket ends 83a, the spacers 13 are removed and capped posts 10 are brought into the voids created by the removal of the spacers 13. The posts 10 are then interfitted by pressure with both the element 22 and the bottom channel element 60 in the manner heretofore discussed.
While the present invention has been particularly illustrated and described in conjunction with embodiments involving railing systems, the principles of this invention, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, may be applied to erecting any kind of grid which includes spaced parallel members interconnected by a plurality of transverse elements. Thus, for example, one could erect wall studding by utilizing essentially the same basic interfitting elements as, for example: providing a floor stringer similar to a bottom rail assembly 18, a parallel beam for ceiling attachment corresponding to the top rail assembly 14, end posts similar to the posts 10 or 10a, the interstitial studding corresponding to the pickets 20. In this manner, wall studding could be prefabricated and shipped to a building site where an entire studding wall could be put up and installed in a matter of minutes thereby to greatly reduce building costs.
Thus, it may be seen that the present invention offers many advantages over prior art devices.
