[0036] As supported above, one non-limiting aspect of the present invention relates to an interactive television strategy of enhancing a program presenting an associated user experience on a so-called 2nd screen, such as a PC or mobile device such that the 2nd screen presentation is synchronized with a corresponding television presentation. One non-limiting aspect of the present invention provides a mechanism to deliver application assets and signals to a secondary device to enable accurate synchronization of a 2nd screen application to a television program. Because of the inherent latencies in TV transmission and presentation, synchronization signals may be generated by the TV receiver in a viewer's home and transmitted to the secondary device over the Internet. While this incurs some latency in signal transmission, the latency may be tolerably small and consistent for almost all applications.
[0037] One non-limiting aspect of the present invention relates to an application on a TV receiver is alerted when a signal embedded in a programming stream is encountered. This application in turn sends a signal upstream. A server hosted by a service operator or application provider receives the signal from the TV receiver and in turn sends one or more messages to the secondary device. The receipt of these messages by an application on the secondary device enables the application to maintain synchronization with the television program. These messages might also contain application assets, in the form of executable code, data, or other. In this way, EBIF or other applications could be supported on the secondary device.
[0038] This method may be used to enable another sort of synchronization to programming, in addition to temporal synchronization. Because application signaling and asset distribution to a secondary device may be initiated by the TV receiver or headend aware of tuning prior to the tuning actually taking place, and hence what a viewer is currently watching on TV, applications on the secondary device can be synchronized to the TV experience in terms of content as well. Instead of launching a `Lost` of other television program specific application on an iPad after tuning into the show, an iPad app could simply detect, through this method, that `Lost` is on and present the appropriate user experience.
[0039] As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale, some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for the claims and/or as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention. The features of various implementing embodiments may be combined to form further embodiments of the invention.
[0040] While exemplary embodiments are described above, it is not intended that these embodiments describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Additionally, the features of various implementing embodiments may be combined to form further embodiments of the invention.
