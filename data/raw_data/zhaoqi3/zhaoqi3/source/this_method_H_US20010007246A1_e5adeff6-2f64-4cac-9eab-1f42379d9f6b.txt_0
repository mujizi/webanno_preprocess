[0012] It is also possible to measure the substrate temperature by a thermocouple. However, in many cases, it is impossible to make the thermocouple contact with the substrate. The thermocouple is not suitable for high-accuracy temperature measurement. Especially, when the substrate is placed in a vacuum, the measurement accuracy of the thermocouple decreases, resulting from that temperature difference may occur at the contact points of the substrate and the thermocouple because the atmospheric temperature equalization by the convection cannot be expected.
[0013] In addition, the radiation heating has an essential problem in the solar cell manufacturing. In structure of solar cells, at least one side of a photovoltaic layer needs an optical transparent electrode. For example, in the manufacture of amorphous silicon solar cells, the amorphous silicon film is often deposited on a TCO (Transparent Conductive Oxide) film formed on the substrate. Here, what is problem is that the TCO film has a characteristic of high infrared-ray reflectivity. Therefore, it is essentially impossible to heat the substrate having the TCO film on it by means of the radiation heating with enough efficiency.
[0014] Other than the radiation heating, there is a method utilizing the heat conduction. In this method, a plate with high thermal conductivity is made contact with the substrate at its backside. This plate is hereinafter called "backing plate". When the backing plate is heated, the substrate is heated through heat transfer by the conduction from the backing plate to the substrate. However, this method cannot be employed in case the backing plate is not used considering the energy-payback-time reduction. In addition, it is difficult to make the baking plate contact with the substrate sufficiently and uniformly. This brings disadvantage that highly efficient and uniform heating is impossible to the backing plate method.
[0015] In addition, by the backing plate method, the substrate is heated only from its backside. As a result, temperature difference in the direction along the substrate thickness easily occurs with thick substrates. Worse, the substrate may suffer a thermal deformation before it is heated up to a required temperature.
[0016] There may be another method where the substrate is heated from both sides by radiation. Even if this method is adopted, it is difficult to keep a balance of heating from both sides because the TCO film that hardly absorbs infrared rays exists on one side of the substrate. Particularly, if this method is carried out placing the substrate under a vacuum pressure, it is almost impossible to heat the substrate from both sides because heat transfer by the convection and the conduction cannot be expected.
