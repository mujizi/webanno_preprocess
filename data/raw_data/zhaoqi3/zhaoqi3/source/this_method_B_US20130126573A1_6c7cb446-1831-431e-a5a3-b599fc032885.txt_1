[0062] FIG. 6 presents an example of a focusing arrangement for delivering multiple converging laser beams into a transparent plate for creating multiple filaments simultaneously. The beams 10 and 34 maybe separated from a single laser source using well know beam splitter devices and focused with separate lenses 12 and 36 as shown. Alternatively, diffractive optics, multi-lens systems and hybrid beam splitting and focusing systems may be employed in arrangements well known to an optical practitioner to create the multiple converging beams that enter the plate at different physical positions, directions, angles, and depths. In this way, filamentation modification tracks 18 are created in parallel in straight or curvilinear paths such that multiple parts of the plate can be laser written at the same time and subsequently scribed along the multiple modification tracks for higher overall processing speed.
[0063] FIG. 7 presents a schematic arrangement for two different focusing conditions for laser filamentation writing that confines the array 38 of modification tracks 40 solely in a top transparent substrate 42 (FIG. 7(a)) as a first laser exposure step, and followed sequentially by filamentation writing that solely confines the array 44 of modification tracks 46 inside a lower transparent plate 48 (FIG. 7(b)) in a second laser pass. The laser exposure is tuned to avoid ablation or other laser damage and generation of ablation debris on any of the four surfaces during each laser pass. During scribing of the top plate, no damage occurs in the bottom layer, and visa versa.
[0064] One advantage of this one-sided processing is that the assembly of transparent plates does not need to be flipped over to access the second plate 48 due to the transparency of the first plate to the converging laser beam 50. For example, by position the 12 lens closer to the top glass plate 42 in the second pass (FIG. 7b), the filamentation is not initiated in the first plate and near full laser energy enters the second plate where filamentation is then initiated. A second advantage of this approach is that the two plates can be separated along similar lines during the same scribing step which is attractive particularly for assembled transparent plates in flat panel display. This method is extensible to multiple transparent plates.
[0065] FIG. 7(c) shows an arrangement for inducing laser filamentation simultaneously in two or more transparent plates 42 and 48. This method enables a single pass exposure of both transparent plates to form near-identical shapes or paths of the filamentation modification tracks 38 and 44. In this case, laser parameters are adjusted to create a first filament 38 or array of filament tracks 40 within the top plate 42, such that the filamentation terminates prior to reaching the bottom surface of the top plate, for example, by plasma de-focusing. The diverging laser beam is sufficiently expanded after forming the first filament track to prevent ablation, optical breakdown, or other damage to bottom surface of the top plate, the medium between the two plates, and the top surface of the bottom plate 48.
[0066] However, during propagation in this region, self focusing persists and results in the creation of a second filament 44 that is confined solely in the bottom layer transparent plate 48. As such, a single laser beam simultaneously forms two or more separated filaments 38 and 44 that create parallel modification tracks 40 and 46 in two or more stacked plates at the same time. In this way, an assembly of two or more transparent plates can by scribed or separated along the near-parallel filamentation tracks and through all transparent plates in one cleaving step. The medium between the transparent plates must have good transparency and may consist of air, gas vacuum, liquid, solid or combination thereof. Alternatively, the transparent plates may be in physical or near-physical contact without any spacing. This method is extensible to filament processing in multiply stacked transparent plates.
