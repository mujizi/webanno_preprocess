[0456] The solution provided by U.S. Pat. No. 4,361,153 is " . . . achieved by the use of a resonant impedance modulated transponder in the implant to modulate the phase of a relatively high energy reflected magnetic carrier imposed from outside of the body." In particular, and as is described by claim 1 of this patent, there is claimed "An apparatus for communicating variable information to an external device from an electronic stimulator implanted in a living human patient, comprising an external unit including means for transmitting a carrier signal, a hermetically sealed fully implantable enclosure adapted to be implanted at a fixed location in the patient's body, means within said enclosure for generating stimulator outputs, a transponder within said enclosure including tuned resonant circuit means for resonating at the frequency of said carrier signal so as to re-radiate a signal at the frequency of said carrier signal, and means for superimposing an information signal on the reflected signal by altering the resonance of said tuned circuit means in accordance with an information signal, said superimposing means including a variable impedance load connected across said tuned circuit and means for varying the impedance of said load in accordance with an information signal, said external unit further including pickup means for receiving the reflected signal from said transponder and means for recovering the information signal superimposed thereon, said receiving means including means reponsive to said reflected signal from said transponder for producing on associated analog output signal, and said recovering means including phase shift detector means responsive to said analog output signal for producing an output signal related to the relative phase angle thereof."
[0457] U.S. Pat. No. 4,408,607 discloses a rechargeable, implantable capacitive energy source; the entire disclosure of this patent is hereby incorporated into this specification by reference; and this source may be used to directly or indirectly supply energy to one or more of the anti-mitotic compounds of this invention, and/or tubulin and/or microtubules and/or other moieties. As is disclosed in column 1 of such patent (at lines 12 et seq.), "Medical science has advanced to the point where it is possible to implant directly within living bodies electrical devices necessary or advantageous to the welfare of individual patients. A problem with such devices is how to supply the electrical energy necessary for their continued operation. The devices are, of course, designed to require a minimum of electrical energy, so that extended operation from batteries may be possible. Lithium batteries and other primary, non-rechargeable cells may be used, but they are expensive and require replacement of surgical procedures. Nickel-cadmium and other rechargeable batteries are also available, but have limited charge-recharge characteristics, require long intervals for recharging, and release gas during the charging process."
[0458] The solution to this problem is described, e.g., in claim 1 of the patent, which describes "An electric power supply for providing electrical energy to an electrically operated medical device comprising: capacitor means for accommodating an electric charge; first means providing a regulated source of unidirectional electrical energy; second means connecting said first means to said capacitor means for supplying charging current to said capacitor means at a first voltage which increases with charge in the capacitor means; third means deriving from said first means a comparison second voltage of constant magnitude; comparator means operative when said first voltage reaches a first value to reduce said first voltage to a second, lower value; and voltage regulator means connected to said capacitor means and medical device to limit the voltage supplied to the medical device."
[0459] U.S. Pat. No. 4,416,283 discloses a implantable shunted coil telemetry transponder employed as a magnetic pulse transducer for receiving externally transmitted data; the entire disclosure of this United States patent is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. This transponder may be used in a manner similar to that of the aforementioned telemetry system.
[0460] In particular, a programming system for a biomedical implant is described in claim 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,416,283. Such claim 1 discloses "In a programming system for a biomedical implant of the type wherein an external programmer produces a series of magnetic impulses which are received and transduced to form a corresponding electrical pulse input to programmable parameter data registers inside the implant, wherein the improvement comprises external programming pulse receiving and transducing circuitry in the implant including a tuned coil, means responsive to pairs of successive voltage spikes of opposite polarity magnetically induced across said tuned coil by said magnetic impulses for forming corresponding binary pulses duplicating said externally generated magnetic impulses giving rise to said spikes, and means for outputting said binary pulses to said data registers to accomplish programming of the implant."
