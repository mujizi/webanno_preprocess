[0041] Also, a variety of other sensors, whether commercially available or not including those not yet developed, could be used within the system disclosed herein. While novel sensor units comprising various sensors are disclosed herein, other novel aspects of the present disclosure remain novel regardless of the form of sensor units. With regard to monitoring of gases such as air, any suitable sensor for detecting a target species can be used, such as, for example, electrochemical gas sensors including electrochemical sensors for detecting hydrogen cyanide as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,074,539, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Exemplary Monitor, Confirm and Report Systems
[0042] In one embodiment of the present disclosure shown in FIG. 1A, a system for monitoring water quality (or quality of any fluid) (330 in FIG. 3) can include a sensor unit 110 that includes a first sensor 111A and an associated processing unit 112A acting as a monitoring means for monitoring a fluid and generating a variable based on the content of a fluid. This processing unit 112A can be housed in a module 112 along with a communication unit 112B. This first sensor 111A either upon the detection of a quality in the fluid or by the measured or calculated variable associated with the fluid crossing a threshold, for instance, can generate a preliminary identifier if the variable is indicative of a detection condition. For instance, if the pH level (as the variable) or other water quality parameter rises too high or low, or the water pressure as measured by an incorporated pressure monitor drops below a threshold for instance, a preliminary identifier (e.g., a flag or a signal) is generated in this exemplary system. This preliminary identifier can trigger a second sensor 111B to begin measuring the same variable or a different variable, or to output a continuously measured result. The processing unit 112A can comprise a single processing unit or multiple processing units.
[0043] Alternatively, the second sensor 111B can be run in tandem with the first sensor 111A for testing the same sample of fluid a second time either using the same test or a different test that also is indicative of a detection condition. The results of the measures or tests are output from the processor as a confirmed result when they agree. The second sensor 111B and the processing unit 112A act as a confirming means for the first sensor or monitoring means 111A.
[0044] Alternatively, the second sensor 111B can be in the form of the first sensor 111A that is recalibrated for the second test.
