[0542] In one embodiment, one or more adiponectin isoforms or glycoisoforms or adiponectin agonist polypeptides is prepared by recombinant methods. Adiponectin or adiponectin agonist polypeptides may be produced recombinantly by inserting a polynucleotide (usually DNA) sequence that encodes the protein into an expression vector and expressing the peptide in an appropriate host. A polynucleotide encoding the desired polypeptide, whether in fused or mature form, and whether or not containing a signal sequence to permit secretion, may be ligated into expression vectors suitable for any convenient host. Any of a variety of expression vectors known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be employed, although eukaryotic expression systems are recommended because of the ability of eukaryotic cells to perform post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation. Expression may be achieved in any appropriate host cell that has been transformed or transfected with an expression vector containing a DNA molecule which encodes the recombinant peptides. Examples of eukaryotic host cells are known in the art and include yeast, avian, insect, plant, and animal cells such as COS7, HeLa, CHO and other mammalian cells. Standard techniques for recombinant production are described for example, in Sambrook supra. Adiponectin or adiponectin agonist polypeptides can be obtained by expression of a recombinant polynucleotide encoding adiponectin or a polypeptide having the sequence of any of those animals (e.g., human, mouse, etc.) described in FIG. 5 or a biologically active fragment or addition thereof, or other variant or agonist thereof in mammalian cells.
[0543] In another embodiment, adiponectin (including mixtures of isoforms and glycoisoforms) can also be purified from an animal tissue such as, but not limited to, serum or adipocytes. Methods for purifying adiponectin from adipocytes are well-known in the art and further described in the Examples. The animals from which the composition of glycosylated adiponectin can be obtained include but are not limited to humans, mice, rats, dogs, bovines, and non-human primates.
[0544] Adiponectin, obtained either recombinantly or from animal tissues, can be separated on the basis of molecular weight, pI, and/or the amount of glycosylation present within the adiponectin polypeptide by routine methods, e.g., electrophoresis or chromatography as disclosed in the Examples. In one aspect of the invention, adiponectin compositions containing specified isoforms or glycoisoforms of adiponectin, e.g., as described above, are prepared by differential purification. For example, according to a method of the invention, this involves obtaining a first composition containing at least two forms of adiponectin that differ in their degree or type of glycosylation and then separating the adiponectin forms based on the degree or tripe of glycosylation. This method produces a second composition that differs from the first composition in the adiponectin profile.
[0545] Glycosylated adiponectin polypeptide can be separated from other polypeptides by several methods known in the protein purification art. In one embodiment, the separation is effected by two-dimensional electrophoresis and subsequent excision and elution of the protein from the gel. In another embodiment, the separation is effected by using an affinity column which selects on the basis of electrical charge. In another embodiment, the separation is effected by using an affinity column loaded with lectins. In other embodiments, alternate protein purification methods are used, e.g., immunoaffinity column, size-exclusion column, lectin affinity, hydrophobic interaction, reversed phase, anion and cation exchange chromatography, and the like (see, generally, R. Scopes, Protein Purification, Springer-Verlag, N.Y. (1982) and Deutscher, Methods in Enzymology Vol. 182: Guide to Protein Purification, Academic Press, Inc. N.Y. (1990)).
[0546] In one embodiment, compositions containing predominantly glycosylated adiponectin polypeptides are obtained by using a lectin column, for example, a concanavalin A or wheat germ agglutinin column, to bind glycosylated adiponectin polypeptides. Non-glycosylated adiponectin will not bind to the column and thus, will flow through the column. The glycosylated adiponectin polypeptides are then eluted from the column to obtain a composition containing predominantly glycosylated adiponectin polypeptides.
