[0277] Phase IV illustrated in FIG. 17c initiates the formation of the undercut, where solvent injection and fluid circulation are started. The solvent (water or unsaturated solution) is injected in either or both of two unlined boreholes A, B where it then contacts and dissolves trona forming the walls of the horizontal borehole portions 810, 820, thus enlarging them. This generates greater flow area and exposes a greater perimeter or contact surface of the trona. The undercut begins forming by utilizing the natural tendency of the shale beds to restrict the dissolution of the trona, resulting in dissolving the trona surfaces in the lower region of the bed. A pregnant solution flows through the unlined portions 810 and 820 and the side branches connecting portions 810 and 820 to 835 dissolving along the way more trona to finally flow into unlined portion 835. A saturated solution is collected at the downhole end of the third borehole C, to be passed to surface via a downhole pump.
[0278] The system may be operated under pressure allowing the surrounding rock to maintain or exert a pressure to the local strata minimizing any local ground pressures. The pressure on the surrounding rock may be exerted by liquid, or exerted by gas by utilizing injection of air or some natural ground gas in the undercut cavity. The temperature, flow rates of the solvent and the density of the resulting solution are monitored to obtain the saturation of the return solution.
[0279] Overall this method does not retain any drill piping into the various borehole horizontal portions and branches created by directional drilling, but the cavity development and placement may be effectively provided to desired areas through the use of tailings to direct flows and varying flow rates, temperature and saturation levels of the injected solvent. The tailings may also act to form a barrier from the shale floor and contaminants falling from the upper areas of the bed, keeping liquid from contamination by the shale layer. The solvent thus may include tailings which then deposit on the bottom face of the undercut. Deposited tailings change flow paths through damming effects and direct the solvent flow to inward cavities created by directional drilling.
[0280] During Phase V as shown in FIG. 17d, the undercut formation has progressed as trona continues to create a larger cavity in and around the main horizontal borehole portions 810, 820 and their respective side branches, as well as around the main horizontal return borehole portion 835 and its side branches. High flow rates and low solvent temperature minimize the dissolution of the trona near the injection points and enable undercut to develop at areas alongside the unlined borehole portions 810, 820 and/or near the return borehole portion 835, so that erosion by dissolution of the walls of unlined portions occurs all the way down toward the return borehole C. During phase VI as shown in FIG. 17e, the undercut and secondary areas extended beyond the initial unlined borehole portions are becoming more developed. The use of tailings can be carried out to cover fallen shale bed parts and organic contamination from floors. The tailings mixed with solvent, settle and form a blanket keeping the unsaturated and saturated fluids from contacting the caved shale. During phase VII as shown in FIG. 17f, the undercut develops vertically as lower regions of the bed have been dissolved and part of the trona overburden cracks and falls into the undercut. Surface subsidence monitoring can be used to determine extents and impacts of pillar erosion (pillars here being defined as the non-eroded ore regions between boreholes).
[0281] FIG. 17 g illustrates the vertical progression of the undercut formation, where in Phases IV and V, the immediate lower and upper regions of trona surrounding the initial borehole portions 810, 820 are dissolving away. During subsequent undercut formation phases VI to VII, however, as solvent starts eroding trona on the upper face of the undercut, the undercut is further enlarged upwards.
