[0075] where Vsd, Vsq, Isd, Isq are obtained by measuring the three stator voltages (V_L.sub.1, V_L2, V_L3) (216) and the three stator currents (I_L1, I_L2, I_L3) (118), and referring these voltages and currents to a two axes rotational system, using the .mu. rotational angle.
[0076] Both current regulator outputs, Sp_Urd and Sp_Urq, are transformed into a fixed system, using the rotating angle (.mu.-.epsilon.), obtaining the three voltage references to be imposed in the rotor (211) of the doubly fed induction generator (205). Block 414 shows the transformation of the rotor voltages, from a two axes rotational system to a three phase fixed system. In one embodiment, these rotor voltages may be used as reference to a module for generating the triggering of the active switches of the power electronic converter (222). Block 415 shows the module where different PWM techniques may be implemented.
[0077] According to this embodiment, an electronic power control system based on two power loops and two current loops, independent on the machine electrical parameters, avoids the effects of the electrical parameter dispersion or the theoretical modeling errors in the power regulation. Errors caused by the electrical parameters change because of temperature oscillations or saturation effects due to the non linearity and are avoided by this method. Thus, a very good quality energy generation is obtained, fulfilling and improving the requirements of the different normative. Only different measurements are necessary to make the regulation (I_L1, I_L2, I_L3, V_L.sub.1, V_L2,_L3, Ir_L1, Ir_L2, Ir_L3, .epsilon., .omega.). In one embodiment, the reactive power regulation could be made independent of the active power regulation.
Exciter Controller
[0078] In one exemplary embodiment, the variable speed system comprises a doubly fed induction generator (205) wherein the rotor (211) is connected to an electronic power converter (222). This electronic power converter is coupled through a DC Bus system (224) to a second electronic power converter (225). In one embodiment, this frequency converter (power converter) (225) is connected by contactor (228) to the exciter machine (212). The exciter machine, such as an asynchronous machine, a DC machine or a synchronous (e.g. permanent magnet) machine or a reversible electrical machine, is mechanically coupled to the drive train.
