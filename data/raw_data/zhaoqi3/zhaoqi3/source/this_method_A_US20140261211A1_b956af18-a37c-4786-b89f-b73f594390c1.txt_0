[0121] One convenient method of magnetically linking brush plate 120 to ring 116 that is enabled by the positioning of magnets 127, 127 of ring 116 first comprises linking brush plate 120 to ring 116 with brush plate 120 oriented downwardly, such that ring 116 with the attached plate 120 float in a food containing position within aquarium 130, after which handle 112 is conveniently magnetically linked thereto. This is often more convenient than first linking brush plate 120 to handle 112, then linking ring 116 to brush plate 120 because ring 116 floats in a food containing position with plate 120 thereon and because of the increased gripping surface of the ring 116, which can be conveniently held while linking handle 112 to brush plate 120 on opposing sides of a panel of aquarium 130.
[0122] Once floating food within container 114 is soaked, as illustrated in FIG. 15, the soaked food is less sharp for the mouths of fish and is thus better for eating by the fish. In order to completely cause the floating food to move out of container 114, container 114 can then be moved completely below the water level, as shown in FIG. 15A or FIG. 16, allowing the soaked food to float out of container 114. This lowering of container 114 can be performed by (i) moving handle member 112 downwardly such that container 114 and ring 116 both move lower such that container 114 extends below the water level, as shown in FIG. 15A; or (ii) by moving container 114 with respect to ring 116 (e.g., by manually moving container 114), as illustrated in FIG. 16.
[0123] FIG. 16 demonstrates the fish food dispensing assembly 110 of FIGS. 13, 14, and 15, wherein the perforated container has been moved further downward into the water and wherein the soaked floating food has been moved by the fluid in the aquarium from the perforated container to the top of the fluid in the aquarium. According to this method of dispensing food, floating food is first soaked in the perforated container 114 as shown in FIG. 15 (soaked food being softer and therefore better for the mouths of the fish), then the perforated container 114 is moved further into the liquid such that the floating food exists the top of the perforated container, as illustrated in FIG. 16. Optionally, as illustrated in FIG. 15A, once assembly 110 is in the position of FIG. 15, after the food 132 is soaked, the entire assembly 110 can be moved downward by moving handle 112, such that perforated container 114 is moved completely below the water level, and such that soaked floating food 132 will float out of the top of container 114.
[0124] As illustrated in FIG. 16, containment ring contains floating fish food 132 in a selected position within aquarium 130, substantially preventing the fish food 132 from moving to unselected, random locations of the aquarium 130 and substantially ensuring that the areas where the containment ring is not located, are less likely to become dirty or soiled or receive a film of fish food thereon.
[0125] Lid 118 can optionally be placed on containment ring 116 in connection with the use of sinking fish food 132a, as discussed in connection with FIGS. 17 and 18.
