This invention is based on the synthesis of novel maytansinoid derivatives that retain high cytotoxicity and that can be effectively linked to cell binding agents. The art reveals that it is extremely difficult to modify existing drugs without diminishing their cytotoxic potential. The disclosed invention overcomes this problem by modifying the disclosed maytansinoid derivatives with chemical moieties, especially ones containing thiol or disulfide groups, to which appropriate cell binding agents can be linked. As a result, the disclosed novel maytansinoid derivatives preserve and in some cases even enhance the cytotoxic potency of the naturally occurring maytansinoids. The cell binding agent-maytansinoid derivative conjugates permit the full measure of the cytotoxic action of the maytansinoid derivatives to be applied in a targeted fashion against unwanted cells only, therefore, avoiding side effects due to damage to non-targeted healthy cells. This invention permits the maytansinoid derivatives to live up to their potential, something their undirected cytotoxic effects had previously made impossible. Thus the invention provides useful agents for the elimination of diseased or abnormal cells that are to be killed or lysed such as tumor cells (particularly solid tumor cells), virus infected cells, microorganism infected cells, parasite infected cells, autoimmune cells (cells that produce autoantibodies), activated cells (those involved in graft rejection or graft vs. host disease), or any other type of diseased or abnormal cells, while exhibiting a minimum of side effects.
Thus, this invention teaches the synthesis of maytansinoid derivatives that can be chemically linked to a cell binding agent while keeping a high cytotoxicity either in bound form or in released form or in both states. High cytotoxicity is defined as exhibiting a toxicity having an IC.sub.50 --the inhibiting concentration of a toxic substance that leaves a surviving fraction of 0.5--of about 10.sup.-8 M or less when measured in vitro with KB cells upon a 24 hour exposure time to the drug.
