[0005] In any case, it may be necessary to provide large area and high fill factor arrays whose pixels have to be individually addressable by using suitable independent driving and readout circuits for each pixel of the array. The larger the number of pixels in the array, the higher the dynamic range and consequently the more accurate the spatial information provided by the whole photodetector. Moreover, the greater the whole dimension and the geometrical fill factor of the array, the greater its sensitivity.
[0006] In typical semiconductor fabrication systems, chips are built up in large numbers on a single large "wafer" of semiconductor material, typically silicon. The individual chips are patterned with small pads of metal (usually near their edges) that serve as the connections to an eventual mechanical carrier. The chips are then cut out of the wafer and attached to their carriers, typically with small wires (wire bonding). These wires eventually lead to pins on the outside of the carriers, which are attached to the rest of the circuitry making up the electronic system. It may be necessary to connect each pixel in the array to appropriate external circuitry such that for arrays with a high number of pixels it may be practically impossible to use the wire bonding for the packaging.
[0007] A possible approach to overcome this problem could be to use a Chip Scale Package (CSP), which is a single-die, direct surface mountable package with an area of no more than 1.2 times the original die area. The advantages offered by chip scale packages include smaller size (reduced footprint and thickness), lesser weight, an relatively easier assembly process, lower over-all production costs, and an improvement in electrical performance. CSPs are also tolerant of die size changes, since a reduced die size can still be accommodated by the interposer design without changing the CSPs footprint.
[0008] Chip scale packaging can combine the advantages of various packaging technologies, such as the size and performance advantage of bare die assembly and the reliability of encapsulated devices. The significant size and weight reduction offered by the CSP makes it ideal for use in mobile devices like cell phones, laptops, palmtops, and digital cameras.
[0009] Another possible approach is to use Through Silicon Vias (TSV) technology for the integration of the detector with the electronics. TSV is a vertical electrical connection (via) passing completely through a silicon wafer or die. In this case, the detector die and the electronics chips are vertically stacked and the contacts from the topside of the detector are carried out through the vias to the backside of the die and then suitably soldered to the driving and readout circuitry.
