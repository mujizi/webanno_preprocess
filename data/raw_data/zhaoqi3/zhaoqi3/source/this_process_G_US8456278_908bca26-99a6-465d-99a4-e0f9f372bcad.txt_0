If that sensor-transmitter just enrolled into the integration device is not the last of the existing sensor-transmitters 102 to be enrolled, as indicated by the decision node 412, then the enrollment process does not end, but rather proceeds to enroll the next sensor-transmitter. As such, the process 400 proceeds to step 402 in the event that the next sensor-transmitter is of a device type that is different from that of the sensor-transmitter just enrolled. If the device type is the same, however, as indicated by decision node 414, the process 400 instead proceeds directly to step 404. After all of the existing sensor-transmitters 102 are enrolled in the integration device, as indicated by decision node 412, the process 400 of enrollment in the integration device is complete, and enrollment of sensor-transmitters into the system control device may be done.
In alternative implementations, sensor-transmitters may be enrolled into the integration device by a user entering an ID number for the sensor-transmitter that may be printed on the sensor-transmitter for example, or by scanning a bar code that may be on the sensor transmitter. In such a case, an entry into the enrollment memory for the sensor-transmitter may be made using this ID code, and in addition, the entry may include any device type and other information about the sensor-transmitter that is received by the integration device. As such, the sensor-transmitter need not make a transmission in order to get enrolled, in some implementations.
Turning now to FIG. 4B, a flowchart shows a process 420 that may be carried out to enroll sensor-transmitters Protocol #1 and Protocol #2 sensor-transmitters into a system control device, for example, the system control device 106 in the FIG. 1 implementation. This process covers enrollment both of existing sensor-transmitters 102 that utilize for example Protocol #1 (FIG. 2A), and new or expansion sensors 104 that utilize for example Protocol #2 (FIG. 2B). As with the enrollment process at the integration device, the enrollment process at the system control device involves all of the sensor-transmitters that are to be a part of the wireless security system, and the enrollment process may be done one sensor-transmitter at a time.
The process 420 begins at step 422, wherein the system control device is put into a program mode which enables sensor-transmitters to be enrolled into the system control device. This may be done by a user putting the system control device into a program mode using a user interface component associated with the system control device.
Next, the process 420 proceeds to step 424, wherein a sensor-transmitter to be enrolled is triggered to transmit a transmission (for example, a predetermined transmission) that causes the sensor-transmitter to be enrolled. This may be done using a predetermined transmission type that is understood by the system control device to be a transmission for enrollment. This predetermined transmission may be a tamper transmission, wherein a tamper bit (for example, the state and latch bits for F3) in the transmission is set high. Other predetermined transmissions are also possible, for example, a power-up transmission in the case of existing sensor-transmitters that are configured to provide such transmissions, or any other transmission of that nature (for example, a double trip condition discussed previously).
