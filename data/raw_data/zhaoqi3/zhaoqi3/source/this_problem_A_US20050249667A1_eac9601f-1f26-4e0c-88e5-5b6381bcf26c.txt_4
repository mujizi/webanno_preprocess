[0512] U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,015 also discloses that: "It remains desirable to minimize the time spent in uplink telemetry and downlink transmissions both to reduce the likelihood that the telemetry link may be broken and to reduce current consumption."
[0513] "Moreover, it is desirable to eliminate the need to hold the programmer RF telemetry antenna still and in proximity with the implantable medical device RF telemetry antenna for the duration of the telemetry transmission. As will become apparent from the following, the present invention satisfies these needs."
[0514] The solution to this problem is presented, e.g., in claim 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,861,019. This claim describes "A telemetry system for communications between an external programmer and an implantable medical device, comprising: the external programmer comprising an external telemetry antenna and an external transceiver for receiving uplink telemetry transmissions and transmitting downlink telemetry transmission through the external telemetry antenna; the implantable medical device comprising an implantable medical device housing, an implantable telemetry antenna and an implantable transceiver for receiving downlink transmissions and for transmitting uplink telemetry transmission through the implantable telemetry antenna, the implantable medical device housing being formed of a conductive metal and having an exterior housing surface and an interior housing surface; the implantable medical device housing being formed with a housing recess extending inwardly from the exterior housing surface to a predetermined housing recess depth in the predetermined substrate area of the exterior housing surface for receiving the dielectric substrate therein; wherein the implantable telemetry antenna is a conformal microstrip antenna formed as part of the implantable medical device housing, the microstrip antenna having electrically conductive ground plane and radiator patch layers separated by a dielectric substrate, layer the conductive radiator patch layer having a predetermined thickness and predetermined radiator patch layer dimensions, the patch layer being formed upon one side of the dielectric substrate layer."
[0515] U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,762, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification, discloses an external transmitter adapted to magnetically excite an implanted receiver coil; such an implanted receiver coil may be disposed near, e.g., the anti-mitotic compound of this invention and/or other devices and/or tubulin and/or microtubules. Claim 1 of this patent describes "An external transmitter adapted for magnetically exciting an implanted receiver coil, causing an electrical current to flow in the implanted receiver coil, comprising: (a) a support; (b) a magnetic field generator that is mounted to the support; and (c) a prime mover that is drivingly coupled to an element of the magnetic field generator to cause said element of the magnetic field generator to reciprocate, in a reciprocal motion, said reciprocal motion of said element of the magnetic field generator producing a varying magnetic field that is adapted to induce an electrical current to flow in the implanted receiver coil."
[0516] U.S. Pat. No. 5,954,758, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification, claims an implantable electrical stimulator comprised of an implantable radio frequency receiving coil, an implantable power supply, an implantable input signal generator, an implantable decoder, and an implantable electrical stimulator. Claim 1 of this patent describes "A system for transcutaneously telemetering position signals out of a human body and for controlling a functional electrical stimulator implanted in said human body, said system comprising: an implantable radio frequency receiving coil for receiving a transcutaneous radio frequency signal; an implantable power supply connected to said radio frequency receiving coil, said power supply converting received transcutaneous radio frequency signals into electromotive power; an implantable input signal generator electrically powered by said implantable power supply for generating at least one analog input movement signal to indicate voluntary bodily movement along an axis; an implantable encoder having an input operatively connected with said implantable input signal generator for encoding said movement signal into output data in a preselected data format; an impedance altering means connected with said encoder and said implantable radio frequency signal receiving coil to selectively change an impedance of said implantable radio frequency signal receiving coil; an external radio frequency signal transmit coil inductively coupled with said implantable radio frequency signal receiving coil, such that impedance changes in said implantable radio frequency signal receiving coil are sensed by said external radio frequency signal transmit coil to establish a sensed modulated movement signal in said external transmit coil; an external control system electrically connected to said external radio frequency transmit coil for monitoring said sensed modulated movement signal in said external radio frequency transmit coil, said external control system including: a demodulator for recovering the output data of said encoder from the sensed modulated ovement signal of said external transmit coil, a pulse width algorithm means for applying a preselected pulse width algorithm to the recovered output data to derive a first pulse width, an amplitude algorithm means for applying an amplitude algorithm to the recovered output data to derive a first amplitude therefrom, an interpulse interval algorithm means for applying an interpulse algorithm to the recovered output data to derive a first interpulse interval therefrom; and, a stimulation pulse train signal generator for generating a stimulus pulse train signal which has the first pulse width and the first pulse amplitude; an implantable functional electrical stimulator for receiving said stimulation pulse train signal from said stimulation pulse train signal generator and generating stimulation pulses with the first pulse width, the first pulse amplitude, and separated by the first interpulse interval; and, at least one electrode operatively connected with the functional electrical stimulator for applying said stimulation pulses to muscle tissue of said human body."
