[0083] The rolling motion has a good washing ability and a low vibration level, with minimized laundry damage and low motor load. As a result, the rolling motion may be used in all of the washing courses, especially, to aid detergent dissolution in an initial washing stage and to wet the laundry.
[0084] The tumbling motion has a lower washing ability than the scrub motion and a middle vibration level in comparison to the scrub motion and the rolling motion. The rolling motion has a lower vibration level but it has a longer washing time than the tumbling motion. Because of that, the tumbling motion may be applicable to all of the washing courses and may be effective in a washing course to distribute the laundry uniformly.
[0085] The squeeze motion has a similar washing ability to the tumbling motion and a higher vibration level than the tumbling motion. The squeeze motion repeats the process of drawing the laundry toward and separating the laundry from the inner circumferential surface of the drum. In this process, the wash water is discharged outside of the drum after passing through the laundry. Thus, the squeeze motion may be applied to rinsing.
[0086] The filtration motion has a lower washing ability than the squeeze motion and a similar noise level to the rolling motion. In the filtration motion, the water passes through the laundry and is discharged out of the drum, with the laundry in close contact with the inner circumferential surface of the drum. As a result, the filtration motion may be applied to a course for wetting of the laundry.
[0087] The swing motion has the lowest vibration level and washing ability and may be applied in a low noise and low vibration washing course and a course for washing sensitive or delicate articles.
