[0002] In this context "horizontal connecting device" has that meaning that the connecting parts are mated in a substantially horizontal direction.
[0003] On subsea structures, for example manifold and valve structures, which are deployed on the seabed, piping is often arranged thereon having one or more pipes that terminate in open pipe subs, or porches, forming a connecting point. Each connecting point includes a stationary connecting part. "Stationary" in this context means relative to the subsea structure. The connecting point is later used for connection to an external pipe.
[0004] There exist two principles for the connecting devices, either vertical or horizontal. For a horizontal connecting device the connecting point projects horizontally out from the structure. In the North Sea this solution almost has market control. Other places, like the Gulf of Mexico for example, the vertical solution is the most common one.
[0005] One example of a vertical connecting device is shown in NO 2009 2880.
[0006] It is to be mentioned that in principle there are three (or actually two) different forms for external connections to a structure: [0007] Direct connection between two structures. Here, a rigid pipe having a mobile connecting part at each end normally will be used. This will usually be termed a jumper. The jumper will be manufactured based on measuring the relative position of the two connecting points. [0008] Connection between the end of a pipeline (rigid pipe) and a structure. It is almost impossible (at least very difficult) to connect a rigid pipe line directly to a structure preinstalled on the seabed. Thus, an intermediate piece of pipe, frequently termed a "spool", is provided between the pipe line and the structure. In order to be able to connect the spool to the pipeline, the pipeline will be welded directly to a small structure including a connecting point. A spool is in principle like the jumper described above. [0009] Direct connection of a flexible pipeline or umbilical to a structure. In some cases it is chosen to use so called flexible pipes in stead of rigid steel pipes. Such pipes can be compared with a big garden hose. Then it is not necessary with a spool or jumper between the end of the pipe and the structure. The pipe is so flexible that one may have a mobile connector part right on the end of the pipe, and connect this one directly to the stationary connector part on the structure. Then it is neither necessary to make precise measurements of the position on the connecting point on the structure.
