The catalyst composition, given in Table 1 under Example No. 2, was made as follows in the geometrical shape III in FIG. 1:
EXAMPLE 2
The coprecipitate for making the active catalyst phase is produced by dissolving 484.8 g Fe(NO.sub.3).sub.3.9H.sub.2 O, 291.0 g Co(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O, 1163.2 g Ni(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O and 2.5 g KNO.sub.3 in 3.1 liters of water; and, while stirring, at 90.degree. C., one first of all adds a solution of 17.4 g Sm.sub.2 O.sub.3 in 106 g of concentrated HNO.sub.3. While stirring further, one adds to this solution 601 g highly-dispersed silicic acid (Aerosil 200) and 1202 g of tempered montmorillonite (specific surface according to BET <1 m.sup.2 /g). In a separate vessel, at 60.degree. C., one prepares a solution of 2118.6 g (NH.sub.4).sub.6 Mo.sub.7 O.sub.24.6H.sub.2 O in 2.7 liters H.sub.2 O; and to it we add 92.2 g of 85% H.sub.3 PO.sub.4 while stirring intensively.
After that, the two solutions are combined amid intensive stirring and one adds a solution of 242.5 g Bi(NO.sub.3).sub.3.5H.sub.2 O in 204 g of 8.2% HNO.sub.3. The suspension thus obtained is dried in a sprayed drier at a drying air entry temperature of 550.degree. C. The ratio between drying air volume and sprayed suspension quantity is adjusted here so that one gets an exit temperature of 170.degree. C. and the suspension quantity is adjusted so that one gets the duration of 6 seconds spent by the spray dried powder in the spray drier. The atomization intensity is selected so that one gets a spray dried powder with an average diameter of dp=25 .mu.m. The spray dried powder is calcined for 30 minutes in a rotary cylindrical kiln at a maximum temperature of the spray dried powder of 420.degree. C.
1.6 kg of the calcined spray dried powder is arranged in a kneader/extruder combination and is mixed with 0.4 kg pentaerythritol, having an average particle diameter of dp=40 .mu.m ("very finely ground"), for a period of 5 minutes. To this mixture one adds 493 g of a 6 weight % tylose solution in which 26.6 g petroleum had first been emulsified. This mass is now kneaded until a homogeneous plastic state has been attained. Extrusion then takes place at a pressure of 10 bar and a temperature of 30.degree. C. in the extruded mass. The extruded hollow strand is cut off after every 5 mm, the rings that are cut off (having a diameter of 5 mm, a length of 5 mm and an inside diameter of 1.8 mm) are carefully dried at 80.degree. C.
