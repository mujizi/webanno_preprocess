[0042] The method 200 can be described in yet another way where the mobile terminal 102 and in particular the receiver 108 receives (see box labeled "1" in FIG. 1) a pilot signal p.sub.i(t) from one of the transmit antennas 106-1, 106-2 . . . 106-M located within in the base station 104. Then the mobile terminal 102 computes (step 206) a channel estimate c(n) of a real part of a complex coefficient of a channel tap for a channel corresponding to a transmitted pilot signal. The mobile terminal 102 also generates a reconstructed channel estimate e(n) of the real part of the complex coefficient of the channel tap associated with the channel corresponding to the pilot signal using feedback bits that were sent in the past to the base station 104. The mobile terminal 102 determines (step 212) a difference between the channel estimate c(n) and the reconstructed channel estimate e(n) and quantizes (step 212) that difference into two levels so as to generate (step 212) a +1 feedback bit b(n) if the difference is a positive number or generate a -1 feedback bit b(n) if the difference is a negative number. The mobile terminal 102 sends the feedback bit b(n) (see box labeled "2" in FIG. 1) over the feedback channel 110 to the base station 104. In addition, the mobile terminal 102 performs these computing, generating, determining and quantizing steps to generate a feedback bit b(n) for an imaginary part of the complex coefficient of the channel tap associated with the channel corresponding to the pilot signal. This feedback bit b(n) is also sent to the base station 104 (see box labeled "2" in FIG. 1). Feedback bits corresponding to some or all of the channel taps are sent in this manner. The base station then analyzes (steps 226 and 228) these feedback bits b(n) to optimize the subsequent transmission of data (see box labeled "3" in FIG. 1) to the mobile terminal 102. It should be noted that the mobile terminal 102 can compensate for a feedback delay by estimating (step 210) a channel estimate c(n+d) for d time steps ahead and using the c(n+d) instead of c(n) in the aforementioned determining and quantizing step (step 212). It should also be noted that the mobile terminal 102 can adapt (step 208) the step size i(n) for a current time step based on previous feedback bits where the adapt step size i(n) indicates a weight to be accorded to the current feedback bit b(n) when reconstructing the channel estimate e(n)(step 214).
[0043] It should be further noted that the method 200 described above is only one embodiment of the present invention. Other embodiments of the present invention include moving the prediction step 210 that is shown performed by the mobile terminal 102 to the base station 104. In this case, the base station 104 performs the prediction step based on its reconstructed waveform of the channel e.sub.b(m). Other embodiments include combining the predictions characterized by the functions f(c) and h(e) into one step. In this case, the formulation of the delta-modulation method 200 at the mobile terminal 102 then involves skipping step 210 and modifying steps 212 and 214 as follows: b(n)=sgn(c(n)-h'(e')) (6) e(n)=h'(e')+i(n)b(n) (7) where e'=[e(n-d), . . . ,e(1)] and e(n) is computed at the base station 104.
[0044] Additional embodiments of method 200 are described in detail below: [0045] Initial synchronization: FIG. 3 is a graph which shows that the base station 104 can take a few slots at the start of the communication session to lock on to the channel with the mobile terminal 102. For data communication systems with very short session times, this may be undesirable. In order to circumvent this, a more complete channel estimate such as the traditional TDRF (8 bits per tap) scheme that needs more feedback bits can be sent initially at session establishment. And then subsequently, the method 200 can be implemented and 2 delta-modulated bits per tap can be sent from the mobile terminal 102 to update the channel estimate at the base station 104. [0046] Resynchronization: When bit transmission errors or frame losses occur on the feedback channel 110, the mobile terminal 102 and the base station 104 can lose synchronization. This can be detected at the base station 104 by checking for inordinately long runs of +1 or -1 received delta-modulated feedback bits b(n). When this happens, the base station 104 can prompt the mobile terminal 102 to perform the initial synchronization technique again and then after this restart the delta-modulation method 200. Alternatively, frame errors at the mobile terminal 102, indicated by error detection codes, can be used to alert the mobile terminal 102 that the base station 104 is using wrong reconstructed channel estimates for pre-filtering its transmissions to the mobile terminal 102. The mobile terminal 102 can then send more detailed channel information, as in the initial synchronization procedure, to resynchronize proceedings with the base station 104. [0047] Periodic full channel feedback: Periodically, more complete information about the channel along with a time-stamp and with delay information if needed can be sent from the mobile terminal 102 to the base station 104. This is different than the previous resynchronization embodiment since the base station 104 in this embodiment does not prompt or initiate this process, nor is it initiated by the mobile terminal 102 based on any detection of frame errors. It should be appreciated that the mobile terminal 102 can send the more complete channel information in this embodiment or the previous two embodiments using control or acknowledgement messages at the higher layers.
[0048] From the foregoing, it can be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present invention provides a receiver unit (e.g., mobile terminal) capable of performing the following steps: (1) receiving a pilot signal from a transmit antenna located within in a transmitter unit; (2) analyzing a channel tap associated with the transmit antenna and exploiting the temporal correlations of the channel tap to generate the following (i) a delta-modulated feedback bit indicative of a real part of a complex coefficient of the channel tap associated with the pilot signal and (ii) a delta-modulated feedback bit indicative of an imaginary part of the complex coefficient of the channel tap associated with the pilot signal; and (3) sending the two feedback bits over a feedback channel to the transmitter unit which analyzes the two feedback bits and other similarly transmitted feedback bits, corresponding to other channel taps of the same transmit antenna and other transmit antennas, to optimize the subsequent transmission of data to the receiver unit.
[0049] Following are some additional features, advantages and uses of the present invention:[0050] The method 200 enables a receiver unit (e.g., mobile terminal, base station) to send detailed information back to a transmitter unit (e.g., base station, mobile terminal) while sending a very low quantity of information in each time unit, i.e., utilizing low feed back bandwidth. This is done by exploiting the temporal correlation of the channel. [0051] The method 200 improves the performance of the wireless communications system 100 for a given reverse link bandwidth by making the encoding of channel feedback information more efficient. [0052] Although the preferred method 200 was described above in the context of a wireless communication system 100 that had transmit antenna diversity at the base station 104, it should be understood that the preferred method 200 could be used to feedback detailed channel information between any two nodes in any communication system. [0053] As described above, the traditional solutions consume higher bandwidth on the feedback channel to achieve the same level of performance as compared to the solution presented in method 200. In particular, for a three-tap channel, quantizing the real and imaginary parts to 16 levels requires, sending {log.sub.2(16)].times.2.times.3=24 bits per time unit. The solution described in method 200 requires feeding back only 6 bits per time unit with no loss, and perhaps a gain in performance. The reason for the higher bandwidth requirement with traditional solutions is that they don't exploit the temporal correlation of the channel taps, i.e., the fact that the channel values from one time unit to the next are not completely independent, as is done in method 200. [0054] Even though the wireless communications network is described herein as being a third generation cellular system, it should be appreciated that the wireless communications network could implement other standards besides the third generation standard.
