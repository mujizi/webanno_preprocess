[0245] As is also disclosed in International Publication WO 02/36603, "Also the expression pattern is very similar between the various species as can be taken from the following table [Sullivan K. F., 1988, Arm. Rev. Cell Biol. 4: 687-716] which comprises the respective human members of each class . . . The C terminal end of the beta-tubulins starting from amino acid 430 is regarded as highly variable between the various classes. Additionally, the members of the same class seem to be very conserved between the various species."
[0246] As is also disclosed in International Publication WO 02/36603, "As tubulin molecules are involved in many processes and form part of many structures in the eucaryotic cell, they are possible targets for pharmaceutically active compounds. As tubulin is more particularly the main structural component of the microtubules it may act as point of attack for anticancer drugs such as vinblastin, colchicin, estramustin and taxol which interfere with microtubule function. The mode of action is such that cytostatic agents such as the ones mentioned above, bind to the carboxyterminal end the beta-tubulin which upon such binding undergoes a conformational change. For example, Kavallaris et al. [Kavallaris et al. 1997, J. Clin. Invest. 100: 1282-1293] reported a change in the expression of of specific beta-tubulin isotypes (class I, II, III, and IVa) in taxol resistant epithelial ovarian tumor. It was concluded that these tubulins are involved in the formation of the taxol resistence. Also a high expression of class III beta--tubulins was found in some forms of lung cancer suggesting that this isotype may be used as a diagnostic marker."
[0247] As is also disclosed in International Publication WO 02/36603, "The problem underlying the present invention was to provide the means to further characterize the various tubulins present in eucaryotic cells. A further problem underlying the present invention was to provide the means to extend possible screening programs for cytostatic agents to other isotypes of human beta-tubulins. This problem is solved in a first aspect by a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a tubulin molecule, wherein said nucleic acid molecule comprises the sequence according to SEQ. ID. No. I This problem is `solved in a second aspect by a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a tubulin molecule, wherein said nucleic acid molecule comprises the sequence according to SEQ.1D. No. 2 . . . "
[0248] Published U.S. patent application 2002/0106705, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification, describes a method for detecting a modified beta-tubulin isotype. Claim 1 of this patent, which is typical, describes: "A method of detecting in a sample a .beta.-tubulin isotype modified at cysteine residue 239, the method comprising the steps of: (a) providing a sample treated with a .beta.-tubulin modifying agent; (b) contacting the sample with an antibody that specifically binds to a .beta.-tubulin isotype modified at cysteine residue 239; and (c) determining whether the sample contains a modified .beta.-tubulin isotype by detecting the antibody." This patent discloses that: "Microtubules are composed of .alpha./.beta.-tubulin heterodimers and constitute a crucial component of the cell cytoskeleton. Furthermore, microtubules play a pivotal role during cell division, in particular when the replicated chromosomes are separated during mitosis. Interference with the ability to form microtubules from .alpha./.beta.-tubulin heterodimeric subunits generally leads to cell cycle arrest. This event can, in certain cases, induce programmed cell death. Thus, natural products and organic compounds that interfere with microtubule formation have been used successfully as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various human cancers."
[0249] Published United States paent application 2002/0106705 also discloses that: "Pentafluorophenylsulfonamidobenzenes and related sulfhydryl and disulfide modifying agents (see, e.g., compound 1; 2-fluoro-1-methoxy-4-pentafluorophenylsulfonamidobenzene . . . prevent microtubule formation by selectively covalently modifying .beta.-tubulin. For example, compound 1 does not covalently modify all of the five known .beta.-tubulin isotypes. Instead, binding is restricted to those .beta.-tubulin isotypes that have a cysteine residue at amino acid position 239 in .beta.-tubulin. Such isotypes include .beta.1, .beta.2 and .beta.4-tubulin. The other two isotypes (.beta.3 and .beta.5) have a serine residue at this particular position (Shan et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci USA 96:5686-5691 (1999)). It is notable that no other cellular proteins are modified by compound 1."
