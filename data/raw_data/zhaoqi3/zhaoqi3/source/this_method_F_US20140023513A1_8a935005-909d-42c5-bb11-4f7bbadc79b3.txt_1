[0052] For example, FIG. 4B is converted from FIG. 4A by using this method. The percentage of effective area of agglomerated particles to the fiber bundle can be calculated by using image analysis software such as Adobe Photoshop, MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox, or Image-Pro to count the number of pixels in the agglomerated particle area divided by total number of pixels in the image. The percentage of effective area of agglomerated particles to the fibers can be calculated by using image analysis software such as Adobe Photoshop, MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox, or Image-Pro to count the number of pixels in the agglomerated particle area divided by total number of pixels in the fiber region. Based on this method, the effective area of agglomerated particles to the whole fiber bundle is 15.7%. The effective area of agglomerated particles to the fibers is 24.2%.
[0053] Typically, measurements of the bundle of fibers are taken after infusion because cutting a bundle of fibers may produce a large amount of debris which can make identifying the bridges difficult. Moreover, during SEM, the fibers and bridges may develop an electrostatic potential, possibly causing them to move and making imaging significantly more difficult. Finally, it is difficult to obtain a straight and perpendicular cut through the fiber bundle in order to have a flat cross section to measure. It believed that the cloud structure in the agglomerated particle cloud network coated fiber bundle is substantially the same as the cloud structure in the agglomerated particle cloud network composite. The reasons behind this belief include 1) the flow velocity of resin in the fiber bundles is driven by capillary forces and hence is low, so there is little chance of bridges getting washed away or moved, 2) bridges are adhered to the surface of the fibers (i.e. typically cannot be washed off), 3) bridges form to the contour of the fibers, thus, if the fibers twist in the bundle and the space between fibers changes shape the solid agglomerates will not be able to push through the tortuous path (they could possibly slide down the center of an ordered array of fibers) so they have limited mobility within the bundle 4) the size of the bridges is large relative to the separation distance between fibers, so they will have trouble getting out of a fiber bundle, 5) experiments showed that the shape of agglomerated particles doesn't change after it is immersed in resin in the time scale of resin curing time. This suggests that the agglomerated particles are not able to be dissolved or re-dispersed in resin.
[0054] Agglomerated particle cloud network coated fiber bundles may be measured before infusion if they are held in place, for instance by pulling out a single tow from a fabric then wrapping it in heat shrink tubing and shrinking the tubing before cleaving it to image a cross section. FIG. 5 shows an SEM image taken by this method. One can see the bridging structure between adjacent fibers before resin infusion. While this provides a better image, it does not yield a flat surface that can be used for quantification.
[0055] While the agglomerated particle cloud network 200 may cover between about 3 and 100% of the surface area of the fibers 110, the agglomerated nanoparticles are discontinuous on the surface. This means that while the fibers may have a thin coating of non-agglomerated nanoparticles, binders, and other coating additives, the agglomerated nanoparticles do not cover the surface of the fibers completely. In one embodiment, the agglomerated nanoparticles cover between about 3% and 99% of the circumferential area of the fibers and between about 3% and 99% along a line down the longitudinal direction of the fibers.
[0056] The bundle of fibers 100 may be any suitable bundle of fibers for the end product. The composite may contain a single bundle of fibers or the bundle of fibers may be in a textile layer including but not limited to a woven textile, non-woven textile (such as a chopped strand mat), bonded textile, knit textile, a unidirectional textile, and a sheet of strands. In one embodiment, the bundle of fibers 100 are formed into unidirectional strands such as rovings and may be held together by bonding, knitting a securing yarn across the rovings, or weaving a securing yarn across the rovings. In the case of woven, knit, warp knit/weft insertion, non-woven, or bonded the textile can have fibers that are disposed in a multi- (bi- or tri- or quadri-) axial direction. In one embodiment, the bundle of fibers contains an average of at least about 2 fibers, more preferably at least about 20 fibers. The fibers 110 within the bundles of fibers 100 generally are aligned and parallel, meaning that the axes along the lengths of the fibers 110 are generally aligned and parallel.
