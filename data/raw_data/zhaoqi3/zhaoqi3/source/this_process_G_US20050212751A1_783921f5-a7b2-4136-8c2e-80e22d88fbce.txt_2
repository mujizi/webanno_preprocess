[0068] Particular embodiments of the present invention include the ability to allow a user to repeatedly selectively engage and disengage the motion sensitivity of the handheld device in order to allow greater movement through a virtual desktop (or information space) using motion input in a limited amount of physical space. This process can be analogized to "scrubbing" with a mouse controlling a cursor, or lifting the mouse off of a surface and replacing the mouse on the surface at a different location to allow greater movement of the cursor. Lifting the mouse breaks the connection between the motion of the mouse and the motion of the cursor. Similarly, a user may be able to engage and disengage the connection between the motion of a handheld device, such as device 10, and the operations, functions or actions based on movement of the device.
[0069] FIG. 8 illustrates an example of the use of scrubbing functionality to navigate across a virtual desktop, or information space, larger than the display of a handheld device. In the illustrated example, a handheld device is used to navigate through virtual desktop 90. Virtual desktop 90 is illustrated as a grid map and may represent any suitable information through which a user may desire to navigate. Information of virtual desktop displayed at the handheld device is represented by box 92. In this embodiment, translation of the handheld device is used to navigate through virtual desktop 90. For example, a user may move the handheld device from right to left to navigate from right to left through information of virtual desktop 90. It should be understood that while the example illustrated describes moving the device to the right to implement the scrubbing process, it should be understood that handheld devices of particular embodiments may be moved in any suitable manner to implement the scrubbing process.
[0070] As indicated above, box 92 represents the information of virtual desktop 90 currently displayed at the device. If a user desired to view information represented at box 94, the user may move the handheld device from left to right. For purposes of this example, imagine that the user moves the device to the right, and the information of virtual desktop 90 contained in box 94 is displayed at the device. Also imagine that the user's arm is now outstretched to the user's right such that the user must walk or otherwise move further right in order to view at the display of the device information of virtual desktop 90 that is to the right of box 94. If this were the case, and the user could not, or did not desire to, walk or otherwise move further to the right so that the device would be moved further to the right, then the user could selectively disengage the motion sensitivity of the handheld device, move the device back to the left, selectively reengage the motion sensitivity of the device and move the device back to the right to display information to the right of box 94. In this manner, the user could display information of virtual desktop 90 contained in box 96, and this process could be repeated to display information contained in box 98, which is further to the right of box 96.
[0071] The selective disengagement and reengagement of the motion sensitivity of the device in order to allow greater movement within a virtual desktop in a limited amount of physical space may be enabled in any of a variety of ways, such as by a key on an input of the device, moving the device according to a particular gesture or movement (e.g., an arc movement) or tapping the device display. Any other user-initiated action may be used to disengage and reengage motion sensitivity for this purpose. Particular embodiments may allow multiple actions to disengage and reengage motion sensitivity of the device. Moreover, a user action that disengages motion sensitivity of the device may be different from a user action that reengages motion sensitivity. This scrubbing process may be performed in any suitable application, such as map navigation, menu navigation and scrolling through a list.
[0072] FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating the steps of the scrubbing process described above with respect to FIG. 8, in accordance with a particular embodiment. The flowchart begins at step 100, where the handheld device is moved to the right to go from displaying information of box 92 of virtual display 90 to information of box 94. As indicated above, the user may desire to display information further to the right of box 94 but may have run out of physical space to move the device further to the right. Thus, the user disengages the motion sensitivity of the device at step 102. Any suitable user action may perform such disengagement, such as the pressing of a button on the device or moving the device according to a particular gesture. At step 104, the user moves the device to the left so that the user will have more physical space through which the user may move the device to the right when motion sensitivity is reengaged.
