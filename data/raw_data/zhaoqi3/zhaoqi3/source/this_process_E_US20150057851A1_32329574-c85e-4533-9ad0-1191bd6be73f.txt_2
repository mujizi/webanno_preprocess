[0084] One particular type of item frequently encountered in the railroad right of way is a grade crossing. The LIDAR image 1200 in FIG. 12 shows a section of railroad track 1202 with a grade crossing 1204 across a road 1206. Using this type of image, a variety of characteristics can be measured or calculated. For example, the length and width of the crossing 1204 can be measured, and the vertical angle of approach of the road 1206 can be measured (i.e. the grade change or angle at the point where the road surface meets the tracks). This type of image can also be used for highways as well as railways, and can be used to measure overhead clearances, slope or profile or roadways and shoulders, detect condition of pavement, etc. This information can be used for a variety of maintenance and analysis purposes.
[0085] Another use for the LIDAR image 1200 is to determine whether objects protrude into a prescribed safety envelope around the track. For example, the image 1200 shows objects near the right of way such as a railing 1208, trees 1210, utility poles 1212, etc. Other objects that are likely to be in or near the right of way can include fences, buildings, railroad signals and appurtenances, etc. The LIDAR image 1200 allows the system to optically determine the location of such items, and calculate whether they intrude into the safety envelope around the track. This can allow automatic identification of track locations where maintenance or other work may be needed to bring the right of way up to desired standards for geometry and safety.
[0086] As discussed above the physical components of the ballast profiling system can be attached to a rail vehicle, such as hi-rail truck 200, shown in FIGS. 2A-2B. Another embodiment of hi-rail vehicle 1300 that can be used in this process is shown in FIGS. 13 and 14. This vehicle 1300 is similar to the vehicle 200 shown in FIGS. 2A-2B and FIG. 3, and can generally include all of the features and capabilities described with respect to that vehicle, such as a wheel encoder, GPS and gyro devices, cameras, etc. The LIDAR devices 1310, 1312 of this vehicle are oriented downward toward the track 1304, and one or more cameras (not shown) can be oriented to take a video image of the track and surrounding area. The LIDAR devices 1310, 1312 are positioned above each rail 1314 of the railroad track, and are oriented downward toward the track 1304, so as to obtain an image of the rails 1314 and other nearby structure, and provide pulses of light that sweep in an arc, pictorially represented at 1306, across the tracks to give reflection data, which is received and processed in the manner discussed above.
[0087] The sweep or field of view 1306 of each LIDAR emitters 1310, 1312 can be about 270 degrees, as with the embodiment shown and described above with respect to FIGS. 2A-2B and FIG. 3. Advantageously, however, the orientation of the field of view of each LIDAR device can be rotated outward, away from the center of the rails, as shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, so that both LIDAR devices still scan both rails 1314 and also the ties 1316, but also scan a greater region above and to the sides of the track 1304 and the vehicle 1300. This broader sweep configuration can be useful to show structures near the track, and also for dimensioning bridges or tunnels, for example, yet without having 360 degree LIDAR emitters. As another alternative, the LIDAR devices can be rotated cross-track. For example, the LIDAR devices can be rotated to cross at some specific angle (e.g. 45.degree.) relative to the track. Other LIDAR devices, such as those with a 360 degree field of view can also be used.
[0088] For a ballast scanning system to accurately estimate an amount of ballast that is needed, it is desirable that the system be able to register the geometry of the ideal ballast profile to the scene representing the actual ballast profile. It is desirable that the ideal profile is matched to the tops of the ties with a relatively tight tolerance in order to be representative of all ties. Because this desired tolerance is relatively tight, it is desirable to only consider tie tops, and not the ballast between the ties, which could distort the measurement. This condition suggests that calibration of the geometric features of the ballast scanning vehicle and its scanning system relative to the ties and/or other track features is desirable.
