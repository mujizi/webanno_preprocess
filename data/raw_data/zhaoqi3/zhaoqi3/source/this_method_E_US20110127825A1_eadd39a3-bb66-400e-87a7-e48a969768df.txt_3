[0248] FIG. 14a-c illustrate in a plan view the development of a solution mining system 5 which comprises a virgin section of a trona bed 505 with a dip gradient and two directional boreholes 510 and 535. The virgin section of a trona bed will go through various development phases described hereinafter during its life cycle. Since the length of a cycle can be considerable such as several years, it is recommended to have a plurality of bed sections in various phases of development.
[0249] Referring to FIG. 14a, during the drilling phase, two directional boreholes with single casings are drilled, one (510) at an up-dip location `A` and the other one (535) at a down-dip location `B`, at first vertically and then in a more horizontal fashion, at an angle .alpha. for borehole 510 and an angle .beta. for borehole 535 with respect to the direction of dip gradient. The angle .alpha. is generally between 10 and 85 degrees, and the angle .beta. is generally between 95 and 170 degrees. The two boreholes 510 and 535 connect at a point C generally although not necessarily positioned about mid-dip and laterally-spaced from points A and B so that points A, B, C define a triangular shape with an area of from about 0.5 to 5 square kilometers. A sump is created at the bottom of the vertical portion of the down-dip borehole 535 at location B, and a sump pump is installed in the sump. The casing 516 in the somewhat horizontal portion of the up-dip borehole 510 is pulled at a predetermined distance which is least 5 feet, or least 10 feet, or at least 20 feet from the connection point `C` to create an unlined borehole portion 515. The casing of the down-dip borehole 535 is removed all the way to the sump (at point `B`). The vertical portions of boreholes 510 and 535 are preferably lined with casings so as to prevent their erosion during undercut formation and production phases.
[0250] Solvent 52 (e.g., water or an unsaturated solution comprising sodium carbonate, bicarbonate and/or hydroxide) is injected at a temperature between ambient temperature and 220.degree. F. (104.degree. C.) in the up-dip borehole 510 for it to flow into unlined borehole portion 515 and to expose fresh trona ore and dissolve some trona, thus forming a voided area called undercut 560. As the solvent impregnated by dissolved trona flows towards the sump, it forms a liquor 55, which is collected in the sump of the down-dip borehole 535. The sump pump removes this liquor to the surface. This undercut formation phase is not performed under static head pressure. The dissolution first proceeds along the edge of the connection (point `C`) and its spreading is dictated by saturation and gravity. The flow rate and temperature of the solvent 52 should be controlled so as to ensure saturation of the pregnant solution as it reaches the sump. If unsaturated solution reaches the sump, this may create unwanted dissolution patterns and probable short-circuiting pathways and lower overall recovery rates. The undercut formation is considered complete once the casing 516 of the up-dip borehole 510 is pulled all the way up to the beginning of the vertical portion of the borehole 510, so as to maximize the undercut area. For the production phase, a vertical collection well 570 may be drilled at the lowest down-dip part of the bed (e.g., point `D` in FIG. 14c) and in fluid communication with the undercut cavity 560, and a second sump pump is installed at the bottom of this well. The undercut cavity 560 is filled with solution (preferably a solution circulated from other series of boreholes with undercut still in formation) which is injected through the up-dip borehole 510. The solution is collected through the collection well 570 and then pumped to the surface via the second sump pump as a solution saturated in sodium values (carbonate and/or bicarbonate). This production phase is not performed under static head pressure, but rather is performed below static head pressure. The dissolution of trona occurs both in the horizontal and vertical directions. The production phase continue until the exiting solution no longer is saturated in sodium carbonate/bicarbonate, which is indicative that the trona is almost exhausted from this undercut 560. It is expected that the extraction rate would be around 80-90% by using this method.
[0251] FIG. 15a illustrates in a plan view a solution mining system 6 which comprises a virgin section of a trona bed 605 with or without a dip gradient, a directional borehole 610, and a vertical borehole 635. In its initial development, the vertical borehole 635 is drilled through the trona bed and terminates underneath the floor of the trona bed 605 to a sump 628 where a sump pump 630 with a discharge pipe to the surface is installed. Borehole 635 comprises a steel casing with a fiberglass section 640 positioned through the trona bed 605. The borehole 610 is first drilled vertically and provided with a steel casing until it approaches the roof of the bed 605 at which point borehole 610 is then directionally drilled to curve well into the bed 605 to intersect a portion of the fiberglass casing of the borehole 635. The drilling is continued above and near the floor of the bed 605 to create a generally horizontal unlined portion 615 with a downhole end 619.
[0252] A conduit 40 is then inserted into the borehole 610 so that its downhole extremity 50 approaches the downhole end 619 of unlined borehole portion 615. The downhole conduit extremity 50, which serves as or contains the solvent injection zone, is positioned at a predetermined distance from the downhole borehole end 619, and is designed to inject the solvent to the ore region in the vicinity of the downhole conduit extremity 50, generally to at least a section of the ore-containing walls of the unlined borehole portion 615. The predetermined distance between the downhole conduit extremity 50 and the downhole end 619 of unlined borehole portion 615 may be at least 10 feet, or at least 25 feet, or at least 50 feet. The predetermined distance may be at most 750 feet, or at most 500 feet, or at most 400 feet.
