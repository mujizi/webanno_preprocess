[0014] After drilling a first lateral through the lowermost hole of the lowermost casing section, the indexing tool is cycled to position the diverter device precisely adjacent to the next higher hole in the lowermost casing section to allow for the drilling of the next lateral wellbore. In a similar manner, all laterals to be drilled or jetted from the parent well through the succession of pre-machined holes in the lowermost casing section are constructed.
[0015] After constructing all of the laterals from the lowermost casing section, the diverter assembly is detached from the orienting device of the lowermost casing section and moved to the next higher casing section where the lateral construction process is repeated in a similar fashion.
[0016] Upon completion of the lateral wellbore construction process, the geometry of the machined hole openings in the casing sections will allow for sequential fracture stimulation treatments using degradable, spherically-shaped ball sealers which are sized slightly larger than the diameter of the hole openings in the casing sections. In this sequential fracture stimulation process, the ball sealers are released to the stimulation fluids from a location above the targeted lateral wellbores (i.e., from the surface) in stages to intentionally divert stimulation fluids which are being predominately injected into a particular lateral into one or more additional laterals. For example, if eight laterals extending from a parent well are to be stimulated using this process, approximately seven ball sealers would be used to divide each of eight fracture stimulation stages. This sequential fracture stimulation process is intended to ensure each lateral is effectively stimulated and to promote the alteration of the effective in-situ stress state in the targeted zones in near real-time, thus promoting the creation of highly productive complex induced fracture systems.
[0017] In addition, multiple closely spaced parent wells each having a multitude of lateral wellbore completions in a certain targeted reservoir may be simultaneously fracture stimulated which will further alter the effective in-situ stress state in the targeted zones in near real-time, thus promoting the creation of even more productive complex induced fracture systems.
[0018] It is also contemplated that specific zones and/or clusters of multi-lateral wellbores may be initially fracture stimulated, produced for a period of time, and then re-fracture stimulated in order to further promote the creation of very complex fracture systems by taking advantage of the changed effective in-situ stress state in the targeted reservoirs. With this method, not all induced fractures will be created parallel to the present-day in-situ maximum horizontal stress direction, thus allowing the well completion to have more exposure to the reservoir. Additionally, application of this method will reduce the chance of fracturing out-of-zone in situations where there is not a significant difference in stress and/or rock strength properties between the targeted reservoir and the adjacent formations because the injection rates into each well will be significantly less than the rate which would be required to create the same degree of induced fracture networks if a single well with a single lateral was treated using conventional completion practices.
