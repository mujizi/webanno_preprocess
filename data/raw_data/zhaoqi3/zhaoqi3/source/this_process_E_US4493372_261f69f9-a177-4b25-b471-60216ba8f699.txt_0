In order to improve the bond between the outer surface of the casing and the surrounding cement sheath, a commonly used procedure is to form a scabrous surface on the exterior of the casing string prior to the cement operation. Thus, U.S. Pat. No. 3,255,819 to Scott et al discloses that a scabrous surface can be formed on the exterior casing surface by reducing the exterior surface of the casing or by adding particulate material to this surface. Thus, the conduit may be subjected to knurling, abrading, etching or quilting procedures; or a particulate solid such as sand, rock, gravel, shell, frit, metal, metal shavings and the like can be applied to the exterior casing surface by means of a suitable adhesive material. Particularly disclosed in Scott et al is the use of sand in an adhesive matrix formed of an epoxy resin.
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a new and improved well-completion process and structure providing for an enhanced hydraulic bond between a well casing and a surrounding cement sheath. The structure of the present invention comprises a string of casing disposed within a well extending to a subterranean location within the earth's crust. A wrapping of a metal wire is disposed about the outer surface of the casing in a conformation providing a plurality of helical turns which crisscross one another. The well is provided with a cement sheath in the annulus about the casing. The cement sheath encompasses the metal wire to provide a bond between the cement and the casing surface. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the metal wire has a plurality of protrusions extending into the cement sheath.
In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a well-completion process in which a cement-coated conduit is installed within a well. In carrying out this process, a metal wire is secured to the conduit at a first location thereon. The wire is pulled under tension and wrapped about the conduit in a manner providing a first series of successive helical turns about the conduit. The direction of wrapping of the metal wire is then reversed at a second location on the conduit spaced longitudinally from the first location and the wire is then wrapped about the conduit to provide a second series of successive helical turns which overlap the turns in the first series. The conduit is then installed in the well at the desired location and a slurry of hydraulic cement is flowed into the annulus about the conduit. The slurry is allowed to set, thus forming a cement sheath which encompasses the metal wire and is bonded to the conduit.
