[0148] The undercoating layer can also include, but is not limited to, polymers such as polystyrene and substituted polystyrenes, polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(urethane)s, polyacrylates and polymethacrylates, polyacrylamides and polymethacrylamides, polyesters, polysiloxanes, polyethers, poly(orthoester), poly(carbonates), poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s, polyfluorocarbons, PEEK, Teflon, silicones, epoxy resins, KEVLAR.RTM., NOMEX.RTM., DACRON.RTM., HYTREL.RTM., PEBAX.RTM., SURLYN.RTM., nylon, polyalkenes, phenolic resins, PTFE, natural and synthetic elastomers, adhesives and sealants, polyolefins, polysulfones, polyacrylonitrile, biopolymers such as polysaccharides and natural latex copolymers thereof, and combinations thereof.
[0149] The precoated substrate can then be further functionalized using the coating methods described below.
[0150] In the case where a greater density of non-fouling material is desired, the creation of microstructure on the substrate surface can create more area for grafting non-fouling materials from the surface, without increasing the apparent surface area of the article. For polymeric substrates, including hydrogel networks, this surface morphology can be created through appropriate polymer structural design. One example of this methodology is the growth of surface tethered dendrimeric polymers. Each generation of the dendrimer effectively doubles the number of zwitterionic sites presenting. Other polymer architectures include brush polymers, such as brush copolymers, comb polymers, such as comb copolymers, linear and branched copolymers, crosslinked polymers, hydrogels, polymer blends, and combinations thereof.
[0151] Surface Modifications
[0152] In general, a non-fouling polymeric material is grafted from a substrate into which one or more polymerization initiators have been incorporated. In one embodiment, the non-fouling polymeric material is grafted from a substrate that is a composite of two or more materials, e.g., an underlying material such as a metal, ceramic, glass, semi-metal, polymer or other material with a polymeric or other material coating thereon (e.g., an undercoating or a precoating as previously described herein). For example, in one embodiment, the non-fouling polymeric material is grafted from a polymeric undercoat layer, such as a polyurethane layer which overlies a metal or ceramic bulk. By way of further example, in one embodiment the non-fouling polymeric material is grafted from a polymeric undercoat layer, such as a polyurethane layer which overlies a polymeric bulk, such as polyurethane.
