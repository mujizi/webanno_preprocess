[0072] Seven grams of C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3 having a specific surface area of 90 m.sup.2/g, 20.0 mmol of sodium ((4-aminobenzoylamino)-methane-1,1-diyl)bisphosphonate, 57.0 mmol of nitric acid and 200 mL of pure water were mixed at room temperature and 6,000 rpm by a Silverson mixer. After minutes, a solution with 57.0 mmol of sodium nitrite dissolved in a small amount of water was added into this mixture, and mixing was further conducted. The mixing was conducted for 1 hour in a state in which the temperature had reached 60.degree. C. by the addition and mixing. Thereafter, the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 10.0 with an aqueous potassium hydroxide solution. After 30 minutes, this mixture was subjected to ultrafiltration with 20 parts of pure water, and water was further added to disperse the pigment in such a manner that the content of the pigment is 10.0% by mass, thereby preparing a pigment dispersion. By the above-described process, was obtained Pigment Dispersion K in a state in which C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3 in which a bisphosphonic acid group whose counter ion was potassium was bonded to the surface of the pigment particle through an atomic group containing --C.sub.6H.sub.4--CONH-- (benzamide structure) was dispersed in water. The surface charge amount of the self-dispersion pigment prepared above was measured by the method described above and was found to be 0.43 mmol/g. Incidentally, the pH of the Pigment Dispersion K was 10.0, and the average particle size of the pigment was 120 nm.
Preparation of Pigment Dispersion L
[0073] In a state of being cooled to 5.degree. C., 8.28 mmol of 4-amino-phthalic acid was added into a solution with 60 mmol of concentrated hydrochloric acid dissolved in 5.5 g of water. A container containing this solution was then placed in an ice bath, thereby constantly keeping the solution at a temperature not higher than 10.degree. C. In this state, a solution with 21.2 mmol of sodium nitrite dissolved in 9 g of water at 5.degree. C. was added into this solution. After this solution was stirred additionally for minutes, 6 g of Black Pearls 880 (product of Cabot) having a specific surface area of 220 m.sup.2/g was added under stirring. Thereafter, the stirring was conducted additionally for 15 minutes, the resultant slurry was filtered through filter paper (trade name: Toyo Filter Paper No. 2; product of Advantec), and the resultant particle was fully washed with water. This particle was dried in an oven controlled to 110.degree. C. to prepare a self-dispersion carbon black. In addition, water was added to the resultant self-dispersion carbon black, the pH of the resultant mixture was adjusted to 10.0 with an aqueous potassium hydroxide solution, and the pigment was dispersed in such a manner that the content of the pigment is 10.0% by mass, thereby preparing a dispersion liquid. By the above-described process, was obtained Pigment Dispersion L in a state in which a carbon black in which a phthalic acid group whose counter ion was potassium was bonded to the surface of the carbon black particle was dispersed in water. Incidentally, the content of the pigment in the Pigment Dispersion L prepared above was 10.0% by mass, the pH thereof was 10.0, and the average particle size of the pigment was 120 nm. In addition, the surface charge amount of the pigment as measured by the method described above was 0.34 mmol/g.
Preparation of Pigment Dispersion M
[0074] Twenty-five grams of Black Pearls 880 (product of Cabot) having a specific surface area of 220 m.sup.2/g and a solution with 24.5 mmol of sulfanilic acid dissolved in hot water were mixed, and stirring was conducted until the temperature of the solution reached 30.degree. C. Thereafter, 64.0 mmol of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added, and a solution with 23.9 mmol of sodium nitrite dissolved in a small amount of water was added over 1 hour. After pure water was then added, and stirring was conducted, the pH of the resultant mixture was adjusted to 9.0 with an aqueous potassium hydroxide solution. Thereafter, water was evaporated in an oven until the content of the pigment reached 10. % by mass. The mixture was further filtered through a filter having a pore size of 1.2 .mu.m to disperse the pigment in such a manner that the content of the pigment is 10.0% by mass, thereby preparing a pigment dispersion. By the above-described process, was obtained Pigment Dispersion M in a state in which a carbon black in which a sulfonic acid group was bonded to the surface of the pigment particle was dispersed in water. The surface charge amount of the self-dispersion pigment prepared above was measured by the method described above and was found to be 0.34 mmol/g. Incidentally, the pH of the Pigment Dispersion M was 10.0, and the average particle size of the pigment was 120 nm.
