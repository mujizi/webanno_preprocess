[0030] For light load HCCI operation, an injection of fuel totaling perhaps one third that of the full load delivery quantity is required in a timing window that may coincide with the intake or compression stroke. For EGA trap regeneration, a similar quantity of fuel may need to be injected as a post-injection late in the expansion stroke or early exhaust stroke. The problem faced by these supplemental injection requirements is that the nozzle spray pattern and nozzle or nozzle openings, which has been optimized for diesel combustion, is not optimum for the early HCCI or the late post-injections.
[0031] These injections take place at points in the cycle when the air density is low, and the piston is far down the bore. Accordingly, and if the fuel is dispersed during this point via a nozzle opening configured for "normal diesel" combustion there is high probability that the injected fuel will impinge on the cylinder wall where it may wash away lubricant and also drain past the pistons into the sump. This unintended consequence can lead to excessive and undesirable engine wear.
[0032] One proposal to ameliorate this negative effect, is to execute these supplemental injections at a pressure very much lower than the main diesel combustion injection events, with the expectation that with lower spray momentum, less fuel will reach the cylinder wall and thus reduce the magnitude of the problem. To a large extent, this solution is dependant upon the capabilities of the FIE being considered since most systems are not capable of shot-to-shot pressure modulation. However, certainly in the case of early HCCI injection, very fine atomization is required to achieve the necessary near-homogeneous air/fuel mixture, and this would be difficult to achieve when injecting a relatively small amount of fuel, at low pressure, from a relatively high flow-area nozzle. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention addresses this issue.
[0033] As discussed herein, a more ideal solution would allow the supplemental injections to be made under conditions where a better match between injection pressure, nozzle flow area, and spray plume targeting occurs. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention combines the concept of a Variable Area Nozzle (VAN) or Variable Orifice Nozzle (VON) with colliding sprays. A variable area nozzle or variable orifice nozzle may use an inner and outer needle to control a lower and upper row of orifices respectively. Controlled partial lift of the nozzle needle (outer) exposes the upper row of holes, while full needle lift (outer and inner) exposes all holes. This approach requires close dynamic control of needle lift, which is possible with certain designs of three-way control valve, and also with piezo-electric actuators. In addition, the concept of impinging or colliding sprays is used as an aid to improve atomization, improve spray breakup and thus provide more rapid air entrainment prior to combustion as well as providing a means for influencing spray pattern.
[0034] In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention, and for use in engines where supplemental injections are required (as outlined above) an injector for providing a variable area nozzle and colliding spray geometry is disclosed. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the nozzle will have a lower row of holes or openings and an upper row of holes or openings for selective dispersal therethrough. The lower holes may be conventionally located in the nozzle sac with a cone angle optimized for the main combustion system, or slightly greater. The upper row of holes will have the same number of holes and they will lie in the same axial plane as the lower holes. Alternatively, fewer upper holes are provided and the resulting lower holes which do not have a corresponding upper hole aligned therewith are drilled to provide a resulting plume that is either the same as the resultant of the colliding sprays or is configured for dispersement corresponding to a top dead center piston position.
