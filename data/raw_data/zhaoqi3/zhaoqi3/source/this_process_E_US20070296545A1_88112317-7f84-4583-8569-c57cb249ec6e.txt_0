[0108] The first mode is the simplest method to prevent an unauthorized key device from gaining access to a lock device. All that is necessary is that the lock device to require a simple password or pass code from the key device. When a key device incorporates a user interface, even this simple process can comprise several steps. FIG. 10 is a schematic representation of an exemplary embodiment of the subject invention in the form of a process 600 for dynamically controlling lock device and key device interactions. The key device initiates dialogue 602 by connecting to the lock device and proffering access credentials. The lock device decides whether to respond 604. On refusal, an improper access attempt may be reported 612. This reporting may occur immediately. A history of such events may be maintained additionally in either or both the lock device 22 and the key device 24. On acceptance the key device may require 606 the user to re-enter the user's pass code or a pass code specific to that lock device 607, in which case the key device will prompt the user 608 and record the pass code provided 610, and either the key device or lock device will determine whether the proper code has been entered. Again, all failed attempts may be reported as such 612. The second mode involves dialogue with other devices on the control network through the network communication channel of the key device. In this mode, the lock device requires that the key provide proof that it is currently authorized by the network to access the lock. This may either mean local network devices, such as a cash register or database system, or remote network devices, such as databases at remote facilities connected via telephony or the Internet.
[0109] The necessary secure communication may be achieved by means of either encryption or authentications which are known in the art. In any case, the key device must relay the communication from the lock device to the networks, since the lock device preferably has no network connection of its own independent of the key device.
[0110] Referring again to FIG. 10, an exemplary embodiment of this process is depicted beginning at step 614. The lock device determines whether the credential of the key device or the user of the key device is to be confirmed through dialogue with the local database. In the case that local authorization is required, the key device enables and optionally participates in a dialogue between the lock device and the local database 616. The lock device decides whether this process terminates favorably for the user request 618. Similarly, the lock device may require confirmation of access credentials through dialogue with a remote database 620. If yes, this initiates a process involving the lock device, the key, the remote database, and optionally the local database 622. The lock device weighs the outcome of this process 624 and may then unlock 626, report the unlocking 628, and proceed to an optional relocking process 630.
[0111] Consider the example of a delivery person looking to restock a secure razor blade dispensing fixture. Using prior art systems, the delivery person could carry a different key for each fixture on his route. Using the present invention, the delivery person could carry a single key device which is authorized by a remote database of the store chain headquarters. Upon arrival in the store, if the delivery person's key device is not listed and authorized in memory of the lock device, the lock device can request that the key device allow the lock device to query the local database regarding the authority of the delivery person. If the local database is unaware of the credential status of the delivery person, it in turn could initiate a connection to the remote database to verify that the delivery person is authorized to gain access to certain fixtures in that store for the purpose of replenishing inventory. A random key can be deployed to a random store where a random fixture has also been deployed. Together the lock device, the key device, and the network devices could construct the necessary records to make the appropriate access decision, and require no human intervention to do so.
[0112] In a third mode, a lock device may control access granted to key devices by shifting the codes required for entry. Thus, instead of keeping the pass code fixed, the lock device shifts the code based on a trigger condition, such as, but not limited to, the passage of time, the number of times that the key device and the lock device have interacted, etc. Unlike the second mode, the third mode does not require that the lock device be in communication with the network via the key device. The shifting of the code is done by the lock device independent of actions by the network. The key device must be able to produce the new codes required by the lock device. The key device may be arranged with the necessary information or computational tools to do this. Alternatively, the key device may receive the new codes or elements necessary to generate the new codes from the network.
