According to experiences, the above process is very expensive, demanding much manual labor and interference with the environment. For these reasons this process for cases involving 6-8 m depth is more and more avoided.
Such process for the construction of a drain system is known from Hungarian patent specification No. 178 870, where effective deep drain systems are built with dry cutting in stable, e.g. clayey soils. This process utilizes the property present in the more cohesive soils, that the walls of a 7-8 m deep pit remain stable for a short time, until the drain pipe and suction body are built in. Prior to building the drain system, such wide working area is required as to be suitable for the safe traffic of the bulldozers and transport vehicles. The drain pipes are lowered manually and with bulldozers into the trench excavated with a trench-dredger, and laid into a dry concrete bed. Then the drain pipe is covered with crushing as suction body, followed with sandy gravel covered with geotextile.
According to experience, the use of this process at a depth of 8 m is uncertain, caving-in of the pits is frequent, requiring complicated and costly restoration. Further shortcoming of the process is, that it cannot be used in depth beyond 10 m, and in cohesionless, e.g. sandy soils, or when such layers alternate.
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention is aimed at elimination of the above shortcomings, and to realize a process for the construction of a drain system, which satisfies the existing hydrogeological and soil mechanical requirements in optional depth and under any soil or layer conditions.
