Because the primary circuit 16 must know when a transmission is about to occur, it must have some way of being triggered by the start of the transmission. This is accomplished by preceding the 3-bit encoded error signal by a single HI bit. In this way, a positive transition always starts a transmission event, and the receiver 42 (FIG. 2) can simply stand open, waiting for a transition to start it up.
In order to improve the noise immunity and confidence in fault transmission, a multiply redundant logic is preferably utilized. When a fault occurs, the encoded status word is actually transmitted three times in rapid succession. This triplet of data is fed to the three 3-bit shift registers 50 (FIG. 4) to correct any single-bit errors, and to reject indecipherable data.
Fault transmissions that coincide with a change in CMD are prone to occasional errors. To circumvent this problem, a CMD change detector 98 monitors CMD and, when a transition occurs, feedback is stopped by resetting the transmitter 96. After a predetermined amount of time, the transmitter 96 is restarted.
Turning now to FIG. 7, there is shown a schematic diagram of the high voltage section of the secondary circuit 20. The low voltage circuits discussed in FIG. 6 require a 5 VDC power supply for proper operation. Coincidentally, the power transistors 14 require a -5 VDC Gate drive in the OFF state for proper noise immunity and reliable operation in modular packages. The rail to rail voltage required from the transformer 18 is then 15-(-5)=20 V (nom). Thus, low to high voltage level shifters 100 as well as high to low voltage level shifters 102 are utilized to shift the voltage levels accordingly.
Before the power supplies have come up to normal operating range, the drive and control circuits cannot be guaranteed to work properly. In particular, during power up and power down transient conditions, it is possible for false commands to be issued that could cause failure of the external power transistors 14. This effect must be eliminated by measuring the supply voltages, and ignoring all inputs until the voltages are within tolerance. The under voltage detection circuit 60 measures these voltages, compares them to predetermined reference values, and provides corresponding fault signals if necessary.
