EXAMPLES
Example 1
[0038] A 15% solid polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), leuco methylene blue (LMB), 1-methoxy-2-propanol solution was made in a nitrogen atmosphere. (Note the LMB used in the examples was stored in an environment to minimize moisture and light exposure, unless otherwise specified.) Using this solution, the interior walls of glass vials were coated and then left upside-down to dry in a nitrogen atmosphere. After 12 hours of drying, absorbance of the interior walls was measured. The absorbance was again measured after 6 hours and 22 hours of exposure to air. FIG. 3 illustrates the spectral changes observed in the vials after exposure to air. After 22 hours, the vials turned from a slightly tinted color to an intense blue/green coloration corresponding to the formation of methylene blue, and allowing authentication and detection of vial tampering.
Example 2
[0039] Three LMB (Tipsoc, benzoyl LMB, and t-Boc LMB) dyes were explored for their ability to selectively oxidize to methylene blue when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Polycarbonate disc substrates were spin coated with a 15 wt % PMMA solution in 1-methoxy-2-propanol (Dowanol.TM. PM) containing 1 wt % of the LMB dye and either 0 wt %, 1.5 wt %, or 3 wt % of Sn(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, or 0 wt % or 1 wt % of camphor sulfonic acid, wherein the weight percentages were based on a total weight of the solution. Half of the Tipsoc sample disks were then coated with a polyvinyl alcohol solution in water (a polyvinyl alcohol coating forms an oxygen barrier). Half of the samples were stored in a room temperature nitrogen (N.sub.2) environment, while the other half was stored in a humid (60% to 80% relative humidity) at 55.degree. C., N.sub.2 environment (pre-heating). Half of each disk was masked and then the disk was subjected to 14 seconds of UV radiation via a Xenon lamp. The difference in absorbance between the two sides of the disk was measured for the duration of the experiment.
