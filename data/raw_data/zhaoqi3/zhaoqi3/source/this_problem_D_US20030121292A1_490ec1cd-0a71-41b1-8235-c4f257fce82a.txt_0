[0040] According to FIG. 10 to 12, the needle part 3 contains a rear side 3g with which it is supported on the base of the associated needle cylinder channel, and a front side 3h. The needle shaft 3a is provided on its front end face with a guide channel 15, which is incorporated into said end face and extends parallel to the longitudinal direction, said guide channel being able to extend across the entire length or, as FIG. 10 shows, only over a part of the length of the needle shaft 3a. In the embodiment, the guide channel 15 is configured in a guide portion 3i (cf. in particular FIG. 12), which is disposed in an upper portion of the needle shaft 3a, which adjoins the cheek portion 3e, and extends perpendicularly to the rear side 3g up to a greater height than the remaining part of the needle shaft 3a. The guide channel 15 is provided with a cover 16 orientated towards the front side 3h at least partially, said cover connecting two lateral cheeks forming the guide channel 15 to each other. The production of the guide channel 15 is effected for example in that (FIG. 12) the needle shaft 3a is machined in the region of the guide portion 3i from the direction of its front and rear side 3g or 3h with respectively one small circular saw 17 or 18 moved in the direction of the arrows. The circular saw 17 thereby penetrates from the rear side 3g up to the cover 16 in the guide portion 3i, as a result of which a portion of the guide channel 15 which is open towards the rear side 3g is produced. In contrast, with the circular saw 18 attached from the front side 3h, the slot- or groove-shaped recess lying between the breast portion 3d and the cover 16 is produced on the one hand in the cheek portion 3e and, on the other hand, a part of the guide channel 15 is produced, which lies on the side of the cover 16 remote from the needle hook 3b and penetrates only partly into the needle shaft 3a. Consequently, the guide channel contains a slot-shaped portion penetrating the needle shaft 3a and a groove-shaped portion which is delimited towards the rear side 3g by a base 15a.
[0041] The slide shaft 4 has on the one hand a height h according to FIG. 13 which is essentially the same as the spacing of the base 15a from the cover 16 measured in the same direction and perpendicularly to the rear side 3g. On the other hand, the thickness d1 of the slide shaft 4a measured perpendicularly to the height h and perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction v is essentially the same as the width of the guide channel 15 measured in the same direction and preferably the same across the entire length of the slide shaft 4a. It is therefore possible to insert the slide shaft 3a into the guide channel 15 such that it is guided at the rear on the base 15a, at the front on the underside of the cover 16 covering said base and laterally by the walls of the needle shaft 3a delimiting the slide channel 15. In the remaining part situated between the guide portion 3i and the slide butt 4c, the slide shaft 4a can be supported with its rear side on the front side 3h of the needle shaft 3a and also be guided if necessary in an additional groove of the needle shaft 3a.
[0042] The thickness of the slide hook 4b increases, for reasons which are explained fully further on, corresponding to FIG. 15 within a transition region from the dimension d1 to a greater dimension d2 which is greater than the width of the guide channel 15. It is therefore not possible to introduce the slide part 4 into the guide channel 15 since the slide butt 4c which is too high interferes on the one side and the slide hook 4b which is too thick interferes on the other side with the cover 16. In order to avoid this problem, it is provided according to the invention to configure the slide part 4 in two parts (FIG. 13 to 17) and in addition to provide a first element having the predominant part of the slide shaft 4a and the slide hook 4b and a second element 19 having the slide butt 4c. As in particular FIG. 13 and 14 show, the second element 19 has a thickness which corresponds for example to the thickness of the needle shaft 3a and, on one side orientated towards the slide shaft 4a, has a U-shaped receiving groove 20 into which a lower end 4j of the slide shaft 4a which is distant from the slide hook 3b can be inserted.
[0043] Because of the two-part configuration of the slide part 4, it is possible to introduce the slide shaft 4a with its end 4j corresponding to FIG. 15 from the side of the needle hook 3b into the guide channel 15 and to move it forward in the latter until the slide shaft 4a adopts the position in longitudinal direction v relative to the needle part 3 which can be seen in FIG. 16 and 17. Should it not be possible to move the slide shaft back, which projects backwardly somewhat relative to the slide hook 4b and which is to be positioned on the base 15a of the guide channel 15, past the outwardly situated tip of the needle hook 3b, the slide shaft 4a can be somewhat elastically bent due to its elasticity conditioned by the low thickness d1 and consequently be introduced laterally past the needle hook 3b into the guide channel 15, as indicated in FIG. 15.
[0044] If the slide shaft 4a is disposed correctly in the guide channel 15 (FIG. 16), the element 19 is connected firmly or detachably to the lower end 4j of the slide shaft 4a. The means used for this purpose are arbitrary per se. In the embodiment, it is proposed to provide the end 4j and the element 19 with coupling elements which cooperate in the manner of snap-on connections. For this purpose, the element 19 has for example two pins 21, which protrude transversely through the receiving groove 20 and are connected with the walls of the element 19 delimiting the receiving groove 20 by means of welding, soldering or otherwise, whilst the end 4j obtains at its front side corresponding open edge recesses 22 which can be clipped onto the pins 21. After clipping on the element 19, the slide part 4 is connected then securely and captively but displaceably with the needle part 3 in the direction of the double arrow v. It is thereby assumed that the slide shaft 3a and the element 19 are produced from the normal materials for needles of the type of interest here, in particular from metals.
