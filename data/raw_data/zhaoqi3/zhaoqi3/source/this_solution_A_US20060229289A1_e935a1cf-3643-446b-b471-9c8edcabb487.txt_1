EXAMPLE 10B
1-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-3-methylpyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid
[0141] A solution of Example 10A (4.1 g, 14.8 mmol) in a mixture of THF (20 mL) and water (30 mL) was treated with LiOH.H.sub.2O (0.93 g, 22.2 mmol) in water (10 mL). Methanol was added until a transparent solution formed (20 mL). This solution was heated at 60.degree. C. for overnight and the organic solvents were removed under vacuum. The residual aqueous solution was acidified with 2N HCl to pH 2 and was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic phase was washed with water, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered and concentrated to give Example 10B as a white solid (3.8 g, 97% yield). MS (DCI/NH.sub.3) m/z 264 (M+H).sup.+.
