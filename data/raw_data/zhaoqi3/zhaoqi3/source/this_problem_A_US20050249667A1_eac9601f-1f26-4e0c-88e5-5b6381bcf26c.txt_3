[0464] U.S. Pat. No. 4,871,351 also discloses that "An implanted closed loop system with some degree of external control is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,146,029. In that system, a sensor (either implanted or external) is arranged on the body to sense some kind of physiological, chemical, electrical or other condition at a particular site and produced data which corresponds to the sensed condition at the sensed site. This data is fed directly to an implanted microprocessor controlled medication dispensing device. A predetermined amount of medication is dispensed in response to the sensed condition according to a pre-programmed algorithm in the microprocessor control unit. An extra-corporeal coding pulse transmitter is provided for selecting between different algorithms in the microprocessor control unit. The system of U.S. Pat. No. 4,146,029 is suitable for use in treating only certain ailments such as cardiac conditions. It is unsuitable as a blood glucose control system for example, since (i) it is not practicable to measure the blood glucose concentration continuously with an implanted sensor and (ii) the known system is incapable of dispensing discrete doses of insulin in response to certain events, such as meals and exercise. Furthermore, there are several disadvantages to internal sensors; namely, due to drift, lack of regular calibration and limited life, internal sensors do not have high long-term reliability. If an external sensor is used with the system of U.S. Pat. No. 4,146,029, the output of the sensor must be fed through the patient's skin to the implanted mechanism. There are inherent disadvantages to such a system, namely the high risk of infection. Since the algorithms which control the rate of infusion are programmed into the implanted unit, it is not possible to upgrade these algorithms without surgery. The extra-corporeal controller merely selects a particular one of several medication programs but cannot actually alter a program."
[0465] U.S. Pat. No. 4,871,351 also discloses that "It is an object of the present invention to overcome, or substantially ameliorate the above described disadvantages of the prior art by providing an implantable open loop medication infusion system with a feedback control option"
[0466] The solution to this problem is set forth in claim 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,871,351, which describes: "A medical infusion system intermittently switchable at selected times between an open loop system without feedback and a closed loop system with feedback, said system comprising an implantable unit including means for controllably dispensing medication into a body, an external controller, and an extra-corporeal sensor; wherein said implantable unit comprises an implantable transceiver means for communicating with a similar external transceiver means in said external controller to provide a telemetry link between said controller and said implantable unit, a first reservoir means for holding medication liquid, a liquid dispensing device, a pump connected between said reservoir means and said liquid dispensing device, and a first electronic control circuit means connected to said implantable transceiver means and to said pump to operate said pump; wherein said external controller comprises a second electronic control circuit means connected with said external transceiver means, a transducer means for reading said sensor, said transducer means having an output connected to said second electronic control circuit means, and a manually operable electric input device connected to said second electronic control circuit means; wherein said pump is operable by said first electronic control circuit means to pump said medication liquid from said first reservoir means to said liquid-dispensing deive at a first predetermined rate independent of the output of said extra-corporeal sensor, and wherein said input device or said transducer means include means which selectively operable at intermittent times to respectively convey commands or output of said transducer representing the reading of said sensor to said second control circuit to instruct said first control circuit via said telemetry link to modify the operation of said pump."
[0467] U.S. Pat. No. 4,941,461 describes an electrically actuated inflatable penile erecton device comprised of an implantable induction coil and an implantable pump; the entire disclosure of this United States patent is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. The device of this patent is described, e.g., in claim 1 of the patent, which discloses "An apparatus for achieving a penile erection in a human male, comprising: at least one elastomer cylinder having a root chamber and a pendulous chamber, said elastomer cylinder adapted to be placed in the corpus carvenosum of the penis; an external magnetic field generator which can be placed over some section of the penis which generates an alternating magnetic field; an induction coil contained within said elastomer cylinder which produces an alternating electric current when in the proximity of said alternating magnetic filed which is produced by said external magnetic field generator; and a fluid pumping means located within said elastomer cylinder, said pumping means being operated by the electrical power generated in said induction coil to pump fluid from said root chamber to said pendulous chamber in order to stiffen said elastomer cylinder for causing the erect state of the penis."
[0468] U.S. Pat. No. 5,487,760 discloses an implantable signal transceiver disposed in an artificial heart valve; this transceiver may be used in the process of this invention in accordance with the aforementioned telemetry device; and the entire disclosure of this United States patent is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. Claim 1 of this patent describes: "In combination, an artificial heart valve of the type having a tubular body member, defining a lumen and pivotally supporting at least one occluder, said body member having a sewing cuff covering an exterior surface of said body member; and an electronic sensor module disposed between said sewing cuff and said exterior surface, wherein said sensor module incorporates a sensor element for detecting movement of said at least one occluder between an open and a closed disposition relative to said lumen and wherein said sensor module further includes a signal transceiver coupled to said sensor element, and means for energizing said signal transceiver, and wherein said sensor module includes means for encapsulating said sensor element, signal transceiver and energizing means in a moisture-impervious container."
