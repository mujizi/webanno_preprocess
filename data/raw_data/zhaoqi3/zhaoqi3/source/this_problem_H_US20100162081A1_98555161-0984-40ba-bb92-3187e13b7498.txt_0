[0062] After the read operation for the last word line and the program operation for copyback are completed, an operation for treating the first memory cell block on which the read operation has been performed as an invalid block is executed at step S295. The invalid block processing operation (S295) is optional and may be selectively performed according to the design in the case where it is determined that reliability is compromised, such that the number of error bits abruptly rises.
[0063] The control unit 160 controls an operation for storing the address of the first memory cell block. For example, when the invalid block processing unit 162 generates a signal for an invalid block processing for the first memory cell block, the control unit 160 stores an address of the first memory cell block in a nonvolatile memory device, such as a CAM cell. In another example, the control unit 160 may control the high voltage generation unit 150, the X decoder 140, and the page buffer unit 120 so that the address of the first memory cell block is stored in a memory cell block (e.g., the last memory cell block) for storing status information, from among the memory cell blocks 115 of the memory cell array 110. The corresponding memory cell block is not used for subsequent data storage purposes because of the block address stored in the nonvolatile memory device as described above.
[0064] In the above, the reason why, even when the number of error bits occurred is smaller than the maximum number of error bits that can be corrected, the data stored in the corresponding memory cell block is stored in another memory cell block through a copyback operation and the corresponding memory cell block is then set as an invalid block is described below. If the number of error bits occurred is smaller than the number of error bits that can be corrected, a normal read operation is possible through an ECC processing. However, if the number of error bits occurred is almost the same as the maximum number of error bits that can be corrected and error bits are additionally generated because of a reduction in the data retention characteristic resulting from the leakage current, it makes it impossible to correct the error bits through an ECC processing. Accordingly, before this problem occurs, when it is possible to correct the error bits through the ECC processing, data is moved to a memory cell block having a more stabilized characteristic, and an invalid block processing for a corresponding memory cell block is performed. Reliability characteristics obtained through this operation are described below.
[0065] FIG. 3 is a graph showing a chip fail rate and a raw bit error rate (BER) of blocks according to embodiments 1 and 2 of this disclosure and blocks according to comparison examples 1 and 2. Here, the raw BER refers to the BER that is actually generated when the ECC method is not performed.
[0066] Referring to FIG. 3, in the embodiment 1 of this disclosure, error correction is performed using an ECC method, and, if 4 error bits are included in the unit data 512 bytes, data stored in a corresponding block is programmed into another block according to the method of operating the nonvolatile memory device in accordance with this disclosure, and the corresponding block is treated as being invalid. Furthermore, in the embodiment 2 of this disclosure, error correction is performed through an ECC method, and, if 8 error bits are included in the unit data 512 bytes, data stored in a corresponding block is programmed into another block according to the method of operating the nonvolatile memory device in accordance with this disclosure, and the corresponding block is treated as being invalid. Furthermore, in the comparison example 1 of this disclosure, error correction is performed through an ECC method, but a corresponding block is not treated as being invalid. Also, in the comparison example 2 of this disclosure, error correction is performed through an ECC method, but a corresponding block is not treated as being invalid.
