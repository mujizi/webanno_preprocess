Hydrogenolysis of Poly(DTBn.sub.50 -DTE.sub.50 Carbonate)
Preparation
In a 500 mL round-bottomed flask was placed 15 g of poly(DTBn-DTE carbonate) which contained DTBn and DTE in a 1:1 ratio. To the flask was then added 150 mL of dry DMF and the mixture was stirred until a clear solution was obtained. To this solution were added 3.5 g of 5 percent Pd on BaSO.sub.4 catalyst and 7 mL of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (hydrogen donor). The mixture was stirred at room temperature. A rubber balloon filled with hydrogen gas was attached to the mouth of the flask using a gas inlet adapted. The balloon was replenished with hydrogen as needed. After about 40 h of stirring a 0.5 mL sample was withdrawn, centrifuged, and then precipitated by adding to water with stirring. The precipitate was dried and analyzed by .sup.1 H NMR, which showed complete conversion of the benzyl groups to free acid. The reaction was stopped and the reaction mixture was centrifuged. The supernatant was filtered using 0.45 .mu.M syringe filter in several portions. (A celite bed on a fritted glass funnel can also be used for the filtration.) A clear light yellow filtrate was obtained. The filtrate was added to 1.5 L of deionized water with agitation using a mechanical stirrer. (A high speed blender can also be used for the precipitation to obtain finely divided particles.) The precipitated product was isolated by filtration and washed with 750 mL of water in a high speed blender. The product was dried in a nitrogen stream for 16 h and then dried in a vacuum over at room temperature for two days. For further purification, the product was dissolved in 150 mL of 9:1 methylene chloride-methanol and precipitated with 1.5 L of ether and then dried as above.
The hydrogenation can also be carried out in a PARR hydrogenator at high hydrogen pressures (60 psi). When a hydrogenator is used at high hydrogen pressures, the transfer hydrogen donor, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is not necessary.
