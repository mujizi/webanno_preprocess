Example
[0301] Here is described a predictive example of how the in situ traveling undercut method according to the present invention may be carried out on a trona bed under some depth of significant overburden cover. The trona bed is located about 1500 feet below the surface, and contains virgin trona (that is say, a trona bed not previously mined). The trona bed may range in thickness from only a few feet up to several tens of feet (e.g., from 5 to 30 feet, or 5-15 feet). In this example the trona bed thickness is 10 feet. For this example, the target area is square with 2500 feet for each side, or one quarter square mile. The target trona zone is 10 feet thick by 2500 feet in length and width, dipping to the south at 1% slope. This volume represents approximately 4 million tons of in-place trona.
[0302] Applicants believe that the aerial limitations of this method are only defined by the capabilities of the machines required to layout and operate the solution mining system. Applicants cannot conceive of any geotechnical nor hydraulic related limitation to the aerial extent or shape of the extraction target area. In most practical cases, the trona bed may dip at a grade of about 0.4% to 1.5% or from 1 to 1.5%, but the Applicants believe that the method can be adapted to horizontal or rolling beds as well.
[0303] A tunnel (collection zone) of fairly large diameter (e.g., from 2 to 10 feet) is created, thereby traversing the entire 2500 feet of the southern most edge of the target area and extending onward to the west by from about 200 to 300 feet. A pumping system is then located at the western end of this tunnel. A second tunnel is provided on the northern edge of the trona bed. This second tunnel does not necessarily have to be in the same seam as the target trona bed. Indeed, Applicants conceive that the second tunnel could actually be at the surface. The second tunnel in this example is a means for feeding solvent and it provides access to a manifold to direct solvent to conduits positioned inside unlined boreholes. This manifold can be alternatively in another seam or on the surface.
[0304] Using directional drilling techniques, unlined borehole portions are directionally drilled parallel to each other through the trona bed approximately 1 to 2 feet above the bed floor in a north-south orientation (up-dip to down-dip), substantially perpendicular to the first and second tunnels' longitudinal axes. These unlined borehole portions generally have a smaller diameter than the first and second tunnels; for example, these holes may be 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Thus the 1/4 square mile bed of trona which is 10 feet thick is penetrated by 24 boreholes substantially parallel to the bed floor and which are connected at one end to the second lateral tunnel (solvent feeding zone) on the northern (up-dip) boundary and terminate at the other end to the first lateral tunnel (liquor collection zone) on the southern (down-dip) boundary.
