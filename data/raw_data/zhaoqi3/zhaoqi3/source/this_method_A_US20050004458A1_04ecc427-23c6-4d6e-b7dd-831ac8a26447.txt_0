[0017] Research has been conducted on imaging methods using the photoacoustic effect for diagnosing breast cancer (see Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publications Nos. 3-47099). FIG. 13 illustrates the system 100 for acquiring photoacoustic image data, described in non-patent reference 1. The system 100 comprises a laser generator 101, an optical fiber 103, an array of electroacoustic transducer elements 104, and a computer system 105. The laser generator 101 generates light pulses. The optical fiber 103 guides the light pulse to the breast 102 of a subject to be examined. The electroacoustic transducer elements 104 are placed, facing the optical fiber 103. Each element 104 has a concaved surface. The computer system 105 controls transmission of optical pulses, acquires acoustic waves, and reconstructs an image.
[0018] The subject lies on a table, with the breast 102 positioned between the optical fiber 103 and the array of electroacoustic transducer elements 104. Then, the tissues in the breast 102 are irradiated with light (laser beam) applied from the optical fiber 103. The blood components in the internal tissues generate acoustic waves. The electroacoustic transducer elements 104 receive the acoustic waves.
[0019] In this method, the concentration of hemoglobin in blood, for example, can be measured with higher sensitivity than the concentration of any other substance components, by virtue of the photoacoustic effect based on a predetermined wavelength. Therefore, a photoacoustic image of a tumor tissue in the breast can be more readily detected than an image obtained by an ultrasonic diagnosis apparatus, X-ray apparatus, MRI apparatus, or the like, which has hitherto been used. This is because vascularization, which is the number of blood vessels, and the blood flow rate are higher in the tumor tissue than in normal tissues, in order to accommodate the higher metabolic activity in the tumor. Increased vascularization occurs through generation of more blood vessels in the tumor and its surroundings. Generation of new blood vessels in tumors is known as angiogenesesis.
[0020] The methods disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKOKU Publication Nos. 3-47099 and 5-58735, and Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication Nos. 10-189 and 11-235331 are designed to measure the concentration of a specific substance in a local region. However, none of these publications teaches techniques of providing an image showing concentration distributions.
[0021] The method described in A. A. Oraevsky, et al., "Laser optoacoustic imaging of breast cancer in vivo", Proc. SPIE, Vol. 4256: pages. 6-15, 2001, lacks operability. This is because, the optical fiber 103 and an array of electroacoustic transducer elements 104 opposite to each other, and the subject lies with the breast 102 held between them. It is desirable to form the optical fiber 103 integral with the array of electroacoustic transducer elements 104, because air must be expelled, as much as possible, from the gap between the array and the subject, particularly when an image is reconstructed from the acoustic waves generating from inside the subject.
