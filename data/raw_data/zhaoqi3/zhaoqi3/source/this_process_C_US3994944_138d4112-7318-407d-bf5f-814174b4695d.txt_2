The di-n-butyl ether complex, either with trialkyl aluminum or with alkyl auminum halides, has proved particularly advantageous according to the process of the present invention. Alkyl tin trichlorides are obtained in an amount of about 85 - 95 weight percent. This can be increased to 97 to 99 percent if the SnCl.sub.4 is also employed as an etherate complex.
The process according to the present invention for the preparation of alkyl tin trichlorides is explained in more detail below.
First, the alkyl aluminum compound is mixed with the desired donor in a known fashion in a suitable apparatus under a protective atmosphere. Then the alkyl aluminum-complex compound so formed is combined, also under a protective atmosphere, with SnCl.sub.4 or, optionally, with a mixture of SnCl.sub.4 and di-n-butyl ether in such a mol ratio that one alkyl group is present for each Sn atom. This process is suitably carried out by introducing the SnCl.sub.4 into the reaction apparatus and allowing the alkyl aluminum complex compound to flow thereinto, with good mixing. Since this is an exothermic process, good cooling is employed to maintain a low temperature during the reaction. As mentioned above, the reaction is carried out at temperatures between 20.degree. and 70.degree. C., preferably between 40.degree. and 70.degree. C., and suitably at about 40.degree. C. At higher temperatures, a larger portion of by-products is formed. Additionally, there is a danger of decomposition of the donor complex of the aluminum compound.
At the end of the reaction and post-reaction, the reaction mixture is suitably diluted with an appropriate solvent and poured into ice water. A suitable solvent is di-n-butyl ether, for example. (Dilution with di-n-butyl ether can be omitted if this material is added at the beginning to the SnCl.sub.4.) The subsequent addition of di-n-butyl ether has no further influence on the product composition and is solely to permit better working up of the reaction product. Namely, if the addition of a solvent such as di-n-butyl ether is omitted, then the aqueous phase must be extracted several times with, for example, di-n-butyl ether, particularly in the preparation of RSnCl.sub.3 having a short-chain R group. After phase separation and distillative removal of the di-n-butyl ether, alkyl tin trichloride is obtained in admixture with varying small amounts of higher akylated tin chlorides or tetraalkyl tin.
A better understanding of the present invention and of its many advantages will be had by referring to the following specific examples, given by way of illustration.
