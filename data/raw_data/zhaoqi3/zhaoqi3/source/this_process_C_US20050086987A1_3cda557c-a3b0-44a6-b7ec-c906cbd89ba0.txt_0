[0022] Among the important amino acids enriched in the resulting organic composition of the present invention are the acidified amino acids, e.g., glutamic acid (generally 6%-10% of soluble nitrogen), arginine (3-5% of soluble nitrogen), and proline (2-4% of soluble nitrogen). In addition, phenolics result in the range of 0.1%-0.2%. The sulfur content, from geothermal water, is also enriched from, for example, 0.05%-0.1%. Acidified amino acids are key organic stimulators of the stress modulating proline-linked pentose phosphate pathway. Acidified amino acids provide benefits, for example, to stimulate soil conditioning micro-organisms and plant promoting micro-organisms. Fish extracts employed in compositions of the present invention provide small fatty acids that are anti-microbial against acid intolerant plant bacterial pathogens.
[0023] Bio-processing fermentation, for example, using geothermal water (e.g., Icelandic) high in sulfur and minerals and the enhanced stress modulating natural compounds derived from seaweed together with the fish extracts described herein, provides key advantages. Accordingly, preferred water for use in fermenting compositions of the present invention is geothermal water enriched in sulfur, e.g., from Icelandic geothermal sources.
[0024] Liquefaction is carried out by enzymes already present in the fish. Liquefaction is entirely due to autolysis which can be enhanced by temperature control. At higher temperature of 20-30.degree. C. liquefaction occurs rapidly. However, this process is slower at lower temperatures. See, e.g., Tatterson, I. N., et al., J. Sci. Food Agric., 25: 369-379 (1974). Acids may be added to provide favorable conditions for enzyme activity and inhibition of spoilage bacteria. Formic acid of about 3% has been used in many studies with good results. However, citric acid and lactic acid from beverage and milk processing can be used effectively from 0.5% to 5%.
[0025] The acidic treatment (lactic and formic acid) is performed in a blend with Icelandic seaweed with Icelandic geothermal water high in sulfur. This is uniquely targeted to caplein fish species at low levels of fat content (1%-5%) after spawning and, for example, can be extended to other pelagic fish species such as menhaden and herring. Once the fish silage-seaweed is made from sulfur geothermal water, it becomes enriched in amino acids glutamic acid, proline and arginine. Caplein species, for example, about 1000 kg or its multiples are hauled by fishing boats from coastal Iceland and added to tanks ranging from 1000 kg capacity to 12,000 kg capacity. The fish can be ground in some cases before adding. The moisture content of fish is about 75%-80% and ash content of about 3.54.5%. The oil content at this stage ranges from 1%-5% (low fat) following spawning. The total nitrogen content is about 1.7% to 2.0%. Fresh fish is added to tanks with and without grinding and a combination, for example, of 2%-3% lactic acid from dairy processing waste in Iceland and 1%-2% formic acid. The enzymatic breakdown and natural fermenting (natural bacterial flora in fish gut and enzymes) fish silage is converted into a homogenous mince. To this about 10%-20% of algae, preferably Icelandic algae, may be added in geothermal water blend in the first 1-3 days after the initial fermentation and further allowed to ferment and enzymatically be converted into soluble nitrogen containing both the seaweed and soluble fish protein.
