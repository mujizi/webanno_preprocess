[0079] Melt pressed films were punched with a 5 mm diameter and weighed. The films were then immersed in a vial containing 1 mL deionized water. The films were agitated at a rate of 5 rpm using a GyroTwister (Labnet International Inc.) over a period of four weeks. At the end of each week, the films were dried under vacuum at 40.degree. C. overnight and weighed. The weight difference was plotted over time. This experiment was carried out in triplicate for each time period.
Preparation of Aqueous Dispersions/Nanoparticles from Butyl Rubber-PEO Graft Copolymers
[0080] A 10 mg/mL solution of the graft copolymer was prepared in filtered THF. To this solution, filtered deionized water was added rapidly via syringe to provide solutions containing either 100%, 70%, 50%, or 30% THF. The resulting solutions were then dialyzed overnight against water using a regenerated cellulose membrane (Spectra/Por) with a molecular weight cut-off of 12000-14000 g/mol. Dynamic light scattering was performed on ZetaSizer Nano instrument from Malvern Instruments.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
[0081] A drop of the nanoparticie suspension (.about.3 mg/mL) was transferred via pipette to a carbon formvar grid and was left for 1 minute. The excess solution was removed. The grid was stained with the vapour of OsO.sub.4 in a sealed container, for 2 hours. Imaging was performed using a Phillips CM10 microscope operating at 80 kV with a 40 .mu.m aperture.
