The present invention relates generally to an apparatus for and a method of supplying fluidizable material from a storage vessel to a downstream process or apparatus. More specifically, the present invention relates to a transportable container for fluidizable solids that may be used to supply a downstream process or apparatus with the solids.
It is generally known in the field of solids material handling to provide fluidizable material (i.e., pulverized, powdered, or granulated material) in a carton or container, such as a cardboard carton or container. The contents of this package are then typically transferred to a large supply or distribution hopper. The distribution hopper is used to supply the material to other downstream hoppers, such as gun hoppers, which are generally positioned at the locations where the material is to be used. Thus, there are at least three discreet steps in this prior art process, including providing the package containing the original material, transferring the material to a supply or distribution hopper, and finally supplying one or more end-use hoppers where the material is actually used. The large supply or distribution hoppers used in this process tend to be of large capacity and located a significant distance from the actual end-use locations where the material is to be used. Long-distance transfer systems are, therefore, required to transfer the contents of the supply or distribution hoppers to the individual downstream locations. Such long-distance transfer systems require a substantial capital outlay to install and are expensive to maintain. These systems also typically require capital outlay to install and maintain primary and/or gun hoppers at the point of application.
Transportable containers for fluidizable material that may be provided directly at the site where the material is to be used and that may otherwise obviate the need for large supply or distribution hoppers and distribution systems to transport the material are, therefore, desired.
The present invention provides for a transportable container and method for supplying fluidizable solids first to a manufacturing facility from a supplier, and then within the facility, such as from an initial point to a downstream process or apparatus without the need to transfer material from one container to another. "Fluidizable solids" and/or "solids" as used herein refer to pulverized, powdered, or granulated material, and include, for example, cement, sand, lime, chalk, flour, sugar, plastic, powder coating, and other similar finely divided material. The transport container of the present invention is generally comprised of a storage container and an agitator, which could be in the form of an agitator blade, angled fluidization plate, or vibration. The storage container includes a top end, a bottom end, and a sidewall extending therebetween for containing the fluidizable solids. The storage container defines an air inlet port for introducing fluidizing air into the storage container and a solids outlet port for discharging the solids from the storage container. The agitator is provided at the bottom end of the storage container for mixing the solids in the fluidizing air, and maintaining homogeneity of solids in the fluidizing air. The bottom end of the storage container may further comprise a transport skid for moving the transportable container.
