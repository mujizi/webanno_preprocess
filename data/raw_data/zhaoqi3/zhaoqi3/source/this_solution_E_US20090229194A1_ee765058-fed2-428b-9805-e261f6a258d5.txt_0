[0032] The inner IT modular secure room structure (inner module) employed in the modular containment structure can be referred to as the Smart Shelter. The Smart Shelter is built within the given steel ISO Container and has a modular construction made of panels made to size to adequate the ISO container in such way that can accommodate IT equipment inside. This solution allows: [0033]Modularity: although the Smart Shelter creates a tight and enclosed room by itself inside the PMDC container, in a given moment, some panels could be removed and stack together several PMDCs, creating a single room space. [0034]Fast and clean construction: using modular panels allows a fast and clean construction process. Mechanical assembly clean and dust free [0035]Optimized adaptability to the Container's dimensions: minimum space lost between the Smart Shelter walls and ISO Container structure room walls. [0036]Construction with no intermediate room columns. [0037]Re-use of room panels: recyclable components. [0038]Laqued Smart Shelter walls surface finishing: keeps the inner rooms clean for IT equipment. [0039]High mechanical resistance of panels (2 sheets of steel and intermediate high density mineral fiber compound). [0040]Electro-Magnetic Shielding. [0041]Joints between panels are dovetailed and sealed with protective silicone and special profiles to allow a high level protection against intrusion.
[0042] For special cases or applications where extra thermal insulation may be required, panels of 120 MM thickness can be used. The inner module comprises wall and ceiling panels which provide the adequate insulation and protection to install IT equipment inside of the modular containment structure. The inner walls and ceiling are designed with a single panel wall structure of 80 mm thickness, with two layers of laqued galvanized steel (total 1 mm steel) which provide stiffness. The inner laqued white color gives a smooth finish to the panels and mitigates the need for paint or other special finishing treatment. The finish also maintains a clean surface for the walls which is preferred if not required for certain types of environments such as IT equipment or clean room environments.
[0043] Within the inner module, all structure joints are dovetailed and can be sealed with silicone for perfect sealing. Each panel is also dovetailed to one another to guarantee perfect fitting with the other, avoiding humidity leaks and ensuring perfect fitting when either mounted horizontally or vertically. Panels are 100% reusable and can be easily relocated into new sites in a matter of hours, thus making the modular containment structure investment a long-term value asset, rather than a one-time work.
