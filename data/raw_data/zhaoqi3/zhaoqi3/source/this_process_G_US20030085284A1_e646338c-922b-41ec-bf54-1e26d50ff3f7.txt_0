[0059] In step 525, a test is performed to determine whether the trigger switch on the handheld head has been pressed. If the trigger switch has not been pressed, the system will not attempt to read the barcode or other symbol or indicia using a flying-spot scan, and control returns to step 522 so that another attempt can be made using an imaging read. The test of step 525 may be included for safety reasons, to prevent, for example, the unintentional discharge of laser light.
[0060] If the test of step 525 determines that the trigger has been pressed, control then passes to step 526, where the controller 300 adjusts the parameters for the upcoming flying-spot scan, preferably based on previously performed flying-spot scans. These parameters may include, for example, the speed of the scanning spot. Next, in step 527, the system attempts to read the target barcode using a flying-spot scan. Details of implementing this step (including, for example, reading and decoding the edge data) have been described previously herein.
[0061] Next, in step 528, a test is performed to determine whether the attempted read (in step 527) was successful. If the attempted read was successful, processing continues in step 529, where the data corresponding to the target barcode or other symbol or indicia is reported. If, on the other hand, the attempted read in step 527 was not successful, processing returns to step 522, which is the start of the imaging reading routine. This process is repeated to effectuate reading of the bar code, symbol or other indicia.
[0062] A number of variations to the program depicted in FIG. 3 will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the specification, drawings and claims herein. For example, instead of switching between the imaging and flying-spot reading modes after each unsuccessful reading attempt, the system may remain in either of those modes until a predetermined number of unsuccessful reading attempts have occurred.
[0063] In another embodiment, the integrated optical reader 90 alternates between reading with the flying-spot front end 100 and the imaging front end 200, and performs data capture using one reading method in parallel with decoding data gathered using a different reading method.
