DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0044] The following clearly describes the technical solutions in the embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of the present invention. Apparently, the described embodiments are a part rather than all of the embodiments of the present invention. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of the present invention.
[0045] A parallel-interleaving technique is an effective solution to improve a power capacity of a power converter. Using a parallel-interleaving solution can conveniently increase the power class of a converter and reduce input and output current ripples; in addition, it can also accelerate the dynamic response of the converter, reduce the volume of magnetic elements in a circuit, and implement automatic current equalization of the converter. Although a multi-level output topology can be implemented by using parallel-interleaved two-level bridge arms in combination with a coupling inductor, this solution requires a filter circuit to filter an output multi-level waveform, which is adverse to suppression of high-order harmonics.
[0046] FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a power conversion circuit 100 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The power conversion circuit 100 includes: a first terminal 110, a second terminal 120, a third terminal 130, N multi-level bridge arms 140 and a coupling inductor 150.
[0047] The first terminal 110 and the second terminal 120 are connected to a direct current. The third terminal 130 is connected to an alternating current. The N multi-level bridge arms 140 include a multi-level bridge arm 1, a multi-level bridge arm 2, . . . , and a multi-level bridge arm N, which are connected in parallel between the first terminal 110 and the second terminal 120, where the N multi-level bridge arms 140 work in a parallel-interleaved manner, where the working in a parallel-interleaved manner refers to working in a phase-interleaved manner, and multiple time-varying levels are generated at an alternating current node of each multi-level bridge arm of the N multi-level bridge arms 140, where the multiple levels are more than two levels. The coupling inductor 150 includes N windings coupled by one common magnetic core, and is configured to form inductances coupled with each other, where one end of each winding of the N windings is connected to an alternating current node of one multi-level bridge arm of the N multi-level bridge arms, and the other end of each winding of the N windings is connected to the third terminal 130, where N is greater than or equal to two.
