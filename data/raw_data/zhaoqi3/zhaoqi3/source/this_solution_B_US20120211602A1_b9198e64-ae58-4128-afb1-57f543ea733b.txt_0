[0007] As illustrated in FIG. 3, the moment generated by the shearing force F that is applied at each stop 24 on the frame 22 is taken up by two opposing reactions, a first reaction R1 at the secondary frame and a second reaction R2 at the edge frame. According to this type of design, the balancing of the forces is done locally opposite each door stop using a corresponding intercostal rib.
[0008] The loading of the door frame 22 is not limited to these radial forces. In a general manner, the door frame is to ensure the integrity of the fuselage.
[0009] According to a first embodiment, all of the elements that constitute the door frame 22 and the skin of the fuselage are metal, whereby the vertical stiffeners 30 and 32 as well as the intercostal ribs 36 are made from thick panels that are machined in a conventional manner. After machining, these different elements are assembled in such a way as to form the substructures in a ladder, and then the skin is next placed on these thus formed substructures. Starting from a metal skin, this solution has the drawback of comprising numerous attachments and has the advantage of having good control of the thickness and successive deposition planes that are parallel to one another.
[0010] So as to reduce the on-board weight of the aircraft, there is a tendency to use composite materials.
[0011] A first variant embodiment of a door frame made of composite material consists in making a first subassembly that comprises the edge frame, the secondary frame, and the intercostal ribs. The production of this subassembly in a single piece requires a complex device. Furthermore, the assembly with a composite material skin requires the use of wedges because of the contraction of the skin achieved from pre-impregnated folds that lead to greatly increasing the assembly time.
