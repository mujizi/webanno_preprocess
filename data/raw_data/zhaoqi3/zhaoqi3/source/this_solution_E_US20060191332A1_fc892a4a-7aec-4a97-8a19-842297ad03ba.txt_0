[0039] After the difference in consecutive stabilized pressures is substantially smaller than the imposed/prescribed pressure drop (.DELTA.p), the "flowline expansion" cycle may be repeated one more time, shown as 850-854-855-860 in FIG. 3. If the stabilized pressures at 850 and 860 are in substantial agreement, for example within a small multiple of the gauge repeatability, the larger of the two values is taken as the first estimate of the formation pressure. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the processes as shown in FIG. 3 are for illustration only. Embodiments of the invention are not limited by how many flowline expansion cycles are performed. Furthermore, after the difference in consecutive stabilized pressures is substantially smaller than the imposed/prescribed pressure drop (.DELTA.p), it is optional to repeat the cycle one or more times.
[0040] The point at which the transition from flowline fluid expansion to flow from the formation takes place is identified as 800 in FIG. 3. If the pressures at 850 and 860 agree at the end of the allotted stabilization time, it may be advantageous in certain conditions to allow the pressure 860 to continue the build up in order to obtain a better first estimate of the formation pressure. The process by which the decision is made to either continue the investigation phase or to perform the measurement phase, 864-868-869, to obtain a final estimate of the formation pressure 870 depends on certain criterions described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/00457006. After the measurement phase is completed 870, the probe is disengaged from the wellbore wall and the pressure returns to the wellbore pressure 874 within a time period 895 and reaches stabilization at 881.
[0041] As it can be understood the unknown value is the formation pressure 870, and a precise and quick method of measurement of this value is seeking. When the difference between wellbore pressure (801, 881) and natural formation pressure 870 is typically of 1500 psi (10 MPa), the method according to U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/00457006 is applicable: for example, with a prescribed incremental pressure drop (.DELTA.p) of 300 psi (2 MPa) the investigation and measurement phases will have the same aspect as shown in FIG. 3. Nevertheless, when the difference between wellbore pressure (801, 881) and formation pressure 870 is typically of 5000 psi (34.5 MPa), as for low or very low permeability rocks, the method according to U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/00457006 with a prescribed incremental pressure drop (.DELTA.p) of 300 psi (2 MPa) will take a very long time. Also, there is a possibility to increase the prescribed incremental pressure drop (.DELTA.p) for example by using a pressure drop of 1500 psi (10 MPa), however this solution will increase the time needed for a build up phase, because the time needed for the stabilization of the pressure will also be longer if using the same criterions described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/00457006. The build up phase depending on the formation mobility, if the formation mobility is smaller as for low or very low permeability rocks, the build up time will be longer. Therefore there is a need to find a quicker method to perform investigation and measurement phases.
[0042] The method according to the present invention is based on the use of an index, which will inform on the nature and the behavior of the build up phase. Effectively, if an index could directly inform at the beginning of the build up phase what is contributing to the pressure build up: contribution of the formation flow or thermodynamic equilibrium of the flowline, the further steps of investigation phase 13b on FIG. 3 could be reduced.
[0043] As defined in FIG. 2, the formation pressure is obtained from the formation tester stabilized pressure build up value 115 after a given pretest drawdown 107. The stabilized pressure build up value is representative of the formation pressure at the condition that the pretest drawdown 107 is made lower than said stabilized pressure build up. This condition is nevertheless verified a priori, and in practice "pseudo build up" may occur when this condition is not verified (FIG. 4). Firstly, some formation testers feature a filter inside the probe; when the tool is not set a piston block the fluid path to the filter to avoid probe plugging. At the end of the tool set sequence, this piston retracts and allows access to the flowline. Thus, the flowline volume increases slightly and creates a pressure drop. The setting sequence continues for a few seconds until the final hydraulic pressure is reached. And during this few seconds the packer element of the formation tester is pressed against the formation and therefore causes the pressure in the flowline to increase. This first type of "pseudo build up" occurs only at the beginning of the pretest 41. Secondly, the pressure drop created during a drawdown cools the flowline, this cooling will be followed by a heating at the build up phase. This effect introduces a temperature gradient in the pressure sensor, affecting the measured pressure read. Furthermore, when the drawdown ends, thermodynamic equilibrium begins and the flowline tends to heat up to go back to the ambient temperature of the formation tester. This effect introduces an expansion of the flowline fluids, affecting also the measured pressure. This second type of "pseudo build up" can occur every time for a pretest drawdown 42. In FIG. 4, the time spent between 100 s and 400 s on a "pseudo build up" or non-formation build up 42 was useless.
