where m denotes the order of diffraction, and .LAMBDA. represents the grating period. It is surprising that the phase modulation .PHI..sub..DELTA. is dependent on neither the optical wavelength nor the grating depth. In addition, since the phase modulation is only dependent on the lateral displacement .DELTA., it is therefore possible to introduce a multilevel or even continuous level phase modulation using only two-level (or binary) surface relief structure.
FIG. 2b illustrates an optical waveguide device 300 comprising an optical waveguide 310 grown on an optical substrate 320. A periodic grating structure 330, which is fabricated on the surface of or into the optical waveguide 310, couples the guided optical wave 340 with an external optical wave 350. For a uniform grating coupler 330, the waveguide grating coupler theory reveals that the near field of the external optical wave 350 has a planar wavefront with an amplitude exponentially decaying along the guided wave 340 propagation direction. This indicates that such a uniform grating coupler does not have beam shaping (e.g. focusing and splitting) capability. Although a focusing grating coupler can be used to radiate a guided optical wave out of an optical waveguide and simultaneously to focus the radiated wave into a single focusing spot, it does not have the beam splitting function, i.e. it cannot produce more than one focusing sports. In order to obtain these multiple functions, i.e. beam radiating, focusing and splitting, it is therefore essential to establish a mechanism which could be used to introduce phase modulation to a radiated optical wave. This problem has not been solved so far. In order to tackle this problem, we have therefore proposed a novel method which is illustrated in FIG. 2b. In FIG. 2b., the grating coupler 330 is splitted into two sections 331 and 332, of which one section 331 is relatively displaced with the other section 332 by a distance .DELTA. in the direction perpendicular to the grating grooves 360. It is expected that both sections 331 and 332 will act independently as a grating coupler. However, we have unexpectedly discovered that the radiated optical waves (not shown), respectively radiated by 331 and 332, have a phase difference .PHI..sub..DELTA. between them described as
