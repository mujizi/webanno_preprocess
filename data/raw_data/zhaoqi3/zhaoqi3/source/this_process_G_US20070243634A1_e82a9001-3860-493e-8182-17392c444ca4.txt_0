[0064]The amplification methods of the invention make use of a sample which includes a nucleic acid template for amplification. The nucleic acid template may be of any type, e.g., genomic DNA, RNA, plasmids, bacteriophages, and/or artificial sequences. The nucleic acid template may be from any source, e.g., whole organisms, organs, tissues, cells, organelles (e.g., chloroplasts, mitochondria), synthetic nucleic acid sources, etc. Further, templates may have a wide variety of origins, e.g., pathological samples, forensic samples, archaeological samples, etc. Biological specimens may, for example, include whole blood, lymphatic fluid, serum, plasma, sweat, tear, saliva, sputum, cerebrospinal (CSF) fluids, amniotic fluid, seminal fluid, vaginal excretions, serous fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, transudates, exudates, cystic fluid, bile, urine, gastric fluids, intestinal fluids, fecal samples, and swabs or washes (e.g., oral, nasopharangeal, optic, rectal, intestinal, vaginal, epidermal, etc.) and/or other biological specimens.
[0065]Various sample processing steps may be accomplished to prepare the nucleic acid template. In some cases, such as amplification from plasmids or bacteriophages, crude sample will suffice. In other cases, such as amplification of large fragments from genomic DNA, highly purified template is preferred. Sample preparation steps may take place on or off the droplet microactuator.
[0066]The system of the invention may be configured and programmed to permit processing of a biological sample to prepare a droplet including a nucleic acid template for amplification. Some portion or all of this processing may be effected on or off the droplet microactuator, e.g., using beads having reagents bound thereto with affinity for target organisms to isolate the target organisms from a biological sample. The droplet microactuator may process the sample by dividing it into one or more discrete droplets for subsequent operations on the droplet microactuator.
[0067]Specimens may, in some instances, be treated to change reduce viscosity during subsequent droplet operations. For example, samples can be prepared on the droplet microactuator or off the droplet microactuator by mixing with an alkaline solution (for example, 10% KOH) or reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTE) or dithioerythritol (DTE) to liquefy the sample and render it sufficiently fluid to facilitate droplet operations on a droplet microactuator. Other examples of suitable sample preparation techniques are described in U.S. Patent Application No. 60/745,950, entitled "Apparatus and Methods of Sample Preparation for a Droplet Microactuator," filed on Apr. 28, 2006.
[0068]A droplet including the nucleic acid template may be combined with amplification reagents to provide an amplification-ready droplet, e.g., combined with PCR reagents to yield a PCR-ready droplet. Depending on the reagents selected, the amplification-ready droplet may be isothermally amplified or thermal cycled to effect amplification of a target nucleic acid. Amplified product may be detected and/or quantified in real-time on a droplet microactuator. In this manner, the invention provides on-chip, real-time, quantitative amplification to detect and quantify a target nucleic acid in a sample.
