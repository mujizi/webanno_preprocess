[0003] Numerous solutions have in particular been proposed in the past for lowering the rolling resistance and improving the grip of tyres, but these generally result in very significant decline of the wear resistance.
[0004] In particular, it is well known that although the incorporation of conventional white fillers such as, for example, conventional silicas or aluminas, chalk, talc, natural aluminosilicates such as bentonite or kaolin, in rubber compositions used for the manufacture of tyres and in particular of treads, does result in a reduction in the rolling resistance and an improvement in adhesion to wet, snow-covered or icy ground, it also results in an unacceptable decline in the wear resistance, linked to the fact that these conventional white fillers do not have a sufficient reinforcement ability with respect to such rubber compositions. For this reason, these white fillers are generally referred to as non-reinforcing fillers, also referred to as inert fillers.
[0005] One effective solution to this problem of insufficient wear resistance has been found due to the development, in the last ten years, of new rubber compositions comprising truly reinforcing inorganic fillers, in particular highly dispersible silicas referred to as "HDS" (for "Highly Dispersible Silica"), which have proved capable of replacing conventional carbon blacks for tyres.
[0006] The compositions based on HD silica however have the known drawback of having very substantially slower vulcanisation kinetics, as a general rule slower by a factor of two to three, compared with conventional compositions filled with carbon black. It is known that the longer curing times which result adversely affect the industrial processing of tyres or treads for tyres based on such compositions.
[0007] Now, the Applicants have discovered during their research that there are other types of reinforcing inorganic filler, in this case specific metal hydroxides, of synthetic type, which may also be used in rubber compositions as true reinforcing fillers, that is to say ones which are capable of replacing conventional carbon blacks for tyres such as HD silicas.
