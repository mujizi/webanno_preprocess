[0011] The A&R winch wire 13 is rigged on the ramp, and possibly fitted with a high capacity swivel 14, and then connected to the A&R head 12 on the pipe 10, as illustrated in FIG. 2d.
[0012] The A&R winch wire 13 is pre-tensioned no take the pipe load and the HOC 9 is released {opened). The pipe 10 is then free to untwist itself by rotating the A&R wire 13/swivel 14 as indicated by arrow A in FIG. 2e, which particularly shows the HOC 9 in the released position, as opposed to the gripping position illustrated in FIGS. 2a to 2d.
[0013] Once the pipe has untwisted, the HOC 9 is activated to grip the pipe 10 again, as illustrated in FIG. 2f, The winch wire and the swivel are removed, and the A&R connection head 12 also removed, all as indicated by the dashed lines in FIG. 2g. After this processing the situation illustrated in FIG. 2h is achieved, and subsequent tasks such as pipe joining and the installation of mid/end line modules etc. can be executed.
[0014] The overall process described above with reference to FIGS. 2a to 2h is very time-consuming and can take of the order of 12 hours, and may have to be done several times in a pipelay project. This adds considerably to the cost for the use of the pipelay vessel 2 on a given contract.
[0015] It should be noted that: it is crucial that the welding of the A&R head 12 to the pipe end is carefully executed and tested, as failure of the welding can lead to a catastrophic loss of the pipe string below the HOC 9. Since there is no means of applying a physical load to the weld, testing in this case is limited to only non-destructive testing (NDT).
