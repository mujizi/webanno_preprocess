The resulting pulp 74 will be noticeably brighter than the starting pulp. For example, southern softwood, after the pulping process, has a GE brightness of about 15% to 25%; after the oxygen bleaching process, a GE brightness of about 25% to 45%; and after the ozone bleaching process, a GE brightness of about 50% to 70%.
4. Alkaline Extraction
The washed pulp 88 from the ozone stage is then combined with a sufficient amount of alkaline material 90 in extraction vessel 92 to effect extraction. Thus, pulp 88 is subjected to an aqueous alkaline solution for a predetermined time and at a predetermined temperature correlated to the quantity of alkaline material to solubilize a substantial portion of any lignin which remains in the pulp, in vessel 92. This extraction-process also increases the brightness of the pulp, typically by about 2 GE brightness points. Thereafter, the alkali treated pulp 94 is directed to washing unit 96, the aqueous alkaline solution is washed from the pulp so as to remove substantially all of the solubilized lignin from the pulp, thus forming a substantially lignin-free pulp. This step is well known to those skilled in the art and no further comment is deemed necessary here. The examples illustrate the preferred extraction parameters for this step of the process. At least a portion of the alkaline solution 98 which is recovered is recycled to washing unit 84. Again, major environmental benefits are achieved from the elimination of sewering of this solution.
In some cases, particularly where higher final brightnesses are targeted, the extraction step can be augmented by incorporating an oxygen treatment within the caustic extraction step (E.sub.o). This alternative, also well known to those skilled in the art, requires no further comment here.
