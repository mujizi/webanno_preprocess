As a result, it was found out that most of the HA molecules remained undigested when treated with each of these proteases in the absence of urea. The HA molecules, which had been denatured with urea, employed as a substrate were not digested with v8 protease, thermolysin and pronase. When lysyl endopeptidase, chymotrypsin and subtilisin were used, the digestion proceeded excessively and the antigenicity for C179 completely disappeared. When proteinase K was used, on the other hand, it was confirmed that the HA molecules were digested and polypeptide fragments having an avidity for C179 were formed.
(3) Preparation of Stem Region Polypeptide
To the HA molecules (250 .mu.g/1400 .mu.l) prepared in Example 8-(1) were successively added 100 .mu.l of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 500 .mu.l of 8 M urea and the resulting mixture was maintained at 42.degree. C. for 1 hour. To this solution was added 2000 .mu.l of an immobilized Proteinase K gel and maintained at 37.degree. C. for 7 hours under shaking. After centrifuging, the reaction mixture thus obtained was dialyzed against PBS for 12 hours and thus the stem region polypeptide was obtained. The immobilized Proteinase K gel was prepared in the following manner. 4 mg of Proteinase K (manufactured by Boehringer) was dissolved in 1 ml of H.sub.2 O and the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 5.0 with 0.1 N HCl. After adding 1 ml of ECH-Sepharose (manufactured by Pharmacia) and 1 ml of 0.2 M EDC (pH 5.0) thereto, the mixture was maintained at 4.degree. C. for 24 hours. This gel was washed with 10 ml portions of PBS thrice to thereby give the immobilized Proteinase K gel.
(4) Properties of Stem Region Polypeptide
By using the stem region polypeptide of Example 8-(3) as a test sample, the antigenicity for C179 was examined by the ELISA method. Namely, a diluted solution of the stem region polypeptide was added to a microtiter plate (Maxi Sorp; manufactured by Nunc) and immobilized at 37.degree. C. for 90 minutes. Then blocking was effected by using Block Ace (manufactured by Snow Brand Milk Products). Then these cells were continuously reacted with 2 antibodies [10 mg/ml C179 solution diluted 200-fold, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G solution (manufactured by Cappel) diluted 500-fold] each for 90 minutes and the cells thus treated were washed with PBS. Finally, the peroxidase reaction was effected by using 0.03% H.sub.2 O2 and 1 mg/ml of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in citric acid/phosphoric acid (pH 5.2). The amount of the antigen was calculated from the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 492 nm. As a standard, HA molecules described in Example 8-(1) were used. As the result of the ELISA method, it has been proved that this stem region polypeptide has an antigenicity comparable to that of HA molecules. The hemagglutination activity (HA value) of the stem region polypeptide was determined in the following manner. On a U-shaped 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon 3911: manufactured by Becton Dickinson Labware), the sample solution was diluted with PBS in two steps. Then the same amount of a 0.5% avian erythrocyte suspension was added thereto and the mixture was stirred well. After reacting at room temperature for 1 hour, agglutination of the erythrocytes was observed. The highest dilution ratio showing agglutination was taken as the HA value.
