Recycle asphalt pavement or other suitable recycle material may be introduced into the combined mixing/heating zone 40 through a recycle feed hopper 58 (direction arrow 59). The recycle material and the aggregate are heated and mixed in the combined mixing/heating zone 40.
Eventually, the combined recycle material and aggregate mixture reaches into the mixing zone 24, where liquid asphalt is added to the mixture to produce hot mix asphalt product. As indicated by direction arrow 60, the asphalt product is discharged from the mixing zone 24 of the drum mixer 10.
One problem with the drum mixer 10 was excessive heat in the combustion chamber 28. Even with the addition of heat transfer fins (such as the ones designated by reference numeral 62) to the exterior wall of the combustion housing 26, the heat in the combustion chamber 28 was too great. In order to correct this problem, the diameter and volume of the combustion chamber had to be increased.
With reference now to FIG. 2, shown therein and designated by reference number 70 is a drum mixer constructed in accordance with the present invention and having a high volume combustion chamber. The drum mixer 70 comprises a rotatable drum 72 having a first drum shell 74 and a second drum shell 76.
The drum shells 74 and 76 are connected so that the drum 72 rotates as a unit. The drum 72 is supported for rotation on supports (not shown) by a pair of roller rings 78. A chain and sprocket assembly (not shown) or the like is provided to rotate the drum 72.
