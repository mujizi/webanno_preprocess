[0287]Regarding to the first difference, the terminal 101c uses Direct Transfer (Initial Direct Transfer, Uplink Direct Transfer, and Downlink Direct Transfer in 3GPP TS 25.331), which transfers signals to a core network through RRC since the terminal 101c does not have the address of the packet controller 106. When a signal directed to the packet controller 106 is input from the terminal 101c using Direct Transfer, the radio network controller 104 determines whether the signal is Direct Transfer, and transfers the signal from the terminal 101c to the packet controller 106 by using RANAP (RAN Application Part, which is a protocol between a core network and RNC in 3GPP defined in 3GPP TS 25.413). On the other hand, the packet controller 106 uses RANAP for transferring a signal directed to the terminal 101c. The relay function of the radio network controller 104 is represented by separations of arrows indicating the position registration request 2301 and response in FIG. 23. Packets to be sent from the terminal 101c to the radio network controller 104 are relayed by the second WLAN access network 103b and the second WLAN gateway 105b. While the relay points are represented by solid circles in FIG. 22, such indications are omitted from FIG. 23 and FIG. 24 described later.
[0288]It should be noted that instead of using Direct Transfer for relaying signals between the terminal 101c and the packet controller 106, items of information such as a header or tailer indicating the signal is a control signal relating to GPRS may be contained in each message and the radio network controller 104 may relay signals judged to be signals relating to the packet controller 106 such as GPRS by means of the items of information. Since this method also enables communication between the terminal 101c and the packet controller 106, advantageous effects of the third embodiment can be achieved.
[0289]Communication between the packet controller 106 and the terminal 101c can also be enabled by providing the address of the packet controller 106 to the terminal 101c without explicitly relaying by the radio network controller 104. Advantageous effects of the third embodiment can be achieved by this method as well. Excluding the differences described above, the process shown in FIG. 23 is the same as the ATTACH process in TS 23.060.
[0290]A sequence for registering the position of the terminal 101c will be described below. First, terminal 101c sends a position registration request 2301 to the packet controller 106 to request the packet controller 106 to register its position. This corresponds to Attach Request in TS 23.060. When the packet controller 106 receives the position registration request 2301, the following four processes are performed between the terminal 101c and the packet controller 106. First, (1) if the terminal 101c is out of the area controlled by the packet controller 106, an ID request/response process 2302 is performed in which the packet controller 106 requests the terminal 101c to send an ID such as IMSI of the terminal 101c and the terminal 101c responds to the request. This corresponds to Identification Request and Identification Response in TS 23.060. Then, (2) a 3GPP authentication process 2303 is performed in which the packet controller 106 authenticates the terminal 101c. This corresponds to Authentication and Ciphering Request, and Authentication and Ciphering Response in TS 23.060 transferred between SGSN and UE. Send Authentication Info and Send Authentication Info Ack signals are transmitted between SGSN and HLR. Then, (3) an IMEI confirmation process 2304 for authenticating the terminal 101c is performed. This sequence is not essential and can be omitted. This corresponds to Identity Request and Identity Response in TS 23.060. Then, (4) a position update process is performed for inputting positional information in a user information storing section 111. The position update process is performed by communicating a position update request 2305, a subscriber data insert 2306, and a position update response 2307 between the packet controller 106 and the user information storing section 111. The position update request 2305, subscriber data insert 2306, and position update response 2307 correspond to Update Location, Insert Subscriber Data, Insert Subscriber Data Ack, and Update Location Ack in TS 23.060. After completion of these processes, the packet controller 106 sends a position registration response 2309 to the terminal 101c to indicate the completion of the ATTACH.
[0291]Returning to FIG. 15, after the position registration process (S1507), the terminal 101c performs a process for activating PDP information (S1508). FIG. 24 shows a process for initializing PDP information (PDP (Packet Data Protocol which is IP in this embodiment) context in TS 23.060) about the terminal 101c in the packet controller 106.
