[0022] In a preferred embodiment such an autonomous robot, included in a system with a plurality of operation modules, is used almost continuously and thereby profitably in environments where individual task-dedicated autonomous robots, such as a floor polishing robots would not be profitable.
[0023] In a preferred embodiment, the operation module is provided with its own wheels. In this way they are storable and movable independently of the autonomous mobile robot and support their own loads. In another preferred embodiment, they are also be provided with their own power means, for lifting etc. They also have means for electrical connection as well as means for signaling and interaction with the autonomous mobile robot. In this way, a docked operation module is capable of powering the autonomous robot.
[0024] An autonomous mobile robot normally has at least three wheels to be able to stand stable in an upright position. In a preferred embodiment, two of these wheels are used for driving and the third wheel is used for steering. In another preferred embodiment, the two wheels are moved separately and the third wheel is freely moveable in all direction in a horizontal plane. By rotating the two driving wheels at different speeds or in a remote direction, the robot is steered by those driving wheels. In this case the third wheel must be freely swivelable around a vertical axis. In another embodiment, the third wheel has both a driving and a steering function. In this case the two other wheels are used as tracking and stabilizing wheels. If more wheels are used, it would only result, especially when to ground is not flat, in one of the wheels being out of contact with the ground. If this wheel happens to be one of the driving wheels, the robot can not move correctly. This, of course, can be avoided by having suspended wheels. In another way this problem is avoided by having a horizontal axis functionality between the two pairs of wheels.
[0025] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the robot comprises a cylinder shaped central body carried and is driven on two wheels or just one wheel. In this embodiment, the robot comprises a frame carrying the mechanical interface on a pair of wheels. The frame acts as a wagon to the central body and is attached to the central body by a coupling that allows the frame to swing around an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis through the central body.
[0026] According to the invention, the operation module has no wheels at all or any number of wheels. Most common would be two, three or four wheels. In any of these cases, the combined unit comprising an autonomous mobile robot and an operation module would have more than five wheels. According to the discussion above, this would result in an undefined contact with the ground. If one or more wheels are lifted or suspended on docking, this problem is solved. Then the combined unit would only have three wheels in firm contact with the ground. In one embodiment, the robot and the module are coupled with a coupling that allows rotation around an axis normal to a vertical connection plane between the robot and the module. In this way, four wheels are always in firm contact with the ground.
