[0002] The invention relates to a process for adjusting the pH of a cellulosic pulp in a pulp and/or paper mill, and to the production of pulp, paper or board from so treated cellulosic pulp. The invention also relates to the use of (bi)carbonate removal for reducing the consumption of acid in the treatment of a cellulosic pulp. Carbon dioxide is used in the invention to adjust the pH of the pulp.
[0003] Cellulosic pulp is produced in a pulp mill by chemical or mechanical treatment of wood chips. Cellulosic pulp may also be provided by repulping of recycled fibers.
[0004] Although there are a number of different processes available, the most frequently used process for producing chemical pulp is the so called Kraft process. In this process, wood chips are cooked in the presence of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. A highly alkaline mixture of digested pulp and cooking liquor (black liquor) is obtained. The black liquor is removed and the pulp is typically washed, optionally delignified with oxygen, washed, filtered and washed again.
[0005] Digested and optionally oxygen delignified pulp is still fairly dark in color and for producing bright grades of products it needs to be bleached. In the bleaching plant, the pulp is typically bleached with acidic and or alkaline bleaching agents and extracted and washed between treatments. Bleaching chemicals include chlorine, hypo chlorite, chlorine dioxide, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, enzymes, dithionite, etc. As the pH changes from alkaline to acidic and back to alkaline or neutral, huge amounts of acids and bases are consumed.
[0006] Washing is an important operation in removing from the fibers chemicals and components which have been detached from the fibers in the previous digestion, bleaching and/or extraction operation. Various ways for improving the washing of the fibers in the pulp mill have been created. One such prior art washing process, which has been much used in the art is described in EP-B1-0 296 198 (AGA). The document relates to improved washing of an alkaline pulp. The washing-out of COD contributing substances is improved when the pH is reduced by gaseous carbon dioxide added to the pulp and/or to the water used for washing the pulp. A description of mill trials using the carbon dioxide washing technique of EP 0 296 198 was made by G. Ostberg in a presentation called "Use of Carbon Dioxide in the Production of Sulphate Pulp" at the 5.sup.th international conf. on new available techniques, Stockholm, 4-7 Jun. 1996.
