[0077] In a preferred implementation, the first primer(s) is(are) immobilized onto the solid surface. In a more preferred implementation, the method provided by the present inventors may also include a step of denaturing the target nucleic acid(s) prior to polymerization, and preferably the PCR step is conducted with a PCR enzyme that is thermo-stable.
[0078] In another preferred implementation, the signal(s) change may comprise a change of current intensity, which in all likelihood will be proportional to the concentration of the polynucleic acid(s) produced and of nucleic acid(s) in the sample.
[0079] This method may be employed by running more than one PCR amplification cycle. Clearly, in this mode of the method each signal change is associated with or proportional to the amount of polynucleic acid(s) formed in each PCR amplification cycle. In yet another preferred implementation, the electric signal may be detected and/or its value measured with at least a pair of conductive electrodes placed in the sample. Multiple pairs of electrodes may also be employed as described herein.
[0080] In one preferred implementation, the surface of at least one of the conductive electrode(s) comprises indium tin oxide, gold, platinum, or carbon.
[0081] In an even more preferred implementation, probes may be bound onto the conductive electrode surface. In this type of method, the labels may comprise ferrocene and ferrocene derivatives, as well as others that an artisan would recognize.
