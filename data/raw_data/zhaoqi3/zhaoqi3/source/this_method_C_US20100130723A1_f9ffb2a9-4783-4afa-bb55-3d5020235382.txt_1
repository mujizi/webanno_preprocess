[0038] A number of techniques for synthesizing polypeptide or peptide-linked molecules in vitro have been described. For example, stepwise blocking/de-blocking methods have been known in the art for many years as a way of building polypeptide molecules. However, these methods generally require multiple chemical steps for the addition of each amino acid to the polymer resulting in a time-consuming process with a low product yield.
[0039] An alternative, solution-based approach to synthesizing a peptide molecule may be achieved using a carbodiimide method. This approach generally relies on the use of a carbodiimide molecule (e.g., dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), etc.) to activate a carboxyl (e.g., --COOH) group of one compound, such as an amino acid, to produce a highly reactive intermediate which may then react and bond to other compounds or molecules, such as through an amino group of an amino acid to form a peptide bond. This method may be used to link two amino acids together or to couple an amino acid (or preformed peptide) to an active agent. However, this carbodiimide reaction scheme is not capable of self-polymerization and merely provides a coupling or linking mechanism for joining two molecules. Once a carbodiimide-activated molecule, such as a carbodiimide-activated amino acid, is allowed to react with another compound, the reaction is complete. To synthesize a polypeptide containing, for example, three or more amino acids using the carbodiimide method, a stepwise approach would be necessary to carry out repeated rounds of activation and coupling. Such a step-wise approach is a time-consuming process having a substantial reduction in yield to carry out these multiple reaction steps. Furthermore, any additional side groups which might react with a carbodiimide-activated intermediate may need to be blocked to avoid formation of unintended and undesired by-products. In addition, carbodiimides tend to form racemic mixtures of amino acids which may be incorporated into peptide-linked molecules or polymers. Considering that most naturally occurring amino acids are L-amino acids, racemization may make enzyme digestion of carbodiimide-produced polypeptides difficult or impossible, and a large proportion of active agents incorporated into carbodiimide-produced polypeptides or amino acid conjugates may be rendered inaccessible or biologically inactive. Although the addition of triazolol compounds (e.g., hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), etc.) have reduced this racemic effect, carbodiimide-based methods remain a less practical approach for synthesizing polypeptide molecules.
[0040] One effective method for synthesizing polypeptides or peptide-linked polymers that overcomes issues of racemization and non-spontaneous polymerization is the Fuchs-Farthing approach of generating highly reactive N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) intermediates of compounds or amino acids. Unlike the carbodiimide approach discussed above, this NCA-based method preserves the stereoisomeric state of compounds or amino acids incorporated into a growing polypeptide or polymer chain, i.e., such NCA-based methods are stereospecific. Thus, products formed by this method will have normal peptide bonds which may be recognized and hydrolyzed by, for example, proteases, as well as other natural enzymes.
[0041] In general, NCA-based methods for synthesizing polymers, such as polypeptides, peptide-linked compounds, etc., may involve two basic reactions: (1) formation of one or more NCA-containing monomer(s) from one or more types of monomer(s), and (2) polymerization of these monomer(s) to form a desired polymer product(s) upon introduction of at least one type of initiator. In the first reaction, NCA-containing monomer(s), which may include NCA-compounds and NCA-amino acids, may be formed by reacting one or more monomer(s) with a phosgene compound in an aprotic solvent to form a temporary N-chlorocarbonyl intermediate, which then cyclizes to form an NCA moiety of the NCA-containing monomer(s) with release of two HCl molecules (See, e.g., Example 1).
[0042] NCA-containing monomer(s) synthesized during the first reaction step may then be used in an NCA-based polymerization reaction to form a polymer, such as a polypeptide, peptide-linked compound, etc., which is initiated by the introduction of an initiator. Because both the amino group and carboxyl group on the .alpha.-carbon of a monomer form part of the cyclized ring structure of the NCA moiety of an NCA-containing monomer, the .alpha.-amino group of an NCA-containing monomer is not available to function as an initiating group until the NCA ring structure (i.e., NCA moiety) of the NCA-containing monomer is opened to reform the .alpha.-amino group of its base monomer. Therefore, the NCA-based polymerization reaction may not begin until an initiator is introduced to open the NCA-ring structure (or NCA moiety) by forming a peptide bond between the .alpha.-carbonyl group of the NCA-containing monomer and the initiating group of an initiator, with the release of carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2) as a by-product. As a result of opening the ring structure of the NCA moiety of an NCA-containing monomer during an NCA-based polymerization reaction, the .alpha.-amino group of the base monomer of the NCA-containing monomer is reformed and able to function as an "initiating group" for another NCA-containing monomer (i.e., for the next round of polymerization). Through this iterative process within a reaction mixture, the NCA-based polymerization reaction may occur spontaneously, and a polymer, such as a polypeptide, peptide-linked compound, etc., may be formed. Such NCA-based polymerization reaction may occur through either protic or aprotic mechanisms.
