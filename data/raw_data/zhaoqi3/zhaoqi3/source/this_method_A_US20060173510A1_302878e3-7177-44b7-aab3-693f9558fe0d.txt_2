[0017] In another example, multiple spatial filters are used for the localization of electrical sources from EEG signals in the brain (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,263,488). This technique requires post processing and is limited in resolution due to the use of conventional EEG electrodes.
[0018] In another example involving the localization of electrical sources in the brain using EEG, (MRI another method of imaging the head is used for determining the shape and thickness of the scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,331,970). Once this information is acquired, then a computer model is developed and a mathematical deblurring algorithm is applied to estimate the location of the sources on the cortical surface of the brain. This requires much post processing time to determine where the sources originate from and cannot be used in real-time.
[0019] A similar approach has been utilized for imaging electrical activity of the heart (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,856,830). This method involves the recording of ECG on the body surface, obtaining an MRI or CT image of the patient's torso, and entering both components into a heart-torso model. The ext step of this method involves post processing, whereby, the body surface potentials are calculated for sources in the heart and compared to the measured body surface potentials. This procedure must be repeated iteratively until the two components are within a given preset error range. Hence, this process cannot be performed in real-time. Further, there is no definite localization of the sources, and, distortion, due to global sources, is evident because the recording is performed with ordinary ECG electrodes.
[0020] In another example, regular EEG recording techniques and/or MEG are used, and restrictions are placed on the location where the brain electrical activity may be occurring (see e.g., U.S. patent application 20030093004). This approach is limited by the fact that the location of the activity must be known prior to the performance of this technique in order for this type of a system to resolve an inverse localization from the surface potentials. Further, this technique suffers from the blurring effects of the heads volume conductor.
[0021] In another example, electrical impedance plethysmography (EIP) is suggested for localizing electrical sources inside biological tissue (see e.g., U.S. patent application 20020038095). In EIP, impedance characterizations that are made over a period of time are used to localize changes in the body tissue. Electrical stimulation is injected into tissue and return signals are measured to determine the impedance. As sources below the surface interact with the injected signals, a map of conductivities is developed, and a model is assembled from these conductivities to iteratively localize sources in the tissue. This type of device is still dependent on typical EEG electrodes, which accept global signals distorting the localization process.
