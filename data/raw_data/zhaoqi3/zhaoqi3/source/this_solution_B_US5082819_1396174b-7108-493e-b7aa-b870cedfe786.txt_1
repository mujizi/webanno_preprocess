In the following Examples 5, 6 and 7, the various catalyst compositions are made in geometrical shape III in FIG. 1 as in Example 2.
EXAMPLE 5
The coprecipitate for making the active catalyst phase is obtained by dissolving 242.4 g Fe(NO.sub.3).sub.3.9H.sub.2 O, 232.8 g Co(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O, 1744.8 g Ni(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O and 5.1 g KNO.sub.3 in 3.1 liters of water; and while stirring, at 90.degree. C., one first of all adds a solution of 34.9 g Sm.sub.2 O.sub.3 in 212 g of concentration HNO.sub.3. To this solution one adds, while stirring, 300.5 g of highly dispersed silicic acid (Aerosil 200) and 300.5 g tempered montmorillonite (specific surfaces according to BET <1 m.sup.2 /g). In a separate vessel, at 60.degree. C., one prepares a solution of 2118.6 g (NH.sub.4).sub.6 Mo.sub.7 O.sub.24.6H.sub.2 O in 2.7 liters H.sub.2 O and to it, while stirring intensively, one adds 115.3 g of 85% H.sub.3 PO.sub.4. Thereafter, both solutions are combined amid intensive stirring and a solution of 485.1 g Bi(NO.sub.3).sub.3.5H.sub.2 O in 408 g 8.2% HNO.sub.3 is added. The suspension thus obtained is dried in a spray drier at a drying air entry temperature of 550.degree. C. The ratio between drying air volume and sprayed suspension quantity is adjusted here so that one gets an exit temperature of 170.degree. C. and the suspension quantity is adjusted so that one gets a time of 6 seconds spent by the sprayed dried powder in the spray drier. The atomization intensity is selected so that one gets a sprayed particle with an average diameter dp=25 .mu.m. The dried spray dried powder is calcined for 30 minutes in a rotary cylindrical kiln at a maximum temperature of the spray dried powder of 420.degree. C.
The further processing of the calcined spray dried powder takes place as in Example 2, except that the extruded hollowed strand has an inside diameter of 2 mm.
