[0118] With these openings 34 closed off, the stimulation fluid 104 will then flow into the lateral wellbores 74a, b from which sufficient fractures 106 have not yet been formed. As described above, the openings 34 can be shaped or configured to more readily sealingly receive the plugging devices 108.
[0119] Thus, upon completion of the lateral wellbores 74a, b construction process, the geometry of the machined hole openings 34 in the casing sections 36 will allow for sequential fracture stimulation treatments using degradable, spherically-shaped ball sealers or other plugging devices 108 which are sized slightly larger than the diameter of the hole openings in the casing sections. In this sequential fracture stimulation process, the plugging devices 108 are released into the stimulation fluids 104 from a location above the targeted lateral wellbores 74a, b (i.e., from the surface) in stages to intentionally divert stimulation fluids which are being predominately injected into a particular lateral wellbore into one or more additional lateral wellbores.
[0120] For example, if eight lateral wellbores 74 extending from a parent wellbore 44 are to be stimulated using this process, approximately seven plugging devices 108 would be used to divide each of eight fracture stimulation stages. This sequential fracture stimulation process is intended to ensure each lateral wellbore 74 is effectively stimulated and to promote the alteration of the effective in-situ stress state in the targeted zones 102 in near real-time, thus promoting the creation of highly productive complex induced fracture systems.
[0121] Referring additionally now to FIG. 14, another configuration of the system 100 is representatively illustrated. This configuration is similar to that of FIG. 13, except that instead of the plugging devices 108, flow diversion sleeves 110 are positioned in the parent wellbore 44 and used to selectively permit and prevent fluid communication with each of the lateral wellbores 74a, b.
[0122] The diversion sleeves 110 could, for example, be the same as or similar to the valve device 66 depicted in FIG. 5. The lateral wellbores 74a, b could have been drilled through the openings 34 in the valve device 66 as depicted in FIG. 4. Furthermore, use of the valve device 66 of FIG. 5 would permit any order or combination of the lateral wellbores 74a, b to be simultaneously and/or sequentially stimulated.
