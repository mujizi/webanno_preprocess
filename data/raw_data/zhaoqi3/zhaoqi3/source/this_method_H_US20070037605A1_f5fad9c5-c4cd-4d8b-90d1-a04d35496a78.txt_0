[0042] As described in the above-noted paper by Weissman, four known methods are commonly used to provide indoor object location: Proximity Detection (PD), Received Signal Strength (RSSI), Time of arrival (TOA), and Angle of Arrival (AOA). Each of these methods may be used to determine the relative or absolute location of a portable phone in order to implement functions contemplated by the present invention:
[0043] Proximity Detection (PD)
[0044] This method relies upon a dense grid of antennas, each having a well-known position. When a mobile device is somehow detected by a single antenna, it is considered to be collocated with it. When more than one antenna detects the mobile device, it is considered to be collocated with the one that receives the strongest signal. This method is relatively simple to implement using infrared and radio signaling.
[0045] Triangulation
[0046] Triangulation takes proximity detection a step further, in the sense that it is based on measuring the signal level measurements from each antenna (possibly by using a triangulation mechanism), with respect to each mobile device. Following that, mobile is located by using a triangulation algorithm. This can be quite accurate outdoors. Indoor, however, it is susceptible to structure-related problems, such as multipath and non-uniform attenuation. Like the PD method, triangulation is relatively simple to implement, though there are some algorithmic intricacies that need to be solved to make the system accurate.
