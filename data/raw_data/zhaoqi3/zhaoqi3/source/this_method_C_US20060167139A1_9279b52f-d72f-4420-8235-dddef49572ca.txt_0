[0025] Characterization of these materials allows informed tailoring of the nanofilled polymer materials. These include FT infra-red absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, X-ray analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, Raman spectroscopy, thermally-stimulated currents, dielectric spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Engineering these materials is aided by establishing the correct conditions at the interfacial zones.
[0026] "Nanoparticle" is defined as a particulate material having an average particle or grain size between 1 and 100 nanometers. Nanoparticles are distinguishable from particles having a particle size in the micron range, that is, greater than about 1 .mu.m. Nanoparticles of any size, that is, ranging from about 1 nm to less than about 100 nm, may be used in the nanocomposites. In certain embodiments, particle size may range from about 2 nm to about 80 nm, optionally from about 5 nm to about 50 nm, and in other embodiments, from about 5 to about 30 nm.
[0027] Particle size distribution of the nanoparticles is typically narrow. A narrow particle size distribution is defined as one in which greater than about 90% of the particles have a particle size in the range of about 0.2 to about 2 times the mean particle size. In certain embodiments, greater than 95% of the particles have a particle size in this range, optionally greater than 99%. Another way to define a particle size distribution is in terms of the mean particle size and the width of the distribution; this method is used in the nanoparticle industry. The relationship between the width of the distribution curve at one half of the maximum value (full width-half max or FWHM) and mean particle size is used as a measure of broadness or narrowness of the distribution. For example, a distribution having a FWHM value that is greater than the mean particle size is considered relatively broad. Specifically, a narrow particle size distribution is defined in terms of FWHM as a distribution in which the FWHM of the distribution curve is equal to the difference between the mean particle size plus 40% of the mean and the mean minus 40% of the mean. (This may be simplified to two times 40% of the mean, or 80% of the mean. Using this simplified formula, the FWHM is less than or equal to 80% of the mean.) In certain embodiments the FWHM is less than or equal to the difference between the mean plus 30% and the mean minus 30% (60% of the mean.). In other embodiments, the FWHM is less than or equal to the difference between the mean plus 20% and the mean minus 20% (40% of the mean).
[0028] Nanoparticles useful in the nanocomposites may be equiaxed, such that their shape is quasi-spherical. The long axis of a particle is defined as the longest axis through a particle, and the short axis means the shortest axis through a particle. In certain embodiments, the long axis of the nanoparticles for use in the nanocomposites adapted for electrical insulation is approximately equal to the short axis, resulting in a particle shape that is quasi-spherical. In these embodiments, for at least about 90% of the nanoparticles, the ratio of the length of the short axis to that of the long axis is at least about 0.1, optionally about 0.4, and further optionally about 0.8.
[0029] Non-spherical nanoparticles may also be used in the nanocomposites adapted for electrical insulation. In this case, particle size is defined as the size of the smallest dimension of the particle. For example, nanotubes having an average particle diameter of about 1 to less than 100 nm may be used, and particle size of such particles is the particle diameter, about 1 to less than 100 nm. Other non-spherical nanoparticles that may be used in nanocomposites adapted for electrical insulation include carbon or ceramic nano-fiber whiskers.
