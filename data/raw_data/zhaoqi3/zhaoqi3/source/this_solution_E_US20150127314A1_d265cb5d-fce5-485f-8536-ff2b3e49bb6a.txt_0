[0020] For both of the producer well embodiments of FIGS. 1A and 1B, control panel 132 includes a remote terminal unit (RTU) which collects the data from the downhole measurement devices and forwards it to a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system that is part of a processing system such as processing system 45 of FIG. 2. In the illustrative embodiment shown, processing system 45 includes a blade server-based computer system 54 that includes several processor blades, at least some of which provide the above-described SCADA functionality. Other processor blades may be used to implement the disclosed simulation systems and methods. Processing system 45 also includes user workstation 51, which includes a general purpose processor 46. Both the processor blades of blade server 54 and general purpose processor 46 are preferably configured by software, shown in FIG. 2 in the form of removable, non-transitory (i.e., non-volatile) information storage media 52, to process collected well data within the reservoirs and data from a gathering network (described below) that couples to each well and transfers product extracted from the reservoirs. The software may also include downloadable software accessed through a communication network (e.g., via the Internet). General purpose processor 46 couples to a display device 48 and a user-input device 50 to enable a human operator to interact with the system software 52. Alternatively, display device 48 and user-input device 50 may couple to a processing blade within blade server 54 that operates as general purpose processor 46 of user workstation 51.
[0021] As noted above, the wells of each reservoir are coupled together by a gathering network. FIG. 3 shows an illustrative example of a group of N reservoirs 302-1 through 302-N coupled together through a gathering network 320. Individual well lines 304 (1 through N) from each well couple to a reservoir node 306 (1 through N), with each node coupling through a reservoir line 305 (1 through N) to a common node 308. Common node 308 provides mixed product from all the reservoirs through riser 309 to processing facility 300. In the example shown, processing facility 300 includes a separator 310 that receives the mixed product from facility riser 309 and separates the product into water, oil and gas. These separated products are respectively stored in water storage 312, oil storage 316 and gas storage 314 for later use and/or delivery further downstream (e.g., to a refining facility). Alternatively, some of the separated product may be used to assist with the removal of product from the reservoir. For example, some of the separated gas and/or water may be re-injected into one or more reservoirs as part of an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operation, as shown by the dashed arrows in FIG. 3.
[0022] The maximization of the production of hydrocarbons from multiple reservoirs feeding a common gathering network involves controlling the production of each individual well such that the combined production of the wells, or a selected group of the wells, provides the greatest amount of oil and/or gas possible without exceeding any of the processing facility's limits. In at least some illustrative embodiments, the well operating points that enable the operation of the processing facility within its limits are determined using a combination of production well measurements, reservoir characterizations and well, reservoir and facility constraints that are all provided as inputs to a simulator. The simulator uses this data to identify optimal well operating points, expressed as a solution to a simultaneous set of equations. In most cases this solution will not be an exact solution, but instead a solution that provides the greatest oil and/or gas production while most closely approaching the facility constraints, but without exceeding any constraints.
[0023] FIG. 4 shows the data flow for an illustrative simulation 400 that combines available well, reservoir and facility data and constraints (i.e., production system data and constraints) to derive the desired production system operating points for a given simulation timestep. A fluid model 406 for each reservoir accepts as inputs production system measurements 402 (both surface and downhole well measurements), simulated reservoir measurements 404 from prior timesteps, and fluid characterization data 408. Production system measurements 402 may include, but are not limited to pressure, temperature and fluid flow measurements taken downhole near the well perforations, along the production string, at the wellhead and within the gathering network prior to the point where the fluids mix with fluids from other reservoirs. Previous timestep data 404 similarly may represent, without being limited to, updated temperature, pressure and flow data, or other estimates output from fully-coupled equations 414. Fluid characterization data 408 may include the reservoirs' fluid components (e.g., heavy crude, light crude, methane, etc.) and their proportions, fluid density and viscosity for various compositions, pressures and temperatures, or other data.
[0024] Based on the above-described data input to the fluid model 406, parameters are determined for each fluid component or group of components of the reservoir. The resulting model for each component/group is then applied to known state variables to calculate unknown state variables at each simulation point or "gridblock" within the reservoir, at the wellbore perforations or "sandface," and within the gathering network. These unknown variables may include a gridblock's liquid volume fraction, solution gas-oil ratio and formation volume factor, just to name a few examples. The resulting fluid component state variables, both measured and calculated, are provided as inputs to fully-coupled equations 414. As shown, the fully-coupled equations 414 also receive floating parameters 412, fixed parameters 418 and reservoir characterization data 416 as inputs. Examples of floating parameters 412 include EOR parameters such as gas lift injection rates, reservoir gas injection rates and reservoir liquid injection rates. Examples of fixed parameters 418 include facility constraints (e.g., a production capacity limit) and default production rates for individual wells. Reservoir characterization data 416 may include geological data describing reservoir formations (e.g., log data previously collected during drilling and/or prior logging of the well) and formation characteristics (e.g., porosity).
