[0018] In an embodiment of the invention, the control elements are a graphical representation for a parameter input. This can ensue in the form of textual inputs, inputs by means of keyboard and/or mouse or other accessories. The parameter inputs advantageously serve for controlling an application process (post-processing, adjustments in an angiography, control of a magnetic resonance tomography apparatus, etc.). The control elements are typically activated by a corresponding using input of a user. It is alternatively possible to activate the control elements by reading data out from other modules via an interface and for control using a decision action.
[0019] A difference from the prior art is that only the control elements and/or the control groups that are relevant for the respective application are presented on the user interface. The user thus is not confronted with control elements that are without importance for the application to be currently implemented.
[0020] In a further embodiment of the invention a reference is associated with a user interface generated for at least one application, by means of which reference the user interface can be retrieved and/or can be executed at a later point in time, in particular upon execution of the application. The association normally ensues via a name and is unambiguous. In other words, a generated user interface can be unambiguously selected or, respectively, determined via a name associated with it. This procedure is also designated as an ASSIGN procedure. All generated user interfaces and the respective names associated with them are typically stored in a corresponding data structure. The user thus can obtain an overview of which user interfaces can be selected in principle. Moreover, it is possible that a specific generated user interface is selected for an application is selected from a set of user interfaces. Here the user can also select from pre-configurable names. As soon as the user has selected a user interface for use, this is activated and presented on the screen. This procedure is also designated as a USE procedure. A high flexibility can be achieved with this solution, by allowing a number of user interfaces that are optimally designed for the respective usage or application to be selected and by allowing the point in time for activation of a user interface to be arbitrarily determined by the user.
[0021] In principle it is also possible for only one user interface to be generated for a respective usage or application, as is known in the prior art; but according to the invention a number of user interfaces can be respectively generated for a number of applications. This is particularly of importance in the medical technology environment since a magnetic resonance apparatus requires a very complex control that is based on a wide variety of different applications. Moreover, the respective applications can be applied in different medical contexts and by different persons. Different control elements or parameters may be necessary depending on the context or person, such that it is meaningful to also generate a number of user interfaces for the same application. An n:n relation thus arises between generated user interfaces and associated applications. This affords further degrees of freedom in the control of the medical apparatus.
[0022] In another embodiment of the invention, the method starts with an existing user interface and alters (in particular expands or limits) the presented control elements and/or the presented control groups thereof. Upon generation of a new user interface, the user does not have to unnecessarily reconfigure already-existing control elements again, but rather can already start from predefined elements. This produces a significant time gain in the generation of user interfaces. Moreover, a safety aspect is also achieved because the user is made aware of necessary control elements for the respective application, and thus these elements cannot be accidentally omitted in the generation of the user interface for that application.
