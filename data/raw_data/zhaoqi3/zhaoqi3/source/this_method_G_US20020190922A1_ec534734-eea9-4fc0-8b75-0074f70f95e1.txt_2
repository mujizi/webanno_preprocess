[0050] When micro-mirror type SLMs, such as DMD and TMA, are used, it is preferred to align the display panel so that the tilting plane of the micro-mirrors is not on the same plane as the plane of illumination beams separation (i.e. not on x-y plane in terms of FIG. 10c). This is also to minimize the effect of the angular difference among the separated illumination beams on the performance of those display devices, since they basically use the tilting angle of micro-mirror to control the reflective intensity of a pixel.
[0051] When a FLC SLM is used as the image source, it is required that the electric charge applied over the electrodes of each FLC cell be balanced by displaying an inverted frame corresponding to each positive (non-inverted) frames to be projected. In an inverted frame, the polarization axis of the light carrying the image is perpendicular to the polarization axis of the image light on a positive frame. In order to project both positive and inverted frames and be able to see them as all-positive images, a polarization rotator can be used to switch the polarization axis of each inverted frame and thus convert it into a positive frame. However, because the FLC SLM is a reflective type display, which requires the illumination beam and the reflected beam share a lot of common space in front of the panel, the polarization switching arrangement is compounded by the projection optics arrangement. The basic solution is a combination of off-axis projection principle with the use of TIR (total internal reflection) prisms. A preferred setup is shown in FIG. 11. The TIR prism 140 allows a tight folding of the illumination beam 1101A and the reflected beam 1 101B so that optics on the illumination end and on the reflection end can fit in without interference. This is called off-axis projection because the projection beam 1101B is off an axis normal to the surface of the FLC SLM 1305. The basic requirement on the TIR setup is that the illumination beam and the reflection beam must intersect the TIR surface 1401 at two slightly different angles, one corresponds to total internal reflection and one corresponds to transmission. A linear polarizer 1160 polarizes all illumination light before the light reaching the SLM 130. The polarization rotator can be placed at 1170A or 1170B or 1170C and operate according to the status of image frame on the SLM. A clean up polarizer 1161 can be placed after the projection lens 160 to make sure all projected frames are in the preferred polarization.
[0052] Usually, on a FLC SLM, an inverted image frame is displayed immediately after one positive (non-inverted) frame is displayed in order to balance the electric charge applied to the FLC cells. Correspondingly, the switchable polarization rotator must change states at each frame. Since the FLC has a finite response time, there is a short transition period when the SLM inverts its image. During this transition period, the image has poor contrast. As frame rate increases, the effect of this transition period can appear. Also, this method of charge balance reduces affective frame rate, since every two successive frames look the same after the polarization rotator. Instead of the above "frame-by-frame" balance, a preferred method to balance charge is "stack-by-stack" balance, which displays a number of all-positive frames successively and then displays their inverted frames successively. The switchable polarization rotator changes states from stack to stack. This display method improves contrast at high frame rate.
[0053] FIG. 12a illustrates a preferred gray scale projector embodiment. The SLM is of the types that do not depend on polarization of illuminating light, such as DMD or TMA or the like. Again, the drawing assumes the SLM as transmissive type for convenience of explanation. The polarization beamsplitter 1220, TIR prism 223 and two reflectors 224 and 225 separate the illumination beam into two paths. The display panel 130 is therefore defined with two sub-panels, each illuminated with light of a different polarization (P or S). After the projection lens, a similar optical setup merges the two sub-panels on a projection screen at a distance. A second aperture plate 911 is inserted into one of the two paths to create scaled illumination on the two sub-panels. For example, if on each sub-panel one pixel contains four sub-pixels of equal size, then the gray level of one pixel is 5 (0-4). If the illumination intensity over the two sub-panels are scaled as 1:5, then the combined gray level is 25 (5.times.5).
[0054] FIG. 12b illustrates still another preferred embodiment of gray scale projector. The display panel is the type based on polarization, such as a FLC SLM. The setup is basically similar to that of FIG. 12a, except for a few additional components. Polarization difference is used for separation of illumination paths and for merging of the two sub-panels. However, because the display image is also based on difference of polarization, some special treatments with use of additional components are needed. First, the images on the two sub-panels are defined to always have different polarization states. That is, when sub-panel 130A displays images of P state and background of S state, then sub-panel 130B displays images of S state and background of P state. In this way, the images from the two sub-panels can be separated by the polarizing beamsplitter 1221 into two paths and then merged together at a distance 180. A 1/2-wave plate 1265 is therefore needed to turn the polarization axis of one of the two images 90 degree, so that both images are projected with the same polarization state. A screen aperture 1212 is also needed to block unwanted half images from reaching the screen. Again, the polarization rotator 1270 and is used for projecting inverted image frames.
