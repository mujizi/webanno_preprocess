In the first prior art apparatus, color difference information is thinned down in a video data compression procedure considering the processing speed of the reproduction apparatus. Compensating the thinned down color difference information by simple interpolation, the decompression procedure of the video data is performed at a high speed, enabling synchronized reproduction of the video data and the audio data.
In another Japanese patent application entitled "Variable speed synchronized playback of recorded digital audio and video data" and laid open as a Provisional Publication No. 303240/'95 (hereafter called the second prior art apparatus), there is proposed another method of synchronized playback with a variable speed of the audio signal component and the video signal component.
In this method, a time required for decompression and playback of a frame of the video signal component, and a time required for decompression and reproduction of a block of the audio signal component are calculated from respective attribute information of each thereof. One of the calculated times is used as a master time clock for decompession of the audio signal component and the video signal component. The audio signal component and the video signal component are decompressed more speedily or more slowly according to a scaling factor of the master time clock indicated by a user.
There are also Japanese parent applications laid open as Provisional Publication No. 87324/'95 and No. 121276/'94 (hereafter called the third prior apparatus). In the third prior apparatus, the video signal component of a picture frame is compressed together with the audio signal component corresponding to the picture frame, and when data compression procedure of the video signal component is found to be delayed from that of the audio signal component, data compression of a part or a whole of the picture frame is omitted. In the same way, when data decompression of the video signal component is found to be lagged from that of the audio signal component in the reproduction, decompression of a part or a whole of the picture frame is omitted.
Thus, a synchronized reproduction of the AV signals is realized. Furthermore, having such a data stream as above mentioned, reproduction from a desired part of the AV signals can be performed in synchronization, in the third prior apparatus.
