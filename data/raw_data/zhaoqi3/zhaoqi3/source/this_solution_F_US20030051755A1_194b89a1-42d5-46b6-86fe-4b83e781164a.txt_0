[0068] FIG. 3 aims to explain, in theory, the operation of the hand wheel 110 being turned over less than one turn (360.degree.).
[0069] In the light of this FIG. 3, it will be understood that the torque KK' applied to the hand wheel 110 generates force on the stop, which force is higher, the closer the stop is located to the axis about which the hand wheel rotates.
[0070] Thus, for a stop 63 located at the distance "d", the force is "E"; for a stop 64 located at a distance "D", the force is "e" with e/E=D/d. The force could have been reduced a bit further with a stop 65 secured to the body and a stop 55 secured to the hand wheel both located outside the hand wheel, but for esthetic reasons and above all for ergonomic reasons, this solution, which incurs the risk of hands becoming trapped in the space 56, is less satisfactory than those proposed in the other figures.
[0071] The present invention therefore offers several advantages over the known devices, particularly an ease of operation because the angular travel of the hand wheel is limited to less than one turn, that is to say markedly less than 360.degree., which makes it possible to eliminate the risks of parallax error, of confusion between the maximum setting and minimum setting positions and makes the hand wheel easier for the operator to operate.
[0072] It is also to be emphasized that choosing excessively restricted angular travels for the hand wheel, for example over 180.degree. or less, leads to a great reduction in the sensitivity and precision of the adjustment.
