Electrophoretic Detection of Nucleic Acid Target Molecules without Amplification
FIG. 16 depicts a further embodiment of the invention where an analytical procedure is performed in a device with reaction components being transferred electrophoretically. The component parts of this device, and their method of use are broadly similar to Examples 6 and 7 depicted by FIGS. 14 and 15 above. However, the device illustrated as FIG. 16 conducts analyses by hybridization of nucleic acids without prior amplification and detects the hybridized target nucleic species at their capture site on a gel with a simpler device without the requirement for a separate detection compartment.
The overall analytical sequence is essentially similar to the examples above, with sample input and sample preparation optionally including cell lysis in the Sample Preparation Compartment, and electrophoretically induced migration of nucleic acid species between compartments. In this case, one or more nucleic acids of interest within the applied sample are hybridized to a detectably labeled probe within the Sample Preparation Compartment using reagents provided for this purpose within this compartment either as a solution or by the applied sample dissolving dried or lyophilized reagents. Alternatively, these reagents can be added to this compartment during the initial stage of the analysis such as by entry though the same or similar means as entry of the applied sample. The applied sample and provided reagents are mixed and permitted to react for a time period on the order of tens of seconds or minutes for the lysis and hybridization processes to be sufficiently complete. Optionally, this process may be assisted by heating the sample and reagent mixture in order to assist with denaturation of the target nucleic acids and their hybridization to probes.
When the target nucleic acids in the sample, being those nucleic acids of interest for which hybridization probes have been provided, have been hybridized as above, electrophoretic voltages are applied to migrate the nucleic acid species into the gel. Initially, a voltage on the order of 0.1 to 10 of volts/cm is applied for a period on the order of tens of seconds to 120 minutes between Electrode 1 and Electrode 3 to cause migration of the hybridized nucleic acids into some area of the set of gels. When sufficient time has elapsed for the hybridized target nucleic acids to have migrated into a gel, the voltages are reapplied to Electrode 2 and Electrode 3 to continue the migration of hybridized target nucleic acid towards Electrode 3. As the target nucleic acids migrate through Gel 2, they encounter complementary capture probes that are immobilized to the gel such as by covalent linkage with acrylamide moieties that are co-polymerized into an acrylamide gel. These capture probes are complementary to a different part of the target nucleic acid in order the time target nucleic acid can be simultaneously hybridized to both types of probe. If the applied sample contains one or more target nucleic acids having sequences complementary to those of the capture probes, said target nucleic acid species become captured on Gel 2 at this point, whereas other nucleic acid species will continue to migrate through and past the capture compartment into another area of the device such as Gel 3 and will ultimately encounter Electrode 3. The electrophoretic voltage is applied for sufficient time for all hybridized target nucleic acids to have reached the capture compartment on Gel 2 and for other nucleic acids, particularly non-hybridized detectable labeled nucleic acid probes, to have migrated through and away from the capture compartment. This electrophoretic migration phase can be continued for sufficient time for other chemical species potentially interfering with the analysis to also have migrated distinct from the capture compartment. Depending on the device dimension and format and the actual value of the applied electrophoretic voltage, this time can range from the order of tens of seconds to minutes. As a simpler alternative, this phase of electrophoretic migration can be induced by continuing to apply the voltage between Electrode 1 and Electrode 2, however this can cause interfering chemical species to continue to enter Gel 1 and potentially interfere with the analysis.
When all or a sufficient number of the hybridized target nucleic acids have passed into the capture compartment of Gel 2 and been captured, while the other interfering species particularly unhybridized labeled probes have migrated past the capture compartment, the electrophoretic migration can be terminated. The one or more target nucleic acids can then be detected by their presence in the capture zone. Such detection can be accomplished by a variety of known means including the use of fluorescent probes, or enzyme probes operating with some substrate present as a reagent in solution such as a fluorogenic substrate or a chemiluminescent substrate.
