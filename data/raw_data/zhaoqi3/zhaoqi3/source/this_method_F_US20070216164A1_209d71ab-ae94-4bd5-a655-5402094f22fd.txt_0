[0014] All the previously mentioned U.S. patents and other existing solutions on variable speed wind turbines that include power electronics have converters connected to the grid. Depending on the technology used on the converters, there are different ranges of harmonics introduced on the grid which must be attenuated by using filters, and tuned to the final application location, making the systems more expensive and less reliable.
[0015] In view of these problems in the prior art, there is a need to provide an improved power solution, which may be applied to variable speed wind turbines.
[0016] Another undesirable problem, especially in the case of weak grids, is the reactive power consumption during the synchronization of the generator. For example, a synchronization method is described in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,600,240. This method starts connecting the generator stator to the grid while the power converter is disabled and the rotor has reached a predefined speed. At this moment, the full magnetizing current is supplied by the grid, which causes a reactive power consumption. This reactive power consumption is sometimes not allowed by some new grid compliance regulations. This patent also describes a disconnection process. The process starts reducing the rotor current and disabling the rotor converter. In this moment, the reactive magnetizing current is supplied by the grid. To disconnect the generator the contactor is opened with reactive current, decreasing the operational life of the contactor. Accordingly, there is a need to provide a method for synchronization, connection and disconnection to the grid of the doubly fed induction generator, which avoids the consumption of reactive power and increases the lifetime of connecting devices.
[0017] Another aspect that determines the power quality injected to the grid is the control of the generator. One type of control of the generator side converter is known as "field orientated control" (FOC). The FOC method is based on the electrical model and the parameters of the machine. Due to the dispersion of the machine parameters, the torque can not be accurately calculated, and additional online adjusting loops are required. Moreover, the FOC method that is used introduces delays in the flux position identification when a fault occurs in the grid, making it more difficult to fulfill the new grid compliance requirements.
[0018] In prior art variable speed wind turbines with DFIG configuration, although the stator power remains constant, the rotor power is also fed into the grid through the power converter. Due to the rotor power ripple, the total power fed into the grid is also rippled, affecting the output power quality of the wind turbine.
