[0032] Although the MRAM architecture described in the above-identified co-pending application functions well for its intended purpose, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that an additional reduction in write current, and the attendant reduction in power consumed, is desirable.
[0033] The present invention provides a method and system for providing a magnetic memory. The method and system comprise providing a plurality of magnetic memory elements and providing at least one wrapped write line. Each wrapped write line includes a bottom write line and a top write line electrically connected to the bottom write line. The bottom write line resides below a portion of the plurality of magnetic elements, while the top write resides above the portion of the plurality of magnetic elements. The bottom write line carries a first current in a first direction, while the top write line carries a second current in a second direction opposite to the first direction.
[0034] The present invention will be described in terms of particular types of magnetic memory elements, particular materials, and a particular configuration of elements. For example, the present invention will be described in the context of illustrative magnetic random access memory (MRAM) cells. One of ordinary skill in the art will, however, recognize that the present invention is not limited to any particular magnetic memory devices. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily realize that this method and system will operate effectively for other magnetic memory cells, and other materials and configurations non inconsistent with the present invention. Instead, the present invention is applicable to other magnetic memory devices. For example, although certain magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) stacks are described, nothing prevents the use of other materials, other alloys and synthetic layers, or other magnetic elements. In addition, although the present invention is described in the context of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices and MTJ stacks, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the present invention is not limited to such devices. Instead, other suitable devices, for example bipolar junction transistor devices and spin-valve giant magnetoresistive memory elements, may be similarly used, with or without modification to the memory architecture. One of ordinary skill in the art will also readily recognize that although the present invention is described in the conjunction of certain other components, such as word and bit lines, including certain materials. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that other components and/or components using different materials not inconsistent with the present invention can be used. Moreover, the present invention is described in the context of single constituents, such as a single MTJ stack and single write lines. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the method and system apply to and operate effectively for systems having multiple constituents of each type such as multiple magnetic elements, multiple bit lines, and multiple word lines.
[0035] To more particularly illustrate the method and system in accordance with the present invention, refer now to FIG. 3 depicting a high-level block diagram of a portion of one embodiment of a magnetic memory 100 utilizing a wrapped write line in accordance with present invention. The magnetic memory includes a magnetic memory cell 110 and a wrapped write line 120. In a preferred embodiment, the magnetic memory cell 110 includes only a magnetic element 112. However, in an alternate embodiment, the magnetic memory cell 110 could include other components (not shown), such as a transistor. The magnetic element 112 is preferably an MTJ stack. However, in another embodiment, other magnetic elements could be used.
[0036] The wrapped write line 120 includes a bottom write line 122, a top write line 124, a connector 126 and, in one embodiment, an optional conductor 128. The magnetic memory cell 110 is preferably written using two write lines the wrapped write line 120 and a second write line (not shown). The wrapped write line 120 could be either a bit line or a word line. Consequently, in one embodiment, the top write line 124 of the wrapped write line 120 is electrically connected to the magnetic element 112, for example by being fabricated directly on the magnetic element 110 or by being coupled through optional conductor 128. However, in another embodiment, the wrapped write line 120 is electrically isolated from the magnetic element 112. The connector 126 preferably electrically connects the top write line 124 with the bottom write line 122. In one embodiment, the connector 126 is a conductive plug that is fabricated between the lines 122 and 124 that exist at different levels of the magnetic memory 100. Thus, current can be driven through the bottom write line 122 to the top write line 124, or vice versa.
