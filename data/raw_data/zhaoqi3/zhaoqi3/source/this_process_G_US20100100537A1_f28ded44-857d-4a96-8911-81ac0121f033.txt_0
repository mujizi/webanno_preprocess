[0104] For evaluation purposes, the candidate phrase is typically assigned to an agent of a passive state (or, "first state"). The passive state (or "first state") refers to the state in which the agent has not yet evaluated a candidate phrase whereby a threshold has been met and the active state (or "second state") refers to the state in which the agent has evaluated a phrase and has met an evaluation threshold. Generally, there is a different threshold associated with different types of trending parameters. The agent can generate a score (e.g., via the scoring module) based on a configured type of trending parameter and for comparison with the threshold. Multiple phrases can be assigned to each of the multiple agents in the first passive state. The agents can then determine whether the assigned candidate phrase meets an associated threshold to qualify as a potential trended phrase which corresponds to a trend or otherwise popular topic.
[0105] The collective states of agents (e.g., whether the agents are in the passive or active state) and the words or phrases that they became active evaluating are used to identify trended phrases which correspond to trends. Once the candidate phrases have each been assigned to agents and have been evaluated, the process proceeds as follows. For a first agent that has evaluated a phrase/word and reached the evaluation threshold (e.g., of a second state), the trend analysis engine 228 selects another agent and determines whether the selected agent is also in the second state. If so, the engine 228 determines whether the selected agent reached threshold analyzing the same phrase/word as the first agent. If so, the first agent is deactivated back to the first state.
[0106] This process is further illustrated diagrammatically in the example of FIG. 5. The down-weighting allows negative feedback looping to mitigate the effect of false positives. Since the probability that an active agent contacts an agent evaluating the same word/phrase increases with cluster size, the down-weighting keeps groups from growing too fast and activating more agents than needed.
[0107] For a second agent that has evaluated a phrase/word and remains in the first state (e.g., has not reached evaluation threshold), the analysis engine 228 selects another agent which is configured to use the same trending parameter for analysis as the second agent. The analysis engine 228 can detect whether the selected agent has reached evaluation threshold and if so, the engine 228 changes the state of the second agent to an activated state (e.g., second state). Furthermore, the analysis engine 228 can detect the candidate phrase/word (e.g., or "hypothesis") which the selected trend analysis agent reached evaluation threshold with and such word/phrase is also assigned to the second agent such that the second agent is now in active same with the same phrase/word. However, if the selected agent also has not reached evaluation threshold, the state of the second agent is also maintained in the first state (inactive state).
[0108] This process can be repeated for all agents and is illustrated diagrammatically in the example of FIG. 5. A candidate phrase can be identified as a trended phrase based on the number or percentage of trend analysis agents that are active with the phrase/word (e.g., having reached threshold in the second state). The agents may have reached the active state through analyzing the phrase or through assignment based on the state of a neighboring agent.
