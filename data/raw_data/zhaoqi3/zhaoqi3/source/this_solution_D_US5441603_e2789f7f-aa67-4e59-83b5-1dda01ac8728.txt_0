This step uniformly distributes the aqueous alkaline solution throughout the low consistency brownstock and ensures that substantially all the brownstock fibers are exposed to a uniform application of alkaline solution. Surprisingly, the brownstock pulp treated in this manner is not substantially delignified in the treatment step, but it is more effectively delignified in the subsequent high consistency oxygen delignification step than brownstock that is treated with alkaline solutions at high consistency according to the methods conventionally employed. The localized inhomogeneities in the distribution of alkali in conventional high consistency pulp are avoided, thus eliminating attendant non-uniform oxygen delignification.
This homogeneous distribution step thus preferably comprises uniformly combining the pulp with an aqueous alkaline solution for at least about i minute and preferably no more than about 15 minutes. It is believed that treatment times of less than about 1 minute will not generally provide sufficient time to attain substantially uniform distribution, whereas treatment times in excess of about 15 minutes are not expected to produce substantial further benefit.
Moreover, the preferred alkaline treatment of pulp according to the present invention may be carried out over a wide range of temperature conditions. According to a preferred practice, the treatment step is carried out at a temperature of from about room temperature to about 150.degree. F., with temperatures ranging from about 90.degree. F. to about 150.degree. F. being even more preferred. Atmospheric pressure or elevated pressure may be employed. The treatment step is completed when the aqueous alkaline solution is substantially uniformly distributed throughout the low consistency pulp. The amount of aqueous alkaline solution present in the treatment step can vary greatly according to the particular process parameters of the delignification reaction. The amount of the alkaline solution effective for the purpose of the present invention will depend primarily upon the extent of delignification desired in the oxygen bleaching step and the strength of the particular solution being used. The aqueous alkaline solutions preferably used comprise a sodium hydroxide solution having a concentration of from about 20 to about 120 g/l. This solution is mixed with the low consistency pulp, so that the overall mixture has a concentration of alkaline material of between about 6.5 and 13.5 g/l, and preferably around 9 g/l. Thus, for a 5 to 15 minute treatment of a 3 to 5 percent consistency pulp at temperatures between 120.degree. to 150.degree. F. at these concentrations of alkaline material, a uniform distribution of such alkaline material is obtained throughout the pulp.
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is added to the low consistency pulp in an amount sufficient to provide from about 15% to about 30% by weight of sodium hydroxide based on dry pulp weight. Other alkaline sources having an equivalent sodium hydroxide content, such as oxidized white liquor from the conventional Kraft recovery and regeneration cycle, may also be employed.
Following the low consistency caustic treatment step described above, the consistency of the treated pulp is increased to greater than about 20%, preferably from about 25% to about 35%. Several methods are available and well known in the art for increasing the consistency of the pulp, such as pressing the wood pulp to remove liquid therefrom.
