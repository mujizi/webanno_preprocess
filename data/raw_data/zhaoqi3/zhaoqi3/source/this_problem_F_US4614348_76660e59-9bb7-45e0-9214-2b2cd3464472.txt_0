When the coupling parts 10 and 12 are fully interconnected as shown in FIG. 1 the valve sleeve 38 will be sealingly located within seal 24, and the ball detents 50 will be held in the groove 30 by ring 46. Full fluid flow occurs through the head 36 and about valve 18 and the coupling is in its operative position as illustrated.
During the coupling and uncoupling of the parts 10 and 12 the seal 24 will be exposed to fluid pressure within the copuling part 10 after the valve 18 is removed from engagement with the seal, and prior to the valve sleeve 38 entering the seal 24. During these instances, especially during the connect cycle when the male part 10 is pressurized, the exposure of the seal 24 to the hydraulic pressure may cause the unsupported seal to "blow-out" of its associated gland recess 26 and in accord with the inventive concepts such an occurrence is prevented.
FIG. 2 illustrates a common prior art type of seal used with the coupling shown in FIG. 1. The gland recess 26 defined in the male part 10 receives an elastomeric O-ring 52 and an annular retaining ring 54. This type of arrangement did not prevent blow-out of the O-ring 52 as the O-ring is directly exposed to the fluid and would be deformed by the hydraulic fluid pressure during connection and disconnection, and would often be blown from the recess 26. To overcome this problem a seal constructed as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 has been successful.
With reference to FIG. 3, the seal 24 is located within the male coupling part gland recess 26. The recess 26 includes radially extending slightly converging sides 56, tangential radii 58, and a cylindrical base surface 60. The gland recess 26 with which the seal of FIG. 3 is employed is the same recess of FIG. 2, and it is to be appreciated that the seal in accord with the invention may be retrofitted to existing fluid couplings without modification to the coupling.
The seal 24 in accord with the invention consists of two components, an annular body 62, and the elastomeric O-ring 64. The body 62 is formed of a semi-rigid synthetic plastic material, such as virgin polytetrafluoroethylene sold under the trademark Teflon by the Dupont Company, and this material has commonly been used for seals in fluid systems because of its compatibility with many types of fluids, strength, and self-lubricative qualities.
