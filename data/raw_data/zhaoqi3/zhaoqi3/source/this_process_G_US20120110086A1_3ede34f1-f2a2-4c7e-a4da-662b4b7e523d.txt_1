[0086] Thereafter, a determination is made as to whether the blade is entitled to be made available for use, INQUIRY 806. For instance, in one particular example, a customer pays for a particular number of blades to be managed under control of the Unified Resource Manager. So, a decision is made as to whether the customer has exceeded the paid for allocation. If so, a report, such as an error report, is provided to the customer, STEP 808. Otherwise, the blade is entitled to be used. (There may be additional or different tests for entitlement.) The support element then accepts the blade as entitled, and initiates the process to configure the blade and to deploy the required Unified Resource Manager firmware on the blade, which may include the deployment and initialization of a hypervisor, STEP 810.
[0087] In one particular example, a portion of the firmware to be installed is a hypervisor on the blade. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the hypervisors to be used are shipped with the hybrid system, and stored on storage 256 (FIG. 2B) associated with the support element. Thus, the customers are relieved of the explicit responsibility for installing the hypervisors.
[0088] One embodiment of the logic used to install a hypervisor on a blade is described with reference to FIG. 9. Initially, the AMM of the blade center chassis containing the blade on which the hypervisor is to be installed obtains an indication from the support element that the hypervisor installation boot image for the hypervisor is to be obtained from the support element, STEP 900. Then, a command is sent from the support element to the AMM in the blade center chassis informing the AMM to initiate a boot of the hypervisor installation boot image from the support element by the selected blade, STEP 902. The hypervisor installation image begins to boot, STEP 904. This boot step begins the execution of the hypervisor installation process on the blade, which transfers the hypervisor installation image from the hard disk of the support element onto the local storage resident on the blade, STEP 906. At the completion of this process, the hypervisor is now installed on the local storage of the blade and can be booted from that storage by the Unified Resource Manager upon subsequent activation of the blade.
[0089] The supplying of the hypervisors from the support element provides encapsulation in that the support element supplies the firmware and other code that is to run natively on the blades. The support element is thus able to exclusively control the configuration (e.g., paging, etc.), function and operation of the blade. A pre-selected set of configuration decisions have been included with the firmware, relieving the customer from making those decisions. Further, the hypervisor is configured so that it only directly communicates across the management network. The hypervisor is configured so that it accepts management orders only from the support element that is connected to the management network.
[0090] Subsequent to installing the hypervisor, virtual servers may be provisioned thereon to enable customer work to be performed. A virtual server is comprised of an allocation of the required physical server resources, including, for instance, a number of CPUs (dedicated versus shared), memory, and I/O and network resources. To deploy a virtual server, a description of the virtual server resources is used by the Unified Resource Manager to create a virtual server on a specific hypervisor allocating the required platform resources. A bootable software disk image is copied to the storage resources bound to the virtual server and the virtual server is started from the bootable disk image.
