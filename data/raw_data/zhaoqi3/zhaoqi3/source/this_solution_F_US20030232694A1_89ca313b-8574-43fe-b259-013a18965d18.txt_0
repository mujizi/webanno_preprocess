[0010] In a preferred configuration of the invention, a member essentially has the contour and volume of an intermediate space, such that essentially constant spacers are formed between the member and the gears surrounding the member. The spacers are dimensioned such that along the cylindrically curved envelope surface of each gear (sun gear, planet gear, and ring gear) there is preferably as small and constant as possible a distance to the surfaces of the members, wherein the surfaces of the members likewise have cylindrically curved envelope surfaces and correspond to the envelope surfaces of the gears, so that the contour of the members is essentially fitted to the geometry of the gears. Thus, the smaller the spacers, the larger the filled volume of the intermediate spaces and the smaller the slip losses in the planetary gear train. Here, it should be noted that a configuration of the planetary gear train with larger spacers can also be advantageous, i.e., intermediate spaces that are not significantly filled also produce a reduction of the slip losses and thus an optimization of the gear efficiency.
[0011] In another preferred configuration of the invention, the planet carrier and the members are manufactured from one part, e.g., cast in one piece. The one-piece configuration is advantageous because no assembly of the members on the planet carrier is required and the production costs can be reduced.
[0012] In an alternative configuration of the invention, the members are formed separately and attached to the planet carrier. The members can be attached to the planet carrier by screws, alignment pins, seams, welds, or other connections. The advantage of this solution is that the planet carrier and the members can consist of different materials and a less rigid and lighter material can be used for the members.
[0013] In an especially preferred configuration of the invention for preferably single support-frame planet carriers, a sealing plate is on the end surfaces of the members opposite the planet carrier. The sealing plate covers the members and the planet gears. Covering the planet gears with the sealing plate produces additional optimization of the efficiency, because the rotation of the planets affects the gear oil bath only to a reduced degree. The sealing plate is preferably formed separately and attached to the members or the planet carrier. The sealing plate can be attached to the members or to the planet carrier by screws, alignment pins, seams, welds, or other connections. In an alternative configuration of the invention, the sealing plate and the members are formed preferably in one piece and attached together to the planet carrier, which eliminates the need for attachment means for the sealing plate.
[0014] In another preferred configuration of the invention, at least one surface of the members facing the gears and, if necessary, the sealing plate, is profiled. Here, flow tracks are preferably formed in the surface of the members to produce a flow-optimized interaction between the surface and the gear oil. The flow tracks are thus preferably formed on the cylindrically curved outer surface of the members and preferably run in the direction of rotation of the gears. Furthermore, the attachment of other flow-optimizing profiles is conceivable, as in, e.g., a scale pattern or the like.
