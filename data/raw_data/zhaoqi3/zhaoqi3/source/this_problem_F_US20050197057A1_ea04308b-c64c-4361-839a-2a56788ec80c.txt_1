[0007] Another solution to this problem has been achieved with the use of what is commonly referred to as an "air curtain". An air curtain eliminates physical barriers at the doorway and facilitates unobstructed passage through the doorway. An air curtain is formed by an apparatus having an air mover producing a relatively high velocity air stream across the doorway, either from side to side or top to bottom, to counteract the forces of the infiltrating air masses. The air curtain apparatus may also contain a heater to condition the air stream flowing through it and reduce or prevent fogging or precipitation at the doorway, which may otherwise have occurred as the air stream mixes with the warm and cool air masses while passing across the doorway.
[0008] A problem that must be addressed by an air curtain doorway is mixing of the air that is intended to form the curtain with the warm side air and with the cold side air. The width of these doorways can be considerable, for example ten feet or more, and ideally all of the air that is blown out of the supply side of the doorway, and no other air, is sucked into the return side of the doorway for recirculation through the doorway. Sucking in the warm moist air can result in the formation of ice, which requires running the heaters to keep ice from forming, and sucking in the cold air also forms ice, which requires running the heaters, and creates an additional load for the refrigerated room refrigeration system. Running the heaters, of course, results in energy inefficiency and increased costs.
[0009] The typical solutions in the prior art have been to increase the volume of air flow across the doorway, run multiple airflows, or simply run the heaters more. The present invention addresses this problem to minimize the mixing of warm side and cold side air with the air curtain stream.
[0010] The present invention addresses these problems by producing an air curtain which exits a relatively thin outlet aperture at the supply and is collected in a collector chamber at the return prior to entering restrictions that are downstream of the collector chamber.
[0011] In particular, the present invention is an air curtain doorway for forming an air curtain across a doorway between a relatively low temperature area and a relatively high temperature area. The doorway includes duct work having a supply air duct, a return air duct and an intermediate air duct. The supply air duct is located at a first side of the doorway and has an outlet aperture extending substantially the height of the first side. The return air duct is located at the second, opposite side of the doorway and has an inlet aperture extending substantially the height of the second side. The intermediate air duct joins the supply and return air ducts. An air mover draws an air stream through the duct work into the inlet aperture to the return air duct, through the intermediate air duct to the supply air duct, and out the outlet aperture. One or more nozzles can be provided to extend along substantially the entire outlet aperture of the supply air duct and direct the air stream toward the return air duct.
