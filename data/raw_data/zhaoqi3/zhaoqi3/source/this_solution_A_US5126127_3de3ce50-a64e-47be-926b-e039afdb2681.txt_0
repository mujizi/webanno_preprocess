Accelerated stability studies were conducted for the above formulation. In order to remain within the definition of stability for a PVP-I solution as defined in the USP for 0.3% PVP-I solutions, the maximum allowable limits for the above formulation was 0.36% PVP-I and minimum was 0.25% PVP-I. Thus, stability of a 0.30% solution should be above 0.25% PVP-I (or 0.025% available iodine) to be considered stable. The formulation fell below this level after three months at room temperature, and after one month at 40.degree. C. and 80% relative humidity. Therefore, the stability of these solutions in glass bottles cannot be maintained.
EXAMPLE 2
A non-isotonic 0.3% PVP-I solution was prepared which was not buffered at the above pH of 5.4, but only with adjusting the pH at 4.0. The formula for this solution was as follows:
Three batches of the above formula were made and tested for stability. The results are provided in Table 3 below.
Surprisingly, it was discovered that stability of the PVP-I solution was maintained for a period of 3 years, in amber glass bottles, using the USP allowable overage of 20% extra PVP-I.
