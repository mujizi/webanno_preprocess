Hydrogenolysis of Poly(DTBn-Adipate)
Preparation
In a 500 mL pressure bottle was placed 21 g of poly(DTBn-adipate) having a M.sub.w of 76.8 Kda and M.sub.n of 43.7 Kda. To the bottle was then added 200 mL of DMF and the mixture was stirred until a clear solution was obtained. To this solution were added 4 g of 5% Pd on BaSO.sub.4 catalyst. The pressure bottle was attached to the Parr hydrogenator and the air inside the bottle was displaced with hydrogen by alternatively pressurizing with hydrogen and then depressurizing. The bottle was maintained at a hydrogen pressure of 60 psi and then subjected to shaking for 24 h. An aliquot was withdrawn and after suitable treatment examined by .sup.1 H NMR which showed complete removal of the benzyl group. The reaction was stopped and the reaction mixture was centrifuged. The supernatant was filtered using a celite bed on a sintered glass funnel. The filtrate was added to 2.0 L of cooled deionized water in a high speed blender. The precipitated product was isolated by filtration and washed with 2.0 L of water. The product was dried in a stream of nitrogen for 16 h and then dried in vacuum oven at room temperature for 2 days.
Structure Proof
The .sup.1 H NMR spectrum of the product in DMSO-d.sub.6 showed the following resonances (.delta., ppm relative to TMS): 8.26 (br s, 0.95H, NH), 7.00-7.09 (m, 8H, aromatic H's), 4.71 (m, 1H, CH of tyrosine), 2.2-3.3 (m, 10H, CH.sub.2 's of DAT, Tyrosine and CH.sub.1 --CO--), 1.74 (t, 4H, CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 of adipate). Also, a multiplet that is found in poly(DTBn-adipate) at 5.1 due to benzyl H's was completely absent, indicating complete removal of the benzyl protecting groups. Also, the amide NH peaks had shifted from 8.45 ppm in poly(DTBn-adipate) to 8.26 ppm. The phenyl resonance of the benzyl group at 7.35 ppm was also absent in the product. No other significant changes in the spectrum were observed.
