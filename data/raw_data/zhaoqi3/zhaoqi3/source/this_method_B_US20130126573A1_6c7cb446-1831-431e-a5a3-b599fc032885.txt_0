[0005] Alternatively, laser ablation can also be improved at the surface of transparent media by reducing the duration of the laser pulse. This is especially advantageous for lasers that are transparent inside the processing medium. When focused onto or inside transparent materials, the high laser intensity induces nonlinear absorption effects to provide a dynamic opacity that can be controlled to accurately deposit appropriate laser energy into a small volume of the material as defined by the focal volume. The short duration of the pulse offers several further advantages over longer duration laser pulses such as eliminating plasma reflections and reducing collateral damage through the small component of thermal diffusion and other heat transport effects during the much shorter time scale of such laser pulses. Femtosecond and picosecond laser ablation therefore offer significant benefits in machining of both opaque and transparent materials. However, machining of transparent materials with pulses even as short as tens to hundreds of femtosecond is also associated with the formation of rough surfaces and microcracks in the vicinity of laser-formed hole or trench that is especially problematic for brittle materials like glasses and optical crystals. Further, ablation debris will contaminate the nearby sample and surrounding surfaces.
[0006] A kerf-free method of cutting or scribing glass and related materials relies on a combination of laser heating and cooling, for example, with a CO2 laser and a water jet. [U.S. Pat. No. 5,609,284 (Kondratenko); U.S. Pat. No. 6,787,732 UV laser (Xuan)] Under appropriate conditions of heating and cooling in close proximity, high tensile stresses are generated that induces cracks deep into the material, that can be propagated in flexible curvilinear paths by simply scanning the laser-cooling sources across the surface. In this way, thermal-stress induced scribing provides a clean splitting of the material without the disadvantages of a mechanical scribe or diamond saw, and with no component of laser ablation to generate debris. However, the method relies on stress-induced crack formation to direct the scribe and requires [WO/2001/032571 LASER DRIVEN GLASS CUT-INITIATION] a mechanical or laser means to initiate the crack formation. Short duration laser pulses generally offer the benefit of being able to propagate efficiently inside transparent materials, and locally induce modification inside the bulk by nonlinear absorption processes at the focal position of a lens. However, the propagation of ultrafast laser pulses (>.about.5 MW peak power) in transparent optical media is complicated by the strong reshaping of the spatial and temporal profile of the laser pulse through a combined action of linear and nonlinear effects such as group-velocity dispersion (GVD), linear diffraction, self-phase modulation (SPM), self-focusing, multiphoton/tunnel ionization (MPI/TI) of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, plasma defocusing, and self-steepening [S L Chin et al. Canadian Journal of Physics, 83, 863-905 (2005)]. These effects play out to varying degrees that depend on the laser parameters, material nonlinear properties, and the focusing condition into the material.
[0007] Kamata et al. [SPIE Proceedings 6881-46, High-speed scribing of flat-panel display glasses by use of a 100-kHz, 10-W femtosecond laser, M. Kamata, T. Imahoko, N. Inoue, T. Sumiyoshi, H. Sekita, Cyber Laser Inc. (Japan); M. Obara, Keio Univ. (Japan)] describe a high speed scribing technique for flat panel display (FPD) glasses. A 100-kHz Ti:sapphire chirped-pulse-amplified laser of frequency-doubled 780 nm, 300 fs, 100 .mu.J output was focused into the vicinity of the rear surface of a glass substrate to exceed the glass damage threshold, and generate voids by optical breakdown of the material. The voids reach the back surface due to the high repetition rate of the laser. The connected voids produce internal stresses and damage as well as surface ablation that facilitate dicing by mechanical stress or thermal shock in a direction along the laser scribe line. While this method potentially offers fast scribe speeds of 300 mm/s, there exists a finite kerf width, surface damage, facet roughness, and ablation debris as the internally formed voids reach the surface.
SUMMARY
[0008] In a first embodiment, there is provided a method of preparing a substrate for cleavage, the method comprising the steps of: irradiating the substrate with one or more pulses of a focused laser beam, wherein the substrate is transparent to the laser beam, and wherein the one or more of pulses have an energy and pulse duration selected to produce a filament within the substrate; translating the substrate relative to the focused laser beam to irradiate the substrate and produce an additional filament at one or more additional locations; wherein the filaments comprise an array defining an internally scribed path for cleaving the substrate. The method preferably includes the step of cleaving the substrate.
