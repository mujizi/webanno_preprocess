Various manufacturing methods of CdS/CdTe compound semiconductor solar cells comprised of the films of cadmium sulfide (CdS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) have been reported. A practical method of manufacturing the solar cells in which the entire film forming processes are carried out by printing and sintering has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 56-28386.
Traditionally, the printing and sintering method and the chemical bath deposition method have been well known in the formation of CdS films. In the process of the conventional printing and sintering method, a paste is produced by mixing and kneading fine particles of CdS, with a powder of cadmium chloride (CdCl.sub.2), acting as a flux or sintering agent, and propyleneglycol (PC) acting as a dispersive medium. This paste is then coated on a substrate in the form of a film by a screen printing method, dried, and sintered.
This method is highly advantageous because of the relatively low cost of its manufacturing equipment, excellent reproducibility, and the ability to continuously produce CdS layers having a relatively large area and having a desired shape and size. However, it is necessary to use a substrate having a high heat resistance and chemical stability, such as a ceramic sheet of alumina or a barium borosilicate glass, because of the required high sintering temperature of about 700.degree. C.
Moreover, the method is definitely disadvantageous for mass production since the sintering has to be performed in an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen gas, and the coated substrate has to be processed within an expensive ceramic case in order to suppress the evaporation of CdCl.sub.2 within the CdS paste, and the sintering period required is often greater than 2 hours.
Furthermore, the sintered CdS layer is a thick film having an uneven thickness in the range of 20-60 .mu.m and a number of void spaces or pinholes. This layer can hardly be considered a homogeneous layer, and the adhesion strength between the CdS layer and the substrate is not adequate. In addition, a high photoelectric conversion efficiency cannot be obtained from a photoelectric conversion device or a solar cell made of a thick CdS layer because of low light transmittance.
