A better understanding of the present invention and of its many advantages will be had by referring to the following specific examples, given by way of illustration.
EXAMPLE 1
171 g of (C.sub.8 H.sub.17).sub.3 Al.(C.sub.4 H.sub.9).sub.2 O (corresponding to 0.33 mol of tri-n-octyl aluminum) are added with stirring and cooling at 40.degree. C. to 260.5 g (1 mol) of SnCl.sub.4 in a one liter three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, Claisen attachment, thermometer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel. After addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes at 40.degree. C. and then, 260 g (2 mols) of di-n-butyl ether are added, again with stirring and cooling to 40.degree. - 50.degree. C. After conclusion of this addition, the mixture is stirred for a further 15 minutes without heating or cooling and is poured with cooling into 200 ml of ice water. In this process, the temperature is kept at 50.degree. -70.degree. C. at most. After phase separation, the di-n-butyl ether is distilled from the ether phase under reduced pressure and the C.sub.8 H.sub.17 SnCl.sub.3 is obtained as a brightly-colored to dark-brown liquid. The yield is 322 g (90 percent, calculated on the Sn introduced).
Gas chromatographic analysis with a sample reacted with C.sub.2 H.sub.5 MgCl gave a content of C.sub.8 H.sub.17 SnCl.sub.3 of 93 weight percent.
