It is a well known fact that wind power is currently being developed worldwide and especially in European countries such as Germany, Spain and Denmark.
Following more than a decade of considerable technological advances progressing from dozens of kW to today's MW, it became increasingly clear that there was a need to move towards machines with larger diameter blades (from 90 metres at present) and to a greater hub height reaching over one hundred metres. This development requires new technologies, which will enable the viable construction in terms of costs and time of progressively higher towers.
In this process of advancing the State of the Art, the following three inventions by the same holder of the present invention may be cited as reference since they belong to the same scope of the art.
Thus, utility model U200502266 "Mould perfected for the execution of prefabricated concrete elements for the construction of modular towers for wind turbines", is an invention consisting of formwork made from metal, PVC, fibreglass or any other material, required to manufacture elements with complicated geometry and strict tolerances, required in the manufacture of towers within the same scope of application as the present invention. This invention satisfactorily resolves specific problems associated with manufacture, using precast concrete, of elements for the construction of modular towers for wind turbines.
In addition, Utility model U200501400 "Perfected structure of joints between plates of modular towers for wind turbines and other applications" consists of an innovative and original structure for joining the plates which make up the aforementioned towers, supporting the wind turbine electricity generators.
