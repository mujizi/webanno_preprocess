[0062] For example, in formulas V and VI, R.sub.1 can be selected from -Oalkyl or alkyl; and R.sub.2 can be selected from H or alkyl. Adhesion promoters of formulas V and VI, are suited for both liquid phase and gas phase silane deposition methods, regardless of whether the environment is aqueous or anhydrous. Thus, in one aspect, these adhesion promoters do not need to hydrolyze before being able to react with a hydroxyl rich surface. For example, and while not intending to be bound by theory, formulas V or VI may initiate a ring-opening sequence by reacting with surface bound hydroxyl groups immediately on contact to yield the open-chain variants. Further, reactions rates of the adhesion promoters are convenient. As described herein, such surface modifications may be performed in liquid phase, using etchants, oxidizing solutions, volatile solvents and other reactive species. Moreover, this method employing the adhesion promoters disclosed herein affords a homogeneous and smooth deposition of the adhesion promoter, and film thicknesses will depend on the concentration and deposition time of the adhesion promoter.
[0063] In Table 2, examples of each of these individual components, namely substrate, adhesion promoter as described by acid component and amine component, and the polyphosphazene are illustrated. While examples of complete acidic components are provided in Table 2, only examples of the amine portion or a molecule or composition that can constitute the amine component are illustrated, where R can be an alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl, and the like, as understood by one of ordinary skill. Any individual component is interchangeable with any other individual component from within the same modular component type (column). Taken together, Table 2 provides a modular component "library" for substrates, acid components, amine components, and polyphosphazenes.
[0064] In this aspect, for example, this method can be used when combining alkoxysilanes containing one or more haloalkyl groups, and depositing tetramethyl-guanidine or polyethyleneimine. Further, while not intending to be bound by theory, when metals are used as substrates, amino acids such as the above mentioned can be deposited directly due to metal carboxylate formation.
[0065] In a further aspect, strong chemical interactions can be employed in the adhesion promoter interactions, for example, by chemical grafting methods, and the like. For example, dialcohol side chains may be used as part of the adhesion promoter, in which case it may be possible to connect the adhesion layer to the polymer layer by forming ether bonds with the polymer side groups. This aspect would also permit fusing the ends of side chains together, instead of simply pairing them up in the typical fashion. For example, this technique is possible by using a monoprotected alcohol functional groups during substitution, in which case a polyphosphazene as a copolymer that contains a small amount of these functional side groups is obtained. In this case, the protecting groups may be moisture labile.
[0066] Techniques such as these for grafting compounds to a silicone have been described, and the invention disclosed herein is not limited to those procedures. Other examples of surface preparation of silicones prior to grafting the silicone to other compounds can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,756.
