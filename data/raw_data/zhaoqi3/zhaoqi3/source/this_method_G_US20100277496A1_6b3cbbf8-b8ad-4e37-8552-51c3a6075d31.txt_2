[0124] Next, for each piece of photographic image data, the scrolling speed calculation unit 53 refers to the folder information and cluster layer in the file management information DB 32 to acquire "M", the number of clusters at the cluster layer level in the folder selected by the user. The scrolling speed calculation unit 53 divides the total display time "dL/V" by the number of clusters "M", thereby calculating "dL/(VM)=T.sub.A", i.e. the time for scrolling through one cluster (hereinafter "cluster display time").
[0125] Furthermore, the scrolling speed calculation unit 53 performs the following processes for each cluster in the cluster layer level. For each piece of photographic image data, the scrolling speed calculation unit 53 refers to the folder information and cluster layer in the file management information DB 32, thus acquiring "N.sub.A", the number of pieces of photographic image data in a cluster. The scrolling speed calculation unit 53 multiplies the width of thumbnails "d" by "N.sub.A" and divides the result "N.sub.Ad" by the cluster display time T.sub.A. The scrolling speed calculation unit 53 thereby calculates "N.sub.Ad/T.sub.A=V.sub.A", the cluster scrolling speed.
[0126] This method of calculating scrolling speed is only an example, however, and the method is not limited in this way. For example, in the above-described method of calculating scrolling speed, division by the thumbnail width "d" may be omitted.
[0127] An operation signal is input into the display control unit 54 from the operation unit 2 via the I/O interface unit 5 and the bus 9, and the display control unit 54 switches the display screen on the display unit 4 in accordance with the operation signal. For example, when the user selects a folder in the album library 11, the display control unit 54 displays a bold frame around the selected folder, displays thumbnails for the photographic image data in the selected folder in the thumbnail display area 12, and outputs folder information for the folder selected by the user to the scrolling speed calculation unit 53.
[0128] The scrolling direction is also input into the display control unit 54 from the scrolling operation input acquisition unit 51, and the scrolling speed for each cluster is input into the display control unit 54 from the scrolling speed calculation unit 53. While referring to the file management information DB 32, as it reads the photographic image data in the selected folder from the file DB 31, the display control unit 54 scrolls, on the display unit 4, the thumbnail sequence for photographic image data in the selected folder. The thumbnail sequence is scrolled in the scrolling direction and at the scrolling speed for each cluster.
