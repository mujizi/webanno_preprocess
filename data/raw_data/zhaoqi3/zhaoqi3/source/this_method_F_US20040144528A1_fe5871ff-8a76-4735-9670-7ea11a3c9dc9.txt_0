[0089] In this embodiment, mixing valve 34 changes the mixing ratio; however, a converging member, which has a fixed mixing ratio, can be used instead of mixing valve 34. In this case, the heating amount in heat exchanger 10 should be controlled by compressor 2 such that the temperature of hot water spouting agrees with the target temperature in response to a decrease in the hot water stored in tank 83. This structure can reduce the cost because of employing simpler mixing valve 34.
[0090] In this embodiment, heat accumulator 82 is disposed to circulating water path 81; however, path 81 without accumulator 82 can work. In this case, path 81 is placed such that storage temperature detector 51 can detect a temperature of the water circulating in path 81, and the heat retaining operation is carried out for maintaining the circulating water at a given temperature. This structure can omit heat accumulator 82, thereby reducing substantially the cost, although the temperature of the hot water spouting slightly fluctuates.
[0091] In this embodiment, heat pump cycle 7 is driven, thereby heating water flow path 9 of heat exchanger 10, so that natural convection is produced in circulating water path 81 for heating or retaining heat. As such the circulating path is kept hot by the heat pump, and this method results in better efficiency than a method using a heater instead of the heat pump. Further, since the heat pump is driven during the heat retaining operation, the heat pump itself becomes ready quicker. Circulating path 81 can be directly heated by a heater, or storage tank 83 can be directly heated by a heater.
[0092] In regular usage of the water heater, heat pump cycle 7 operates more efficiently at the smaller temperature difference between refrigerant flow path 8 and water flow path 9. Thus a heating amount needed in heat exchanger 10 is reserved in response to a water temperature detected by water temperature detector 21, and a refrigerant flow resistance disposed in decompressor 4 is controlled such that the temperature difference between path 8 and path 9 is minimized. Then a highly efficient operation is achievable.
[0093] According to exemplary embodiments 1-4, tap water is not only heated by the heat exchanger but also heated by the heater, so that the heater can make up for the shortage of heating the tap water by the heat exchanger. The heater does not influence directly to the heat exchanger that controls a temperature of hot water to be spouted, so that better control can be expected. Further, the heat exchange between the refrigerant and the water is carried out by the heat exchanger independently of the heater, so that an efficient heat exchange can be expected. The hot water in the heat accumulator is kept at a given temperature, even if the hot water supply operation is started with the compressor and the heat exchanger been kept cool, the hot water in the heat accumulator heats the water in any one of the water supply pipe, the heat exchanger or the hot water supply circuit, so that the hot water to be spouted always becomes ready quickly. The heat accumulator is kept hot by the heat pump, which results in better efficiency than using a heater instead of the heat pump, and since the heat pump cycle is driven at the start-up, the temperature of the hot water spouting becomes ready quicker. At least one of the water supply pipe, the water flow path or the hot water supply circuit is kept retaining heat, the hot water in the circulating path is spouted when the supply operation starts, so that the temperature of the hot water becomes appropriate quicker. The heat of the water flow path heats the heat exchanger, so that the heat pump cycle becomes ready quicker. The heat accumulator is formed in an optimal size, so that heat dissipation loss due to a bulky accumulator does not increase any more, and there is no worry about preparing a large space or a heavy weight of the accumulator. Further, the temperature of the hot water in the accumulator is set higher than the temperature of the hot water to be spouted, so that a density of heat accumulation can be raised for downsizing the heat accumulation. As a result, a smaller installation space and a lighter weight can be expected. The water to be used for hot water supply can be used as heat accumulating material, so that the water heater can be lighter if the water is drained before the transportation. The water has a specific heat large enough as a heat accumulating mass and can be handled safely.
