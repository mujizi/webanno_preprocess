In Examples 13 and 14, rabbit eye irritation studies were conducted in order to compare the properties of unbuffered, non-isotonic solutions of PVP-I at pH 4 (Example 13) and unbuffered isotonic PVP-I solutions at pH 4 (Example 14) to isotonic solutions of PVP-I buffered to a pH of 5.6 (Comparative Example C; not stable). In the same study, rabbit eye irritation studies were conducted with a saline solution control and two commercially available products, Neosporin.RTM.and Herplex.RTM.. The formulations for Examples 13 and 14, as well as Comparative Example C are set forth in Table 14 below:
The results showed that the unbuffered solutions of Examples 3 and 14 at pH 4 (both isotonic and non isotonic) were non-irritating, as was the buffered solution of Comparative Example C. This result was not expected due to the low pH of the PVP-I solution. Rather, it was expected that only PVP-I solutions above pH 5 would to be non-irritating.
In the same study, a rabbit eye irritation study was conducted with the PVP-I solution of Example 12 (0.6% PVP-I solution; 0.06% available iodine). This solution was also found to be non-irritating.
Finally, in Example 15, a randomized paired comparison comfort evaluation was conducted in 30 normal human volunteers with a solution of stabilized, unbuffered isotonic 0.3% PVP-I having the formulation provided for Example 14, with Garamycin.RTM. ophthalmic solution and Sodium Sulamyd.RTM. ophthalmic solution. The results of this study revealed that there was statistically no significant differences in the discomfort between all three solutions.
The examples provided above are not meant to be exclusive. Many other variations of the present invention would be obvious to those skilled in the art, and are contemplated to be within the scope of the appended claims.
