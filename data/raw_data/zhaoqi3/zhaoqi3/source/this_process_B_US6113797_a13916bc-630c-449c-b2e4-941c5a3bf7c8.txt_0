I have found that the above disadvantages and limitations can be overcome by providing a two-stage membrane process in which the bulk of the water (containing partially or "sparingly soluble" inorganic scale-forming compounds as well as completely soluble inorganic compounds and from which virtually all suspended matter has been separated by suitable means such as chemical coagulation, flocculation, clarification and/or gravity settling followed by multi-media filtration, or by means of prefiltration using microfiltration or ultrafiltration) is purified in an economical manner by the first membrane stage which operates at low pressure. The concentrate from the first membrane stage is purified by using the second membrane stage which is operated at high pressures in order to maximize the overall purified water recovery. In order to prevent formation of scale compounds on the first membrane stage and second membrane stage, the concentrate from the second membrane stage is "softened" by a suitable means in order to remove scale precursors and the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate is split into two streams one is recycled and blended with the influent water stream feeding the first membrane stage and the second is recycled and blended with the concentrate from the first membrane stage, feeding the second membrane stage. The purified water streams (i.e. membrane permeates) from both membrane stages are combined, providing the overall purified product. In a preferred embodiment, the permeate from the second stage is recycled back to the first stage in order to obtain improved product water purity. A very small concentrate stream from the second membrane stage is combined with any precipitated hardness compounds and is "bled" out of the system as a very small reject stream for membrane osmotic pressure control. By using a two-stage membrane process, the cost of the overall process is greatly reduced. Furthermore, by splitting the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate recycle stream in this manner between the two membrane stages, scale formation on either the first membrane stage or the second membrane stage is completely eliminated. These and other objects of this invention will become clear from the specification, claims and drawings appended hereto.
In drawings which illustrate embodiments of the invention, FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of the proposed two-stage high recovery membrane process for the economical purification of large flowrates of water containing low to moderate TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) with moderate to high hardness. In essence, FIG. 1 shows a prefiltration step 2 intended to remove suspended matter by suitable means such as coagulation, flocculation, clarification, multi-media filtration, ultrafiltration or microfiltration. Prefiltration is followed by the first reverse osmosis or nanofiltration stage (RO-1 or NF-1, respectively), 7, where the bulk of the water is purified via stream 14. The concentrate from RO-1, 8, is treated further in the second RO or NF stage, 11 (i.e. RO-2 or NF-2) where the remaining water is purified via stream 15, combining with stream 14 to provide the ultimate purified water, stream 16 and providing only a small aqueous reject stream 13. In order to prevent scale formation in first and second membrane stages, an ion exchange "softening resin" 17 is used to treat the RO-2 or NF-2 concentrate stream 12, providing a "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate stream 18 which is split into two streams 9 and 10 which are recycled and blended with hardness-containing "feed streams" to first stage (i.e. stream 3) and to second stage (i.e. stream 8), respectively.
FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of an enhanced recovery 2-stage single pass membrane process for the economical purification of large volumes of water containing low to moderate TDS and moderate to high hardness where a relatively high water purity is required with a minimum discharge of rejects. In essence, this process is similar to the process depicted in FIG. 1 except for partial recycling of the purified second stage membrane permeate back to the influent side of the first stage membrane via stream 25, thus enabling further purification using the 2-stage single pass membrane system and reducing costs.
FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of yet another enhanced recovery 2-stage double pass membrane process for the economical purification of moderate to large volumes of water containing low to moderately low TDS and moderate to high hardness where very high treated water purity is required (i.e. water electrical receptivity >2 meager Ohms) with a minimum discharge of rejects. In essence, this process is similar to the process depicted in FIG. 2 except for the addition of a second pass membrane system 27 to treat the permeate from the two-stage membrane system. The low-TDS and very low hardness 2nd pass membrane concentrate stream 28 back to the influent side of the first membrane stage, thus providing only a very small overall process reject stream 13 and a very high purity product stream 29 which can be used in the pharmaceutical industry.
FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of yet another enhanced recovery 2-stage double pass membrane process for the economical purification of moderate to large volumes of water containing low to moderate TDS and moderate to high hardness where an extremely high water purity is required (i.e. water electrical resistivity >18 mega ohms) with a minimum discharge of rejects. In essence, this process is similar to the process depicted in FIG. 3 except for the addition of a "mixed bed" ion exchange polishing resin 30 which will remove trace ions from the purified membrane permeate 29, thus providing an extremely high purity water which can be used in the electronics' industry while producing only a very small reject stream 13.
