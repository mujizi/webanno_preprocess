[0024] An autonomous mobile robot normally has at least three wheels to be able to stand stable in an upright position. In a preferred embodiment, two of these wheels are used for driving and the third wheel is used for steering. In another preferred embodiment, the two wheels are moved separately and the third wheel is freely moveable in all direction in a horizontal plane. By rotating the two driving wheels at different speeds or in a remote direction, the robot is steered by those driving wheels. In this case the third wheel must be freely swivelable around a vertical axis. In another embodiment, the third wheel has both a driving and a steering function. In this case the two other wheels are used as tracking and stabilizing wheels. If more wheels are used, it would only result, especially when to ground is not flat, in one of the wheels being out of contact with the ground. If this wheel happens to be one of the driving wheels, the robot can not move correctly. This, of course, can be avoided by having suspended wheels. In another way this problem is avoided by having a horizontal axis functionality between the two pairs of wheels.
[0025] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the robot comprises a cylinder shaped central body carried and is driven on two wheels or just one wheel. In this embodiment, the robot comprises a frame carrying the mechanical interface on a pair of wheels. The frame acts as a wagon to the central body and is attached to the central body by a coupling that allows the frame to swing around an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis through the central body.
[0026] According to the invention, the operation module has no wheels at all or any number of wheels. Most common would be two, three or four wheels. In any of these cases, the combined unit comprising an autonomous mobile robot and an operation module would have more than five wheels. According to the discussion above, this would result in an undefined contact with the ground. If one or more wheels are lifted or suspended on docking, this problem is solved. Then the combined unit would only have three wheels in firm contact with the ground. In one embodiment, the robot and the module are coupled with a coupling that allows rotation around an axis normal to a vertical connection plane between the robot and the module. In this way, four wheels are always in firm contact with the ground.
[0027] In yet another embodiment of the invention the robot has a coupling hatch by which the front end of an operational module is lifted such that only two or preferably no wheels are in firm contact with the ground. In an another preferred embodiment all, all but one or at least all but two wheels of the operation module are freely swivelable in all directions around an axis normal to the horizontal plane. In another preferred embodiment of a combined unit, one or two wheels of the operating module are in firm contact with the ground and thus act as tracking wheels. To accomplish this a pair of freely swivelable wheels on the mobile robot are locked in a longitudinal orientation for tracking when the autonomous mobile robot is uncoupled from an module. In another embodiment, this problem is solved by a raisable and lowerable tracking wheel of a fixed longitudinal orientation which is lowered for tracking when the autonomous mobile robot is not coupled to a wheeled module.
[0028] It is difficult to construct mathematical models for steering an autonomous mobile robot, which is coupled to a wheeled operation module, if the mathematical model must take into consideration the present orientation of the autonomous mobile robot in addition to the orientation of the wheeled operation module. This problem is dealt with by the axle construction. By making the coupling hitch frame pivotable relative to the driven wheel axle, the number and the complexity of the sensors on the autonomous mobile robot is decreased. The term "wheeled" in the claims is also intended to encompass wheeled robots having crawler or caterpillar tracks around the wheels.
