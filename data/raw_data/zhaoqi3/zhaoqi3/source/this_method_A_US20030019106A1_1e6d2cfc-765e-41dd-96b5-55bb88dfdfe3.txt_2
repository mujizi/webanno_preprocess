[0334] WEDM is used to cut superhard parts of various shapes and sizes from larger cylinders or flat pieces. Typically, cutting tips and inserts for machine tools and re-shaping cutters for oil well drilling bits represent the greatest use for WEDM in PDC finishing.
5.) Polishing
[0335] Polishing superhard surfaces to very high tolerances may be accomplished by diamond impregnated high speed polishing machines. The combination of high speed and high friction temperatures tends to burnish a PDC surface finished by this method, while maintaining high degrees of flatness, thereby producing a mirror-like appearance with precise dimensional accuracy.
b. Finishing A Spherical Geometry
[0336] Finishing a spherical surface (concave spherical or convex spherical) presents a greater problem than finishing a flat surface or the rounded edge of a cylinder. The total surface area of a sphere to be finished compared to the total surface area of a round end of a cylinder of like radius is four (4) times greater, resulting in the need to remove four (4) times the amount of polycrystalline diamond compact material. The nature of a spherical surface makes traditional processing techniques such as lapping, grinding and others unusable because they are adapted to flat and cylindrical surfaces. The contact point on a sphere should be point contact that is tangential to the edge of the sphere, resulting in a smaller amount of material removed per unit of time, and a proportional increase in finishing time required. Also, the design and types of processing equipment and tooling required for finishing spherical objects must be more accurate and must function to closer tolerances than those for other shapes. Spherical finishing equipment also requires greater degrees of adjustment for positioning the workpiece and tool ingress and egress.
