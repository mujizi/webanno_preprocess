TABLE-US-00014 [0194] Species: Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) Strain: Crl: (HA) BR Source: Charles River Laboratories Sex: No particular gender is prescribed for this test. If females are used) they will be nulliparous and not pregnant. Body Weight Range: 300-500 grams at identification Age: Young adults Acclimation Period: Minimum 5 days Number of Animals: 15 (per extract) Identification Method: Ear punch
Justification of Test System:
[0195] The Hartley albino guinea pig has been used historically for sensitization studies (Magnusson and Kilgman, 1970). The guinea pig is believed to be the most sensitive animal model for this type of study. The susceptibility of the Hartley strain to a known sensitizing agent, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB) has been substantiated with this method.
Test and Control Article Preparation:
[0196] Fresh extracts will be prepared at each phase of the study as previously indicated (see Test Article). If the test material is suitable for patching, a topical application of the test sample (2 cm.times.2 cm patch) will be used at the challenge. The vehicle used to prepare the extract will be prepared in the same manner as the extract (but without test article) to serve as the control measure.
