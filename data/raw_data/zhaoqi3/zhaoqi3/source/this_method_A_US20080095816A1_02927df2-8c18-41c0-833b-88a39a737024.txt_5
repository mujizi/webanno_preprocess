[0113] In a further aspect, additional steps can be employed in combination with the activation methods and other steps disclosed above for adding a polyphosphazene of the present invention to the silicone-containing substrate. For example, the substrate can be treated with a cleaning agent, such as a chemical cleaning agent, or the substrate can be subjected to another treatment whereby contaminants on the surface or layer of the substrate are removed. These methods can comprise washing the substrate with a chemical agent such as an oxidizing agent, an acidic solution, an alkaline solution, or a reducing agent, that can possibly etch the silicone-containing substrate. A separate drying step optionally can also be employed.
[0114] In further aspects, this disclosure provides methods for making a medical device comprising a polyorganosiloxane in combination with a polyphosphazene of the present invention. This disclosure also provides methods of imparting improving properties to the medical devices by, for example, reducing cell encrustation, reducing the severity of thrombosis, or improving the anti-rejection properties of the medical device. Also provided by this disclosure are methods of imparting antibacterial and/or antithrombogenic properties to a medical device that contains a polyorganosiloxane, the method comprising adding to the polyorganosiloxane or combining with the polyorganosiloxane at least one polyphosphazene of the present invention.
[0115] Referring to FIGS. 1 through 3, a series of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images are shown that illustrate one manner by which the present invention can impart more biocompatible properties to a device. FIGS. 1 through 3 are images of a surface of a Silastic.RTM. Foley catheter that were taken after a 3-day incubation in artificial urine containing E. coli. In FIG. 1 (1600.times.), the Silastic.RTM. Foley catheter was treated with poly[bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)]phosphazene according to this disclosure, and then subjected to the 3-day incubation period. In FIG. 2 (550.times.) and FIG. 3 (1600.times.), the Silastic.RTM. Foley catheter was not treated with any polyphosphazene, and then was subjected to the 3-day incubation period. As these SEM data illustrate, no significant calcification or mineralization of the polyphosphazene-treated Silastic.RTM. catheter was observed at the end of the 3-day incubation period (FIG. 1), whereas the untreated Silastic.RTM. catheters exhibited significant calcification after the 3-day incubation period (FIGS. 2 and 3). Thus, the FIGS. 2 and 3 samples clearly show more crystal formation, where the mineral deposits appear as the needle-shaped material. Therefore, in still another aspect, the present disclosure also provides a method of reducing calcification of a polyorganosiloxane-containing device that has contact with tissue or fluids of the human or animal body or organ, comprising adding a polyphosphazene to the polyorganosiloxane. As described herein, this method also is not limited as to the exact disposition of the polyorganosiloxane and polyphosphazene components, for example, the polyorganosiloxane can be coated with, blended with, mixed with, grafted to, bonded to, layered on, or combined with in any manner.
[0116] In summary, the present disclosure provides methods and devices and related inventions whereby a polyphosphazene is added to a silicone-containing device to provide the device with enhanced and superior properties relative to the device in the absence of the polyphosphazene. In particular, the silicone-polyphosphazene device has enhanced antibacterial properties, antithrombogenic properties, enhanced flow characteristics, enhanced lubricity, enhanced biocompatibility properties, enhanced resistance to degradation, and anti-rejection properties.
[0117] The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly understood that resort can be had to various other aspects, embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description herein, can suggest themselves to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention or the scope of the appended claims.
