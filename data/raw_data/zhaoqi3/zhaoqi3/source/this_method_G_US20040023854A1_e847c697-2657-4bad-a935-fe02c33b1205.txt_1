[0480] Fab' fragments may be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., J. Exp. Med., 175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F (ab')2 molecule. Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted from E. coli and subjected to direct chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody.
[0481] Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers.
[0482] Kostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148 (5): 1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers.
[0483] The "diabody" technology described, for example, by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natal. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connecte to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain.
[0484] Accordingly, the VH and V, domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forcing two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See, Gruber et al., J. Immunol. 152: 5368 (1994).
