[0097] FIG. 24 shows the normal Raman spectra of the some of the primary neurotransmitters, dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and norepinephrine (NE). Most evident are the distinguishing peaks in each of the compounds. When these same compounds are studied with SERS, a significant increase in sensitivity is observed, but similar distinguishing features are found. The detection of NTs using silver electrodes and gold colloids has been demonstrated. See Morris, M. D.; McGlashen, M. L.; Davis, K. L., Surface-enhanced Raman (SERS) probes of neurotransmitters. Proceedings of SPIE--The International Societyfor Optical Engineering 1990, 1201, (Proc. Opt. Fibers Med. 5, 1990), 447-50; Kneipp, K.; Wang, Y.; Dasari, R. R.; Feld, M. S., Near-infrared Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (NIR-SERS) of Neurotransmitters in Colloidal Silver Solutions. Spectrochimica Acta 1995, 51A, (3), 481-487. However, a problem when using electrode surfaces is that they can foul up easily and provide irreproducible results. Gold colloids constituted an advance toward an effective assay, but detection levels were above metabolic levels in the dialysate from rat brains.
[0098] According to one aspect of the present invention, an experimental approach uses designer coatings that have chemical specificity toward neurotransmitters. The coatings are designed with two reactive sites: one for the neurotransmitter and the other specific to a spectral enhancement particle surface. This technique has the advantages of selectivity due to the reactivity of the coating and the structural specificity of Raman spectroscopy; and high sensitivity due to the concentration of neurotransmitters at the spectral enhancement particle surface and the strong amplification of Raman scattering at spectral enhancement particle surfaces arising from the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) effect.
[0099] The present invention uses the properties of the paramagnetic particles to separate the desired neurotransmitter adducts on silver spectral enhancement particles from the complex matrices that are dealt with in pharmacological research involving the detection of serotonin during the study of atypical antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and haloperidol. The chemical structure of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine all have a common chemical feature; they all contain electron-rich sites on their aromatic rings. This makes these compounds susceptible to reaction with diazoniums to form azo adducts. Azo compounds make up a large number of popular dyes. The azo bridge contains n-.pi.* electronic transitions that provide moderate resonance Raman scattering. The silver spectral enhancement particle provides an enhancement of approximately a factor of 10.sup.7. The combination of enhancements produces subnanomolar detection limits. Moreover, this process is extremely rapid (approximately 30 seconds) whereas the standard method of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and electrochemical detection takes much longer. The HPLC method alone requires approximately 30 minutes per assay.
[0100] The physical properties and synthetic methods for creating nanoscale paramagnetic particles are well established. The small paramagnetic particles have found wide application as separation facilitators in techniques such as immunoassays and a wide variety of biomedical applications. Paramagnetic particles are composed of materials with an unpaired electron. For example, Fe.sup.3+ ions have 5 unpaired electrons. This has a very strong paramagnetic reaction to a magnetic field. In general, assay material that reacts positively with a magnetic field and has a small susceptibility with a field is termed paramagnetic.
[0101] Silver particles can be kept at a very low concentration to keep the surface coverage of tethered serotonin high. The coupling of the silver particles with paramagnetic particles permits a dilute solution of SERS active particles to be concentrated. This makes it possible to detect several orders of magnitude lower concentration of neurotransmitters than with the existing method. It has been shown that with a decrease of coverage there is an increase in the SERS enhancement. In addition, the presence of excess silver nanoparticles that do not have analyte attached to the surface can adsorb and/or scatter the Raman photons. Selectively attaching analytes to the surface of silver nanoparticles allows for a high surface coverage at low analyte concentrations. Finally, the concentration of particles from a dilution solution/matrix will also allow for removing the SERS active portion of the assay from interferences such as ECF proteins. The chemical process of the present invention creates a neurotransmitter adduct that produces an additional resonant Raman enhancement of as much as an additional thousandfold improvement in sensitivity. Brownian motion of the nanoparticles mimics agitation and naturally mixes the reagents throughout the sample. This combination of enhancements and comprehensive sample measurement has led to subnanomolar detection limits.
