[0002] The invention relates to a method and reactor for applying a coating to a fiber by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Also, the invention relates to an article comprising a multiplicity of fiber tows.
[0003] Fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are formed of continuous uniaxial or woven fibers of ceramic material embedded in a ceramic matrix. These materials are designed to have a relatively weak fiber-matrix bond strength compared to the matrix strength so as to increase overall composite strength and toughness. When the CMC is loaded above a stress that initiates cracks in the matrix, the fibers debond from the matrix allowing fiber/matrix sliding without fiber fracture. The fibers can then bridge a matrix crack and transfer load to the surrounding matrix by transferring tensile stresses to frictional interfacial shear forces. The fiber reinforced CMCs have great potential for use in aircraft and gas turbine engines due to their excellent properties at high temperatures.
[0004] The CMCs can be manufactured by filament winding. In this process, fibers, usually in the form of long fiber tows, are saturated with a slurry of matrix powder in suitable solvents and binders and are then wound onto a mandrel to form cylinders or sheets of matrix containing aligned fibers. The impregnated shapes made therefrom are at this stage of the process commonly termed "prepregs." A prepreg can be reshaped as desired and ultimately formed into a preform for a composite article. The preform is subjected to a burn-out step to remove organic or other fugitive coating components. The preform is finally consolidated into a dense composite material by reaction with molten silicon at high temperature.
[0005] The fibers are coated for several purposes such as to protect them during composite processing, to modify fiber-matrix interface strength and to promote or prevent mechanical and/or chemical bonding of the fiber and matrix. A number of different techniques have been developed for applying fiber coatings, such as slurry-dipping, sol-gel, sputtering and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Of these, CVD has been most successful in producing impervious coatings of uniform thickness and controlled composition. In a typical CVD process, fibers and reactants are heated to some elevated temperature where coating precursors decompose and deposit as a coating. CVD coatings can be applied either in a batch or continuous mode. In a batch mode, a length of fiber is introduced into a reactor and kept stationary throughout the coating process while reactants are passed through the reactor. In a continuous process, fibers and coating precursors are continuously passed through a reactor. Continuous fiber coating processes are preferred for composites processed by filament winding.
[0006] One common continuous fiber coating process involves running a single tow or fiber into the reactor at a time. The coating is conducted at low pressure to insure uniform coating. The tow or fiber is transported through the reactor only at a slow speed. Although current processes provide useful results, there remains a need for further improvements to CVD processes for uniformly coating fiber tows with higher productivity.
