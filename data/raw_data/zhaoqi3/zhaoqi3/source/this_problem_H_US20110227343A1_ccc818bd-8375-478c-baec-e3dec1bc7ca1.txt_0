Technical Problem
[0011] However, as shown by the relationship between the wind speed and the output power of the wind turbine generator of FIG. 7B, when the wind speed is high, part of the wind energy is fended off more in the acoustic-noise suppression operation shown by the line B (dashed line) than in the normal operation shown by the line A (solid line); therefore, the output power with respect to the wind speed is reduced more in the acoustic-noise suppression operation shown by the line B. Thus, when the wind turbine generator is connected to a utility grid, the wind turbine generator cannot produce output power that meets the output power demanded from the utility grid, in some cases.
[0012] The present invention has been made in view of this problem, and an object thereof is to provide a wind power plant and a wind-power-plant control method, capable of controlling electric power so as to meet the demand from the utility grid while an operation of suppressing the occurrence of acoustic noise is performed for the wind turbine generator.
