[0100] As shown in FIG. 15, slip stream 805 may be sent to dewatering module 840 to further concentrate the adsorbent and contaminant. For example, stream 805 may enter a dead-ended ceramic membrane oriented in a vertical position to concentrate the TiO.sub.2 and Cr.sup.3 slurry by another order of magnitude.
[0101] As the TiO.sub.2--Cr.sup.3 slurry gets pumped into the dead end membrane, the TiO.sub.2--Cr.sup.3 is filtered, and the filtered water is sent to discharge 806. Inside the membrane housing, the combination of gravity and air shock waves make the TiO.sub.2--Cr.sup.3 solids drop down into a collection weir located immediately below the membrane. This process concentrates the TiO.sub.2--Cr.sup.3, and it also keeps the TiO.sub.2--Cr.sup.3 from filling or plugging inside the ceramic membrane channels, keeping them free. The free channels may provide consistent flux in the membrane(s), unlike most dead-end filters which accumulate the solids inside the filter itself (and thus flux continuously reduces). FIG. 17 illustrates a weir in which the TiO.sub.2 has dropped out after dead end filtration.
[0102] Once the weir is nearly full of TiO.sub.2--Cr.sup.3, a valve may be opened and the mixture 807 may pass into dewater/mixer tank 845, which may be configured to perform one or more functions. For example, dewater/mixer tank 845 may be configured to further dewater mixture 807. It may include dewatering membranes in some embodiments. Compressed air 817 from tank 836 may be used to push the TiO.sub.2--Cr.sup.3 slurry into the dewatering membranes. The pressure pushes the water through the membranes and the treated water is sent to the discharge 810, while the dewatered TiO.sub.2--Cr.sup.3 slurry is retained for further processing. Dewater/mixer tank 845 may be configured, according to some embodiments, to add acid 808 from acid storage tank 850 to desorb contaminant (e.g., Cr.sup.3) from adsorbent (e.g., TiO.sub.2), according to some embodiments. For example, a volume of heated (e.g., .about.40 to .about.60.degree. C.) sulfuric acid (e.g., .about.1 wt. %-.about.5 wt. %), may be added to dewater/mixer tank 845 where it may mix with dewatered Cr.sup.3--TiO.sub.2. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to avoid using a pump to move heated acid into dewater/mixer tank 845. Instead, it may be desirable to use compressed air 817 to push acid 808 into dewater/mixer tank 845. Once the acid is added, compressed air 817 is sent up through the bottom of dewater/mixer tank 845. The internal design of dewater/mixer tank 845 may be arranged to create small bubbles of air which flow up through the acid TiO.sub.2--Cr.sup.3 mixture, providing significant mixing required to strip off the Cr.sup.3 from the TiO.sub.2. The heated acid and agitation transfers the Cr.sup.3 from the TiO.sub.2 into the acid mixture. Tests show that this process may take about 20 to about 30 minutes. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to maintain the contents of acid storage tank 850 at constant free acid concentration (i.e., pH). In such cases, make-up acid 814 from make-up tank 849 may be added to tank 850.
[0103] Fluid mixture 809 may pass from dewater/mixer tank 845 into acid storage tank 850. Fluid mixture 809 may comprise or consist of acid (e.g., sulfuric acid) and contaminant (e.g., dissolved trivalent chromium). Compressed air 817 from tank 836 may be used to push fluid mixture 809 into acid storage tank 850.
[0104] The remaining TiO.sub.2 in dewater/mixer tank 845 may be expected to have some acid with dissolved Cr.sup.3 in it. In some embodiments, the acid and dissolved Cr.sup.3 must be flushed out of the TiO.sub.2 before the TiO.sub.2 can be sent to reservoir 821. In these embodiments, the concentration of Cr.sup.3 entrained in the TiO.sub.2 mixture will be too high if this flush is not performed. Eventually the mass of contaminant (e.g., Cr.sup.3) going back to reservoir 821 (and eventually back to photocatalytic reactor 825) will cause the total contaminant (e.g., chromium) concentration to exceed the desired threshold concentration (e.g., <20 ppb chromium). (During pilot experiments, dissolved Cr.sup.3 in the feed water was not observed to adsorb onto the TiO.sub.2. Instead, it only seemed to adsorb after Cr.sup.6 reduction). A volume of treated water 810 is sent into dewater/mixer tank 845 and it is then pushed through the membrane (e.g., like stream 807 above) and placed in rinse water tank 855 via stream 812. Stream 812 may have a low pH (e.g., .about.0.5 to .about.3.0) and comprise dissolved Cr.sup.3.
