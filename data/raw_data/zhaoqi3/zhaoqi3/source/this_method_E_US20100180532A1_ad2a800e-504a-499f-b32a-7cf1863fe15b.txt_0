[0049] It should be appreciated that the turning over step and the positioning step may be merged into a single motion, for instance, by simultaneously rotating the plank 23c proximate to the reference plank 23b, thereby causing the protruding end 6 of the fasteners 1d to pivot under the reference plank 23b rather than slide, and pressing the plank 23c toward the reference plank 23b so that the plank 1c is firmly held in the desired position. In either arrangement, the far edge of the second plank 23c faces (or "confronts") the near edge of the reference plank 23b, creating the desired aesthetic of the decking structure.
[0050] Additional planks 23 are installed in the decking structure 20 by repeating the fastener attachments and plank installing steps until the entire working surface of the decking structure 20 is complete.
[0051] Referring to FIGS. 11-16, a method for assembling a decking structure having planks angled at a predetermined angle to the joists and utilizing the hidden fasteners 1 is shown. For exemplary purposes, this method will be described in relation to a decking structuring having planks angled at 45 degrees to the joists, however, it should be appreciated that the method is also applicable to other predetermined angle designs.
[0052] A base structure is provided using known techniques and methods as mentioned above. In general, the base structure comprises horizontal support beams, including the parallel joists 21 connected at their ends with transverse ledger boards 22 to establish a support surface for the planks.
[0053] Referring to FIG. 11, an initial hidden fastener 1e is affixed to the top surface at the junction of the outermost joist 21 and the ledger board 22. The initial hidden fastener 1e is preferably affixed such that the bottom surface 4 of the initial hidden fastener 1e faces upward and the tabs 10 are aligned with the inside edge of the outermost joist 21 or the ledger board 22. The initial hidden fastener 1e is secured by inserting a screw 24 downward through the first hole 8 into the joist 21 or the ledger board 22.
