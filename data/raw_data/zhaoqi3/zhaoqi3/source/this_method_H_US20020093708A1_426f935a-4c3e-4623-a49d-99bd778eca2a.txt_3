[0009] Furthermore, the present invention provides the possibility of implementing a bidirectional interleaved channel arrangement without band filters. This is important for 40 Gb/s data rates because band filters may have transmission problems with these data rates which can have a persistent adverse effect on the 40 Gb/s signal.
[0010] In accordance with the inventive ideas described above, the inventors are proposing a method for frequency band-dependent distribution and frequency band-dependent influencing of data signals of a WDM system having a multiplicity of channels which propagate in a bidirectional interleaved fashion and which have at least one frequency band between a first side and a second side, which method directs all the data signals of the channels of a specific frequency band, coming from the first side and second side, in the same direction via a single branch (I or/and II) which is assigned to the frequency band and has at least one influencing part, all the data signals being subsequently forwarded between the first and second sides in accordance with their original propagation direction.
[0011] This method reduces the number of required influencing parts to half the influencing parts required in the prior art.
[0012] The influencing parts can be used, for example, to amplify the intensity of the data signals and/or compensate for the dispersion of a frequency band.
[0013] According to the present invention, the distribution of the data signals can be carried out using at least one interleaver with at least four inputs/outputs.
