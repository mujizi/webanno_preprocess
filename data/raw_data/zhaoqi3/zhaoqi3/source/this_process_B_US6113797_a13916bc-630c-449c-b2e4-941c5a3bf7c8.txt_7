And yet another embodiment of this invention is represented in FIG. 5 which depicts an economical high recovery two-stage membrane process similar to the one represented in FIG. 1 except in this case the second stage membrane concentrate 12 is "softened" by using a well-mixed "Chemical Precipitation Tank" 19. The Chemical Precipitation Tank must be of a sufficiently long "residence time", in the range 5 minutes-150 minutes and preferably in the range 15-30 minutes, wherein the sparingly soluble compounds, specifically hardness compounds and silica, are precipitated out of solution. Precipitation of these compounds will be effected by raising the pH of the concentrate stream 12 to a value in the range 9-12 and preferably to 10.5-11 by using a mixture of sodium carbonate (i.e. soda ash) and sodium hydroxide (i.e. caustic soda). This will ensure efficient precipitation of the calcium associated with bicarbonate, sulfate and chloride as calcium carbonate and precipitation of magnesium as magnesium hydroxide and of silica as magnesium silicate. This reaction step will also bring about precipitation and CO-precipitation of other sparingly soluble compounds such as aluminum and ferric hydroxides, barium sulfate and carbonate, calcium fluoride, etc., thus drastically reducing the scale potential of the membrane concentrate stream 12. Other precipitation reagents such as sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide or combinations thereof may also be used for the chemical precipitation step. Once the scale-forming compounds have been precipitated, the mixture 20 containing both soluble and suspended solids is admitted into a "gravity settling tank" 21 with a conical bottom with appropriate hydraulic retention time of 5-60 minutes and more preferably 10-20 minute wherein the bulk solids are settled and discharged as a reject stream 13 containing approximately 2% w/v as Total Suspended Solids (TSS) through the bottom of the tank. Alternatively a "conventional chemically-assisted clarifier" may also be used for bulk suspended solids' separation. The clarified supernatant from the settling tank 21 will contain a relatively low concentration of suspended solids on the order of 100-200 mg/L. This stream is neutralized by reducing the pH to approximately 6-8 using an appropriate inorganic acid 22 (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, etc.), in order to "freeze" the precipitation reactions, and then filtered through an efficient filtration means 23 in order to remove all remaining suspended solids via reject stream 24 thereby providing a "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate stream 18 which is split into two streams 9 and 10 for recycle to the first stage and second stage membrane systems, respectively, as described earlier. This "softened" and "suspended solids' free" recycle stream 18 allows operation of the first stage membrane system at relatively high recoveries in the range 67%-95% and more preferably 80-95%, as well as providing very high overall process purified water recoveries in the range 95%-99.9% without the risk of fouling due to suspended solids or scaling due to hardness metals and silica. The filtration means 23 can be any suitable configuration of cross-flow microfiltration membrane, ultrafiltration membrane or nanofiltration membrane or more simply it can be a "dead end" filtration device such as a single media or multi-media filter, with or without chemical coagulation and flocculation, to be followed by a polishing filter such as a 5-10 micron cartridge filter or back-washable cloth-type filter. A small membrane reject stream 13 is removed from the system in order to control the concentration of soluble inorganic compounds and hence the osmotic pressure.
Yet another embodiment of this invention is represented in FIG. 6 which illustrates another high recovery two-stage process for the economical purification of "high flow" streams containing low to moderate TDS and moderate to high hardness (e.g. 100-2000 mg/L) where it is required to produce a relatively high quality of purified water while minimizing the reject volume. As shown in FIG. 6, this process is identical to the embodiment of the invention represented in FIG. 5 since the second stage membrane concentrate 12 is "softened" via chemical precipitation, solids' clarification, filtration and recycling of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate to the two membrane stages. In this case, however, a large fraction of the second stage permeate 25 is recycled back to the high pressure side of the first stage membrane system, thus effecting overall improvement of permeate quality (stream 16). This will obviate the need to install an independent "second pass" membrane system on the permeate from the two stage process and reduce the capital and operating cost of the process. Thus in accordance with this embodiment, 10%-100% and more preferably 90%-100% of the second stage permeate is recycled to the first stage to effect further water purification in an economical manner.
Yet another embodiment of this invention is represented in FIG. 7 which illustrates another high recovery two-stage process for the economical purification of "high flow" streams containing low to moderate TDS and moderate to high hardness (e.g. 100-2000 mg/L) where it is required to produce a very high quality of purified water while minimizing the reject volume. As shown in FIG. 7, this process is similar to the embodiment of the invention represented in FIG. 6 since the second stage membrane concentrate 12 is "softened" via chemical precipitation, solids' clarification, filtration and recycling of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate to the two membrane stages, as well as recycling a large fraction of the second stage permeate 25 to the high pressure side of the first stage membrane system to improve purified water quality in an economical manner. In order to meet the very high purity water requirement of the pharmaceutical industry, this embodiment of the invention represented in FIG. 7 deploys a second pass semi-permeable membrane purification step 27 which could be reverse osmosis membrane or "tight" nanofiltration membrane to be applied to the combined permeate 16 from the two membrane stages 7 and 11. In this manner, this embodiment of the invention will provide a purified permeate stream 29 with an electrical resistivity >2 mega ohms (i.e. electrical conductivity <0.5 micro Siemen/cm) at the high overall system recoveries of 95%-99.9%. In order to minimize the reject stream volume, the second pass membrane concentrate 28 which contains relatively low TDS and very low hardness is recycled back to the high pressure side of the first stage membrane system, thereby reusing the second pass concentrate and providing only one small "high TDS" "high hardness" reject stream 13 in order to control the system's TDS and osmotic pressure.
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is represented in FIG. 8 which illustrates another high recovery two-stage double pass process for the economical purification of water containing "low to moderate" TDS and hardness where it is desired to achieve an extremely high permeate quality while minimizing the reject volume. In this embodiment, the very high purity permeate 29 obtained from the second pass membrane system 27 as per the embodiment of FIG. 7 is treated further with a mixed bed ion exchange "polishing" unit 30 in order to further reduce the electrical conductivity of the purified water 31 and increase its resistivity to >18 mega ohms, the quality required by the electronics industry in the manufacture of semiconductor wafers. By using the above-described two-stage membrane process, this embodiment of the invention therefore produces extremely high quality water without the attendant problems of scaling and loss of useful life of the membrane and without the production of a large reject waste volume which represents a disposal problem as well as a substantial operating cost. As before, a small membrane reject stream 13 is removed from the system in order to control the concentration of soluble inorganic compounds (i.e. TDS) and hence the osmotic pressure.
