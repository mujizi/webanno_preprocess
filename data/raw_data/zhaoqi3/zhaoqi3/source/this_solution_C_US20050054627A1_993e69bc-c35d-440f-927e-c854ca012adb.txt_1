[0520] Preparation A1, Step 2: A sample of (1R,6S)-6-benzyloxycarbonylamin-o-cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid methyl ester (91.4 g) was dissolved in MeOH (500 mL) prior to the dropwise addition of NaOH (25.3 g) in water (95 mL). After 3 h, the solution was partially concentrated and an Et.sub.2O/water mixture was added. The aqueous layer was separated and was acidified (pH.about.2) with concentrated HCl. The resulting mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were washed with water and brine before they were dried, filtered, and concentrated to give (1R,6S)-6-benzyloxycarbonylamino-cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid (72.7 g). MS found: (M+H).sup.+=276.2.
[0521] Preparation A1, Step 3: A sample of (1R,6S)-6-benzyloxycarbonylamin-o-cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid (72 g) was dissolved in CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 (750 mL) prior to the addition of CDI (50.9 g). After 2.5 h water was added, and the solution was extracted with CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2. The combined organic layers were dried, filtered, and concentrated. The resulting material was dissolved in CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 and ammonia gas was bubbled through the solution for 1.5 h. After stirring overnight, the majority of the solvent was removed and Et.sub.2O was added. The product precipitated as a white solid and was collected to give (1R,6S)-6-carbamoyl-cyclohex-3--enyl)-carbamic acid benzyl ester (61.5 g). MS found: (M+H).sup.+=275.3.
[0522] Preparation A1, Step 4: A sample of (1R,6S)-6-carbamoyl-cyclohex-3--enyl)-carbamic acid benzyl ester (30.7 g) was dissolved in THF (1100 mL) and NMP (220 mL). At -78.degree. C., 2.3M n-BuLi (96.3 mL) was added dropwise. After 2 h, a solution of Boc.sub.2O (24.4 g) in THF (40 mL) was added dropwise. This solution was stirred 1.2 h before it was quenched with a saturated NH.sub.4Cl solution. Water and Et.sub.2O were added. The organic layer was filtered then washed with water, brine, dried, filtered, and concentrated. Flash chromatography of the resulting residue gave (1R,6S)-(6-tert-butoxycarbonylaminocarbonyl-cyclohex-3-enyl)-carbami-c acid benzyl ester (29.2 g). MS found: (M+Na).sup.+=397.4.
[0523] Preparation A1, Step 5: A sample of (1R,6S)-(6-tert-butoxycarbonyl--aminocarbonyl-cyclohex-3-enyl)-carbamic acid benzyl ester (29.0 g) was dissolved in THF (1290 mL). This was cooled in an ice/brine bath prior to the addition of n-BuLi (1.5 mL, 2.4M). After 30 min, iodine (59.0 g) was added in a single portion. The bath was removed, and the reaction was warmed to rt overnight. The resulting solution was quenched with saturated thiosulfate solution. Water and EtOAc were added. The organic layer was washed with water, brine, dried, filtered, and concentrated. The resulting slurry was diluted with Et.sub.2O and (1R,2S,4S,5R)-2-benzyloxycarbonylamino-4-iodo-7-oxo-6-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]o-ctane-6-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (22.8 g) was collected by vacuum filtration. MS found: (M-C.sub.5H.sub.8O.sub.2+H).sup.+=401.1.
[0524] Preparation A1, Step 6: A sample of (1R,2S,4S,5R)-2-benzyloxycarbon-ylamino-4-iodo-7-oxo-6-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane-6-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (43.3 g) was dissolved in benzene (580 mL) prior to the addition of Bu.sub.3SnH (27.8 g) and AIBN (0.7 g). The resulting mixture was warmed to a gentle reflux for 3 h. After cooling, the solvent was removed and hexane was added. The resulting white solid was collected by vacuum filtration to give the title compound, (1R,2S,5R)-2-Benzyloxycarbo-nylamino-7-oxo-6-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane-6-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (29.5 g). MS found: (M+Na).sup.+=397.4.
