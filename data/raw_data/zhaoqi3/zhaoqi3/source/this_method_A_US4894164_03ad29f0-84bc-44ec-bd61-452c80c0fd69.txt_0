To replace at least the functions necessary for maintaining life, the blood must be freed from uremic toxins, the electrolyte metabolism and the acid-base balance maintained and part of the fluid amount absorbed through foodstuff and beverages removed.
This is mainly done with the method of hemodialysis in which blood in an extracorporeal circuit is led past a semipermeable membrane, past the other side of which a dialysis solution is conducted whose electrolyte composition is substantially equal to that of the blood. When this is done the uremic toxins pass from the blood into the dialysis solution and an equalization of the concentrations results. If a pressure difference is established between the blood and the dialysis solution a passage of fluid will also take place, i.e. of ultrafiltrate, and thus the desired fluid withdrawal. Due to the semipermeable properties of the membrane the vital blood corpuscles and proteins are retained in the blood.
In another known method, that is hemofiltration, blood is conducted in an extracorporeal circuit through a hemofilter by which an ultrafiltrate is withdrawn containing the uremic toxins. At the same time, in a first nutrient an equal quantity of a uremic-toxin-free substitution solution is again added in proportion to the blood. In the exchange element used in this method, which may be a dialyzer or a hemofilter, an exchange thus takes place of fluid components to another fluid or a fluid flows along another fluid, for example blood plasma along dialysis solution. Since these fluids or solutions have different temperatures a temperature or heat exchange also takes place.
In DE-OS 3,313,421 such hemodialysis and hemofiltration apparatuses are described. In these known apparatuses the dialysis solution source or substituate source is heated to a predetermined temperature with a temperature regulating unit, the temperature of the source being passed from a temperature detector to a control unit which controls the heating means in accordance with said measured temperature value and a predetermined temperature value. The predetermined temperature value is entered by the attending physician prior to the dialysis session and thereafter kept constant during the entire treatment.
In an article by Q. Maggiore et al. in Proc. EDTA (1981) Vol. 18, p. 597-602, it is shown that the frequently observed and to this date generally accepted better blood pressure stability in the method of insulated ultrafiltration is due to the fact that in this method thermal energy is withdrawn from the blood of the patient. In particular, it has been found that during conventional hemodialysis as well a better blood pressure stability is achieved if the temperature of the dialysis solution is lowered from the usual value of 37.degree. C. to 34.degree. C. It was however also observed that many patients found this temperature drop unpleasant.
