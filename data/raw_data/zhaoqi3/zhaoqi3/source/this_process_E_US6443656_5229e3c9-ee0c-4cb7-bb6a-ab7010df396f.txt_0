FIG. 17 shows the next step in the trench forming process according to one embodiment of the present invention, wherein the elongated form body 12 is removed from the formed and hardened trench. More particularly, the form 12 is removed by inserting a digging bar or the like at defined places along the form and lifting or prying the form out of the formed trench. While the form 12 may or may not be destroyed during the removal process, the resulting trench defines surfaces similar to the bottom surface 12B and opposed side surfaces 12C of the form.
FIGS. 18-20 show more steps according to one advantageous embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, FIG. 18 shows how a grate 53 may be placed upon the support surfaces 41 defined by the elongated members 14. In a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the grate 53 and the height of the upstanding portion 40 of the elongated members 14 are approximately equal. Thus, by aligning the uppermost portion of the opposing elongated members 14 with the upper surface of the slab 47 of trench forming composition poured about the form assembly 10, the upper surface 54 of the grate 53 lies flush with the surrounding ground or surface defined by the slab 47.
Further, when the grate 53 is properly positioned on the support surfaces 41 of the elongated members 14, the hooks 51 are proximate openings defined by the elongated member. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the hooks are insured to be proximate openings defined by the elongated member by aligning the openings 57 defined by the grate with corresponding openings defined by the elongated member and preferably the sleeve member 30. A removable pin 24 can then be inserted into each opening to retain the grate. In order to assist in the positioning of the grate sections and to secure retention of the grate sections to the frame, however, the frame assembly can, but need not necessarily, include a plurality of fixed pins extending inwardly from respective elongated members in an alternating fashion with the openings defined by the elongated members along the length of the elongated members. As described above, a fixed pin is longitudinally spaced from the neighboring openings by a length that equals or slightly exceeds the length of a grate section. In order to install the grate, the end wall of a grate section can be abutted against a pair of fixed pins, one of which extends inwardly from each of the elongated members. As such, the fixed pins can be engaged by corresponding hooks 51 of the grate such as by being positioned within respective openings, i.e., grooves, defined by one end wall of the grate section. As illustrated by FIG. 18, the grate section is then laid upon the support surfaces of the elongated members such that the hooks of the other end of the grate section are proximate corresponding openings defined by the elongated members. In the illustrated embodiment, the grate section and, in turn, the hooks carried by the other end of the grate section are positioned relative to the openings defined by the elongated members by aligning the openings, i.e., grooves, defined by the other end of the grate section with corresponding openings defined by the elongated members and the sleeve members mounted thereto. By repeating this process for each grate section, complete openings will be formed by the alignment of the grooves defined by the end walls of adjacent grate sections with fixed pins extending through every second opening and the remainder of the complete openings being aligned with corresponding openings defined by the elongated members. As shown in FIGS. 19 and 20, pins 24 are then slidably inserted into the remainder of the openings such that the mechanical engagement of the hooks 51 and the pins secure the grate 53 to the trench. Advantageously, no tools are needed to insert the pin 24 in order to facilitate installation and removal of the grate.
The spatial arrangement of fixed and removable pins is slightly greater than the length of the grate sections to accommodate differences in the thermal expansion and contraction of the grate sections 58, 60 and the cementitious material forming the trench. In this regard, the assembly is preferably designed so that the fixed and removable pins continue to secure the grate sections to the elongated members 14 of the frame 13 as the grate sections and the cementitious material differentially expand and contract without the pins ever becoming tightly bound within a respective opening. Thus, the pins can continue to be inserted and removed as the temperature changes. Preferably, the spatial arrangement of the fixed and removable pins is selected such that at the coldest temperatures at which the differential contraction between the grate sections and the cementitious material forming the trench is the greatest, the gap between the ends of adjacent grate sections is still less than the diameter of both the fixed pins and the removable pins such that the grate sections will continue to be securely retained to the frame. Moreover, at the hottest temperatures at which the differential expansion between the grate sections and the cementitious material forming the trench is the greatest, the spatial arrangement of the fixed and removable pins is selected such that the grate will not lock the removable pins in place or shear either the fixed or removable pins.
In the case wherein a full size grate section is proximate the end of the trench, an end rail 63 as shown in FIGS. 6-8 extends between the elongated members. As described above, the end rail has an upstanding wall that is substantially perpendicular to the upper surface 54 of the grate 53 and defines a pair of corresponding grooves 67 extending through the side walls 65 and surface 66. Thus, the grooves 59 and 67 of the grate section 58 and end rail 63, respectively, will align to define a complete opening for slidably receiving pins 24 in the same manner as described above in conjunction with a pair of adjacent grate sections. If, on the other hand, the endmost grate section 58 must be cut to size, the end wall of the grate will, in all likelihood, not define a groove 59. However, the end 56 of the grate section is preferably cut at an obtuse angle relative to the upper surface thereof. Thus, the end rail of FIGS. 9-11 can extend between the elongated members for engaging the cut end of the grate section. In this regard, the upstanding wall 64 and upper surface 54 of the grate 53 define a complementary acute angle. Thus, the angled upstanding wall engages the cut end of the grate section to prevent the grate section from being inadvertently removed. Also, because of the complementary acute angle defined by the end rail 63, the cut end 56 of the grate section must be inserted and engaged by the end rail before securing the opposite end of the grate section to the elongated members. Thus, a slidably removable pin 24 is preferably used instead of a fixed pin 45 to engage the opposite end of the grate section.
