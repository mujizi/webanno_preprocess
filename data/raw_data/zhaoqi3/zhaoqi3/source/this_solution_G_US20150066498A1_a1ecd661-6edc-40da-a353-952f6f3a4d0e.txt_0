[0029] high power consumption when it is running continuously;
[0030] potential threat to personal privacy by reconstructing the sampled raw data.
[0031] Voice command recognition has progressed in paralleled with the development of automatic speech recognition. Most digital based solution using a high-speed and high resolution ADC extract the features in the frequency domain like Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC), Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), etc. Statistical Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are then used to model the phonemes or words. Disadvantages of this solution include high computation complexity and power consumption.
[0032] FIG. 1 is an illustration of a device in which detection of a unique sound may be used to cause the system to perform a task or operation. In this example, a person 100 may be interacting with a mobile phone 120. System user 100 may be holding the cell phone and talking directly to it, or user 100 may be wearing an earpiece 110 that contains a microphone and detection circuitry and is in contact with mobile phone 120 via a Bluetooth wireless channel, for example. In either case, earphone 110 and/or phone 120 may often be placed in a low power state in order to conserve battery power. Occasionally, user 100 may wish to place a call or otherwise interact with phone 120 and may speak a known word or phrase, such as "hello", or "call", or any other word or phrase that device 110 or 120 has been configured to expect. Sound energy in the form of a sound wave 102 may be received by a microphone within earpiece 110 or phone 120 and converted to an analog electrical signal. However, in order for earpiece 110 or phone 120 to respond to a known voice command from user 100, some portion of detection logic must be powered on to determine when an expected voice command is received. Since user 100 may speak a large number of words and phrases that have nothing to do with earpiece 110 and/or phone 120, the detection logic must be able to recognize when an expected command is received without wasting a lot of battery power on non-expected words and phrases.
[0033] Embodiments of the invention, as described in more detail herein, may perform a process that extracts sparse sound information directly from an analog signal that may be processed using ultra low power analog or mixed signal circuitry. This process is referred to herein as "analog to information" (A2I).
