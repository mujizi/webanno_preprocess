[0046] The sizing agent adhering to the surface of the reinforcing fiber bundle of the present invention preferably contains a surfactant. The surfactant is preferably a nonionic surfactant or an anionic surfactant capable of emulsifying a hardly water-soluble polymer. Especially, a nonionic surfactant is preferred, and further, a nonionic surfactant having a low molecular weight is more preferred. Specific examples thereof include polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers. Surfactants having a boiling point of lower than 200.degree. C., more preferably lower than 150.degree. C. are preferred. On the other hand, use of a self-emulsifiable polymer prepared by introducing a hydrophilic group into the molecular terminal of a hardly water-soluble polymer is also preferred.
[0047] Also, the sizing agent to be made to adhere to the surface of the reinforcing fiber bundle of the present invention is preferably such that the 5% weight loss temperature in air thereof is 270.degree. C. or higher. This is because, in producing a composite material, the matrix resin (thermoplastic resin) is heated up to around 270.degree. C. to lower the viscosity thereof. When the 5% weight loss temperature in air of the sizing agent is lower than 270.degree. C., the physical properties of the composite material may worsen. This is because, in the process of producing the composite material, a decomposition gas may be generated to form voids in the matrix resin. On the other hand, a sizing agent whose 5% weight loss temperature is merely high may often contain a three-dimensionally crosslinked part, and such a sizing agent tends to hardly adhere to the surface of fiber bundles. A more preferred range of the 5% weight loss temperature in air of the sizing agent is 280 to 350.degree. C. especially 330.degree. C. or lower. The heat resistance of the sizing agent is greatly influenced by the structure of the molecular skeleton of the polymer contained therein. For example, in the case of an amine adduct, it is possible to obtain a sizing agent having high heat resistance by optimizing the structures of the epoxy resin and the amine compound to be the basic ingredients. For example, when a difunctional low-molecular alicyclic epoxy compound is reacted with an amine compound having a saturated alicyclic hydrocarbon structure of with a mixture of an amine compound having a saturated alicyclic hydrocarbon structure and an amine compound having an aliphatic structure, a linear water-soluble polymer especially suitable for use in the present invention as the weight loss in heating thereof is small can be obtained. The sizing agent to adhere to the surface of the carbon fiber bundle of the present invention preferably contains a polymer having such high heat resistance.
[0048] In general, for impregnating a high-viscosity matrix resin such as a thermoplastic resin into a reinforcing fiber bundle, the viscosity of the resin must be lowered, and impregnation treatment is carried out at a high temperature. Accordingly, the sizing agent to be used for the reinforcing fiber bundle must have high heat resistance enough to endure impregnation treatment with a matrix resin, and a high-molecular weight thermoplastic resin is often used, in addition, it is known that a high-molecular weight thermoplastic resin can be suitably entangled with the molecular chain of a matrix resin and can therefore increase the interface adhesion force between reinforcing fibers and a matrix resin. However, such a high-molecular weight sizing agent has a high viscosity and is therefore problematic in that it may too strongly converge reinforcing fibers in processing them and therefore may lose flowability. In particular, in producing a composite material via a random mat that is produced by suitably controlling reinforcing fiber bundles and single yarns as described below, this problem is serious. Since reinforcing fiber bundles could not be broken and separated in processing them, it was impossible to increase the resin impregnability in the thickness direction of reinforcing fiber bundles.
[0049] However, the sizing agent adhering to the surface of the reinforcing fiber bundle of the present invention has a melt viscosity at 150.degree. C. and at a shear rate of 10 s.sup.-1 is 300 Pas or less. In the case where the reinforcing fiber matrix with the sizing agent adhering thereto and a matrix resin are heated and pressurized to produce a composite material, the penetrability of the matrix resin into the inner layer part of the reinforcing fiber matrix is extremely bettered. The penetrability of the matrix resin can be significantly increased. Though not clear, the reason would be because the sizing agent whose melt viscosity at 150.degree. C. and at a shear rate of 10 s.sup.-1 is 300 Pas or less could have a low viscosity at the molding temperature of the composite material and therefore could greatly lower the convergence property of the fiber bundle. Consequently, in the molding process of producing a composite material that includes heating and pressuring of a matrix resin, the fiber bundles could readily be broken owing to the shear stress in flowing of the matrix resin, and the matrix resin could be in a state of readily penetrating into the thickness direction of the fiber bundles. The low-viscosity sizing agent adhering to the reinforcing fiber bundle may act as a plasticizer for the matrix resin to exhibit an effect of accelerating the resin penetration.
[0050] On the other hand, when the melt viscosity at 150.degree. C. and at a shear rate of 10 s.sup.-1 is more than 300 Pas, resin penetration into the inner layer part of the fiber bundle could hardly go on. This is because, since the resin viscosity is high, the convergence of the fiber bundle is strong, and therefore the fiber bundle could not be opened by the shear stress in flowing of the matrix resin. For securing better penetrability of the matrix resin into the inner layer of the reinforcing fiber bundle, the melt viscosity
