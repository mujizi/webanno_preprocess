[0003] 2. Background of the Related Art
[0004] The completion of wells includes the formation of a borehole to access areas of the earth adjacent underground formations. Thereafter, the borehole may be lined with steel pipe to form a wellbore and to facilitate the isolation of a portion of the wellbore with packers. The casing is perforated adjacent the area of the formation to be accessed to permit production fluids to enter the wellbore for recovery at the surface of the well. Whether the well is drilled to produce hydrocarbons, water, geothermal energy, or is intended as a conduit to stimulate other wells, the basic construction is the same. In addition to creating and perforating a wellbore, the formation surrounding a wellbore may be treated to enhance production of the well. For example, when a formation having very low permeability, but a sufficient quantity of valuable fluids is to be produced, it is necessary to artificially increase the formation's permeability. This is typically accomplished by "fracturing" the formation, a practice which is well known in the art and for which purpose many methods have been conceived. Basically, fracturing is achieved by applying sufficient pressure to the formation to cause it to crack or fracture, hence the term "fracturing" or simply "fracing". The desired result of this process is that the cracks interconnect the formation's pores and allow the valuable fluids to be brought out of the formation and to the surface.
[0005] The general sequence of steps needed to stimulate a production zone through which a wellbore extends is as follows: First, a performable nipple is made up in the well casing and cemented in at a predetermined depth in the well within the subterranean production zone requiring stimulation. Next a perforating trip is made by lowering a perforation assembly into the nipple on a tubular work-string. The perforating assembly is then detonated to create a spaced series of perforations extending outwardly through the nipple, the cement and into the production zone. The discharged gun assembly is then pulled up with the work-string to complete the perforating trip. Thereafter, stimulating and fracturing materials are injected into the well.
[0006] Another frequently used technique to complete a well is the placement of sized gravel in an annular area formed between the perforated casing and a screen member disposed on the end of tubing that is coaxially inserted into the wellbore as a conduit for production fluids. In order to eliminate or reduce the production of formation sand, a sand screen is typically placed adjacent to the perforations or adjacent to an open wellbore face through which fluids are produced. A packer is usually set above the sand screen and the annulus around the screen is then packed with a relatively course sand, commonly referred to as gravel, to form a gravel pack around the sand screen as well as in the perforations and/or in the producing formation adjacent the well bore for filtering sand out of the in-flowing formation fluids. In open hole gravel pack installations, the gravel pack also supports the surrounding unconsolidated formation and helps to prevent the migration of sand with produced formation fluids.
