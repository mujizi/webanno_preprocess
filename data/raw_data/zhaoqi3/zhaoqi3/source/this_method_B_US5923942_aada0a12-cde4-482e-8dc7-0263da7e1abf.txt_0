FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional setup of a computer 5 and a printer 1 attached via a cable and/or other network 3. The printer 1 includes a connection port 7 for attaching the cable and/or other network 3 to the printer 1 and a paper tray 9 for storage of paper to be used by the printer 1.
In printing devices, such as the printer 1, it is necessary for a printer engine and printer controller of the printing device to know the size of paper in each input tray. Since a document is imaged to print on a given sized paper, the printer controller needs paper size information in order to select the proper paper tray for printing a document. The printer engine requires the information so that it can properly feed and transport the paper through the printing system.
Some printers use a system of sensors to locate the paper guides or sense the edges of the paper, but this is a complicated and expensive method. Others use special cassettes for each paper size that are encoded in some manner with the paper size, however, this method is cumbersome since a different cassette is needed for each paper size.
Another less complicated and less expensive method is to have the user set a dial or slide associated with a paper tray that indicates the paper size and movable paper guides that can accommodate a range of paper sizes. However, for practical purposes, a dial or slide has a limited number of physical position settings.
FIG. 2 illustrates the details of the paper tray 9 which includes standard or pre-cut paper 11, paper guides 13, position settings 15, position setting identifiers 17, and a dial selector 19. Therefore, when a user needs to print on one of paper sizes A, B, or C corresponding to the position setting identifiers 17, the user moves the paper guides 13 to corresponding position settings 15, and positions the dial selector 19 to a selection corresponding to the position setting identifiers 17 and size of the standard or pre-cut paper 11. The printer 1 then reads the position of the dial selector 19 to register a size of the standard or pre-cut paper 11.
