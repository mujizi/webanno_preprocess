From these results, the high conversion efficiency of a CdS/CdTe solar cell, higher by about 32% over that of a conventional solar cell, is attributed to the high shortwave light transmittance by the smaller thickness of the invented CdS thin film used as its window layer, and the low leak-current due to the high-quality and dense CdS thin film. In the CdS/CdTe system thin film compound semiconductor solar cell, not only can an ITO layer be used as the transparent conductive electrode, but a tin oxide or zinc oxide system layer can be used. However, the sheet resistance in this case should desirably be kept at a value less than 100 ohm/cm.sup.2 because a sheet resistance above 100 ohm/cm.sup.2 may increase the internal resistance and degenerate the photoelectric characteristics of the solar cell.
EXAMPLE-6
In this case, a 10 cm square copper plate used as a thin film forming substrate on which a CdTe thin film is deposited by a proximity sublimation method is prepared. Then, a CdS/CdTe system thin film solar cell is deposited by a method in which the process order is reversed with respect to that of the thin film deposition method shown in Example-5. Namely, in this method, a CdS thin film is deposited first on a CdTe thin film by using the method shown in Example-1, and this is followed by a deposition of a transparent conductive electrode made mainly of indium oxide. Then, a transparent silicon oxide thin film is deposited thereon for the purpose of sealing the solar cell. The characteristics of this solar cell show an open voltage of 770 mV, a short-circuit current density of 24.5 mA/cm.sup.2, and an intrinsic photoelectric conversion efficiency of 12.3% (1.00 cm.sup.2).
EXAMPLE-7
In this case, on a surface of the soda-lime glass used as the thin film forming substrate, a molybdenum electrode is deposited by a vacuum deposition method, and a copper-indium selenide (CIS) thin film is overlaid by a multi-element evaporation method which deposits copper, indium, and selenium simultaneously. This is followed by a deposition of a CdS thin film on this substrate by a method similar to the one shown in Example-1 except that the temperature of the thin film forming substrate is kept at 300.degree. C. The solar cell construction process is completed by depositing the thin films of zinc oxide, ITO, and silicon oxide sequentially.
