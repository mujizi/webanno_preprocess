EXAMPLE 42I
1-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-4-methylazepane-4-carboxylic acid
[0206] A solution of Example 42H (1.6 g, 5.0 mmol) in a mixture of THF (20 mL) and water (10 mL) was treated with LiOH.H.sub.2O (530 mg, 12.2 mmol) in water (5 mL). Methanol was added until a transparent solution formed (5 mL). This solution was heated at 60.degree. C. for overnight and the organic solvents were removed under vacuum. The residual aqueous solution was acidified with 2 N HCl to pH 2 and was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic phase was washed with water, dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered and concentrated to give Example 421 (0.9 g, 62% yield). MS (DCI/NH.sub.3) m/z 292 (M+H).sup.+.
