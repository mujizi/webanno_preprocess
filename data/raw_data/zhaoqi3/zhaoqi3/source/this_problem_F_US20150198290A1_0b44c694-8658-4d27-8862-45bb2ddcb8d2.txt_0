[0148] Because the LED lamp arrangement operates at considerably higher voltage than the fluorescent tube it replaces, the starter, which is configured to be automatically enabled by the higher voltage during the initial power-up period before the current has risen to its normal operational value, will continue to periodically short-circuit the filaments of the lamp to the ballast, causing undesirable low-frequency flicker.
[0149] The starter may be removed from the luminaire to prevent this from happening, but failure of the end-user to do so may result in unsafe situations and destruction of the LED lamp arrangement. Another solution is to place a high impedance element across the pins of the LED lamp arrangement, i.e. where the heater coils are located in a fluorescent tube, with an impedance sufficiently high to prevent the starter from detecting the high voltage on the other side of the tube. This solution, however, will cause some electronic ballasts to wrongfully detect the end of life of the tube, causing it to shut down.
[0150] To address this problem, a further embodiment of the LED lamp arrangement may optionally include a variable impedance connected across the connectors of the LED lamp arrangement, e.g. the pins for connecting the LED lamp arrangement into a conventional fluorescent luminaire in the location usually used for a heater coil in a fluorescent tube. The presence of either a magnetic or an electronic ballast in the system is detected, and the variable impedance is adjusted to a high or a low impedance value depending on the detected type of ballast. An exemplary embodiment is depicted in FIG. 12, in which control circuit 53 controls a switch 52 to connect either a high impedance 51a or a low impedance 51b across the pin connectors 50a, 50b of the LED lamp arrangement. The variable impedance can be connected across one or both pairs of connectors present in the luminaire.
[0151] Further modifications in addition to those described above may be made to the structures and techniques described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, although specific embodiments have been described, these are examples only and are not limiting upon the scope of the invention.
