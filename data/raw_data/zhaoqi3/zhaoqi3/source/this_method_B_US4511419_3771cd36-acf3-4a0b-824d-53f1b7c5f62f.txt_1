Today we know numerous methods of bonding foils together. In particular, the following adhesives are used: waxes, thermoplastic adhesives, polymers, glues, dispersions, adhesive varnishes, and reactive adhesives. The basic materials for the production of all these laminating adhesives, except some glues, are highly refined mineral oil derivates which are produced with a high expenditure of energy.
Waxes, thermoplastic adhesives, and polymers are applied molten and undiluted, the average quantity being 15 to 20 g/m.sup.2. The adherency of the compounds is sensitive to water and relatively low.
Using glues and dispersions, the applied quantity of solids is about 2.5 g/m.sup.2, on an average. These adhesives must be applied diluted, the mainly used thinner being water. During the laminating process this water must be evaporated by application of process heat, thus heating the entire compound. Thereafter the compound must quickly be cooled down. It is true that with this method the consumption of adhesives is lower than with the methods mentioned before, but the toal amount of required process energy is considerably higher. The adhesive power of the compound is high and more heat-resistant. The method cannot be applied unless at least one of the materials to be laminated is highly permeable to steam.
So far the application of adhesive varnishes results in the highest adhesive power; it is possible to use adhesive varnishes with nearly all compound materials. The mainly used adhesives are heat-reactive and dissolved in organic solvents. The average consumption of adhesives is 12 g/m.sup.2, the quantity of solids being 4 g/m.sup.2 and the quantity of solvents being 8 g/m.sup.2. These solvents must be evaporated by application of process heat. In addition, they must be removed from the waste air for reasons of air pollution control. Regarding the high energy consumption, the problems of air pollution, and the resulting higher costs of investment and operation, this method is very disadvantageous.
As for the adherency properties which can be achieved the reactive adhesives correspond to the adhesive varnishes, approximately. At present, however, the universal application of such reactive adhesives is not yet possible as the methods are still in the phase of development and introduction. The reactive adhesives are applied without using solvents and less than 2 g/m.sup.2 is needed. Hereby the air pollution problems are solved and the energy consumption is largely reduced.
