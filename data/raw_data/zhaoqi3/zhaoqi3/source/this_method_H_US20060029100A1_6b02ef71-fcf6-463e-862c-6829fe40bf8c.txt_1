[0058] In step 620, the nodes 110 will follow the IEEE 802.3 Clause 36 auto-negotiation process as known to those skilled in the art.
[0059] In step 625, when FLP LINK GOOD condition exists (i.e., fast link pulse (FLP), which is a series of link pulses that are spaced closely together, is received), and Link=OK (i.e., the link 105 has been initialized and communication has been established), then the data D is set to a value of 0, so that configuration information is no longer transmitted across the link. Both nodes 110 at this point have agreed upon the negotiated configuration information and will set their speed, duplex nature, and/or other configuration to the negotiated configuration.
[0060] By this method 600, modulation of a code-stream onto the IDLE sequence allows two ends 110 of a link 105 to exchange information consistent with the IEEE 802.3 clause 36 auto-negotiation process.
[0061] In the example below, node 110a is described as sending the configuration information in the data D across the link 105. However, node 110b can also asynchronously send configuration information in a data D across the link 105.
[0062] It is noted that Clause 48 of the IEEE 803.2 standard allows for the use of either of two polynomials for generation of a uniform, pseudorandom distribution of .parallel.R.parallel. and .parallel.K.parallel. symbols. The one cited above, (X.sup.7+X.sup.6+1), or (X.sup.7+X.sup.3+1). When a device implementing an embodiment of this invention is attached to a device that implements the alternate polynomial (X.sup.7+X.sup.3+1), the output of the D value from the descrambler will appear to be "garbage".
