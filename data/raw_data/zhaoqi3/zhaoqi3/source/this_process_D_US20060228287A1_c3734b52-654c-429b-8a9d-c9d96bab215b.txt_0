[0041] It is believed that resistively heating the nanotube may reduce the nanodevice material removal through two possible mechanisms. It has been shown that raising the temperature of nanotubes to over 300.degree. C. reduces knock-on damage by annealing out defects via an increased mobility of interstitial atoms.sup.12. Also, by increasing the temperature of the nanotube the sticking coefficient of water molecules impinging on the surface is decreased, thus limiting the number of assist gas species present to reactively aid in cutting.
[0042] Thus, it is further believed that at a constant electron beam scan current, the rate of cutting can be independently controlled by varying the temperature of a nanodevice from below room temperature, to room temperature, to 300.degree. C.; at lower temperatures, material removal is increased, while at higher temperature, material removal is decreased.
[0043] It is interesting that at temperatures of around 300.degree. C. and higher, it appears that unintentional collateral damage (to a carbon-based nanodevice during low voltage material removal with an assist gas) is annealed both during material removal and afterwards. It is thought that this process is due to the higher mobility of interstitial atoms at these temperatures; essentially, they are able to move and fill damaged sites in the atomic lattice.
[0044] FIG. 3 shows the results of cutting two nanotubes exposed to different partial pressures of water at various beam currents. At a higher partial pressure, increasing the beam current speeds up the cutting process. This appears to be a consequence of adding more energy to the system, thus increasing the rate of the chemical reactions active in removing material. At low water vapor pressure (210.sup.-6 Torr), however, the material removal effect was greatly suppressed, and even high beam currents (.about.500 pA) were found to not significantly increase cutting speed. The present invention contemplates that at low pressures, the material removal rate is more limited by the number density of water present, rather than the amount of energy supplied by the electron beam.
[0045] For carbon-based nanodevices, a maximum nanodevice temperature for the carbon components would typically be about 2700.degree. K, at which point the carbon vaporizes. At the much lower temperature of about 600.degree. K, however, carbon would react with water vapor to form carbon monoxide, CO.
