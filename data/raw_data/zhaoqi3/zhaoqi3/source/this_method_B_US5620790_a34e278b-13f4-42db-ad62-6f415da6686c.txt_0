Due to the method of manufacturing disclosed in EP 05 94 007, it is clear to one skilled in the art that the subsequently poured-on separating layer must relate to an asymmetrical layer. For example, it is indicated that the solution for effecting the coagulation is contacted by a nonsolvent; otherwise, no nonsolvent fraction in the polymer solution is mentioned in this reference. Pursuant to Staude "Membranen und Membranprozesse", Weinheim 1992, page 10 et seq, it is made clear that both conditions indicate the formation of asymmetrical membranes. However, it is evident that such membranes have relatively poor useful lives.
In DE-OS 37 01 633 and DE-OS 37 40 871 the drawbacks discussed in connection with asymmetrical membranes, the fragile separating layer (skin) is disposed in the interior of the membrane, and hence is better protected, via a controlled step in a dry-wet process. However, as before there is still the drawback of a relatively thin separating layer, so that faults that might be present in the membranes, such as oversized pores, can significantly impair the retention characteristic of the membranes. In EP 0 083 489 B1, the problems related to the sensitivity of the skin of asymmetrical microfiltration membranes are addressed by superimposing two asymmetrical membranes upon one another in such a way that their skins contact one another. However, this approach has the drawback that the manufacturing process is relatively expensive and complicated, and furthermore the pore characteristic established by the pore sizes of the skin relative to the exclusion magnitude of particles varies as a consequence of the static arrangement of respectively oppositely disposed pores or matrix material.
If fine-pored microfiltration membranes having nominal pore sizes of less than 0.45 .mu.m are installed in filter cartridges, the porosity of these membranes at their edges is greater than the porosity at their surfaces. As a consequence, the filtration characteristics established by the pore characteristic of the membrane are not achieved. Thus, DE-PS 3 818 860 utilizes a combination of at least three membranes having different materials and different pore sizes and pore geometries, so that the coarse-pored membrane performs the function of a preliminary filter and the fine-pored membrane performs the function of a final filter. Thus, with this hybrid technology fine-pored microfiltration membranes having nominal pore sizes of less than 0.45 .mu.m can also be used in filter cartridges. However, the drawback is that during installation in the filter cartridges, the membranes that are placed one upon the other are not as easy to handle as are individual membranes. When the filter cartridges are sterilized with steam, the outer membrane layers can swell, which leads to damage. U.S. Pat. No. 4,340,480 discloses an individual multi-layer membrane having integral individual layers where the individual layers are pressed upon one another in a wet state and are dried together. However, this method of manufacture is possible only with such polymers that have a high water absorbtiveness, such as polyamide 66, which is used in this reference and has a water absortiveness (saturation) of 8.5% by weight.
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide microfiltration membranes which, as individual membranes, are built up from two or more integral layers, which while exhibiting a high retention rate and a high reliability at the same time have a high sludge carrying capacity (service life), which are economically made of the same membrane material, whereby polymeric material having a low water absortivity can also be used, and which, with a nominal pore size of below 0.45 .mu.m, can also be used in membrane filter cartridges without difficulty.
The microfiltration membrane of the present invention is characterized primarily in that the final filter layer has a thickness of between 50 and 300 .mu.m and a symmetrical pore structure, with the ratio of the thickness of the final filter layer to the thickness of the prefiltration layer ranging from between 1:4 to 4:1. As a consequence, in contrast to the heretofore known MF membranes, the inventive membranes, when used as a filter, advantageously provide a high retention rate coupled with a minimum clogging of the MF membranes. The combination of an integrated final filter layer, which is symmetrical with respect to its pore structure and is relatively thick, with at least one integrated prefiltration layer, provides an extremely serviceable MF membrane that can be manufactured relatively economically with simple means, and that is much more sturdy than are asymmetrical membranes. Thus, due to a uniform pore structure of the final filter layer in conjunction with a thickness thereof of 50 to about 300 .mu.m, slight damages that would already lead to failure, i.e., total loss, of the known membranes, can be tolerated.
