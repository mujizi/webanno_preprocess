[0099] PVD can be classified based on the methods used to produce the vapor and the energy involved in the deposition and growth of the film; but the two main processes are evaporation and sputtering. In thermal evaporation, the material to be deposited the evaporant is heated to the temperature at which it vaporizes. The vapor condenses as a solid onto the substrates that are maintained between ambient and temperatures below the melting point. Molecules travel virtually in straight lines between the source and the substrate, and deposition is line-of-sight; the laws governing the deposition thickness are similar to the laws governing illumination. The vapor is produced by heating the evaporant in thermal evaporation and by bombarding the evaporant with a beam of electrons in electron-beam evaporation. In sputtering, the vapor is produced by bombarding a target with energetic particles, mostly ions, so that atoms and molecules are ejected from the target. Such vapor particles have much more energy than those involved in evaporation, and this energy influences the condensation and film-growth processes. In particular, the microstructure of the films deposited by sputtering is usually more compact and solid than those deposited by evaporation. In other variations of PVD, the condensation of evaporated material is supplied with additional energy by direct bombardment by energetic particles. In ion-beam-assisted deposition (IBAD), the energy is supplied by an ion gun. Such processes, together with sputtering, are known as energetic processes. The major benefit of energetic processes is an increase in film packing densities. The dielectric chemistry can be controlled by activated reactive evaporation (ARE) or reactive sputtering with the introduction of gases (e.g., O.sub.2, N.sub.2, CO.sub.2) into the process that react with the evaporant, resulting in deposited materials with widely different material properties and ranges of refractive indices.
[0100] In thin-film deposition, a good general rule is that the lower the process pressure and the more energetic the process, the more control exists over the film properties, but the higher the cost of the equipment and the coating. The IBAD electron-beam (e-beam) chamber (illustrated in FIG. 15) in the NREL multichamber vacuum system Was used to begin proof-of-concept based on the versatility and lower cost for initial material prototyping. The e-beam gun uses 7-cc crucibles to deposit six materials sequentially or can co-deposit two different materials simultaneously. Dielectrics can be evaporated directly or reactively, and an ion gun can be used to improve the quality, composition, and density of the coating. However, there are necessarily trade-offs in the microstructure between a highly oxidation-resistant coating (i.e., amorphous or nanocrystalline) and a solar-selective coating with both high absorption (i.e., columnar or porous microstructure) and low emittance (i.e., smooth or highly dense).
[0101] The IBAD chamber 92 shown in FIG. 15 includes a large vacuum chamber 92 with an oscillating large area substrate 95 located at the rear (upper portion in figure). A turbo pump 97 (not shown here) maintains the low vacuum pressure. The dual E-beam evaporant plumes 98A and 98B are ejected from crucibles in E-beam guns 106A and 106B. This arrangement permits codeposition of materials with different precursor materials placed in the two crucibles 93 placed in the evaporators. Operation of the two E-beam guns produces two evaporator beams 99A and 99B which deposit materials on substrate 95. When the ion gun 96 is activated during this process, a broad ion beam 94 is generated and ion assisted codeposition takes place.
[0102] A different configuration of an IBAD chamber 90 is shown in FIG. 16, operating within a similar vacuum chamber 92 and using the turbo pump 97. Dual E-beam guns 106A and 106B are provided, with crucibles 101A and 101B. The operation of the E-beam guns produces overlapping evaporant plumes 104A and 104B. Three ion guns 96 are provided to superimpose ion beams on the plumes to modify the morphology of the coating. Rather than a planar target as in FIG. 17, a receiver tube substrate carousel 100 is provided, containing a set of individual receiver tubes 102. This part of the apparatus is configured so that the carousel can be rotated while the individual tubes are also rotated, in both cases clockwise (or counter clockwise) to achieve uniformity around the receiver tubes.
[0103] The material to be evaporated is in the form of solid slugs, pellets or powders of metal or dielectric material. There are two electron guns, each having a power from a few tens to hundreds of kW. An electron beam gun consists of a source of electrons (a hot filament) that are accelerated using a high voltage power supply. Electron beams can be generated by thermionic emission, field emission or the anodic are method. The generated electron beam is accelerated to a high kinetic energy and focused towards the source material using electromagnetic force and diverted through an angle of 270.degree., using a permanent magnet into a crucible where the material evaporates. When the accelerating voltage is between 20 kV-25 kV and the beam current is a few amperes, 85% of the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into thermal energy as the beam bombards the surface of the ingot. The surface temperature of the material increases, resulting in the formation of a liquid melt. Although some of the incident electron energy is lost in the excitation of X-rays and secondary emission, the liquid material evaporates under vacuum. The source material itself is contained in a copper crucible which is cooled by water circulation. The evaporation rate may be on the order of 10.sup.-2 g/cm.sup.2 sec.
