Sixth Embodiment
[0189] A sixth embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the sixth embodiment, compression and expansion of the image data are considered, and a method that can be applied to the second and the fifth embodiment will be described. For specific description, it is supposed that the moving image 700 illustrated in FIG. 33 is recorded in the external memory 18.
[0190] When the moving image 700 is recorded in the external memory 18, the image data of the moving image 700 is compressed by a predetermined compression method performed by the compression processing unit 16 illustrated in FIG. 1. Any compression method may be adopted. For instance, a compression method defined in Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) or a compression method defined in H.264 can be used. Hereinafter, image data that is compressed is particularly referred to as compressed image data, and image data that is not compressed is particularly referred to as non-compressed image data. When the moving image 700 is reproduced on the display unit 27, the compressed image data of the moving image 700 read out from the external memory 18 is sent to the expansion processing unit 19 illustrated in FIG. 1, and the expansion processing unit 19 performs an expansion process for restoring the compressed image data to non-compressed image data. The non-compressed image data of the moving image 700 obtained by this process is sent to the display processing unit 20, so that the moving image 700 is displayed as images on the display unit 27.
[0191] The non-compressed image data of the moving image 700 is a set of still images that are independent of each other. Therefore, the non-compressed image data that is the same as that transmitted to the display processing unit 20 is written in the internal memory 17 illustrated in FIG. 1 as necessary, so that the stroboscopic still image or the stroboscopic moving image can be generated from the non-compressed image data stored in the internal memory 17. Actually, after the setting operation of the candidate image sequence is performed by the user (see Step S162 illustrated in FIG. 35), the non-compressed image data that is the same as that transmitted to the display processing unit 20 during the reproduction section of the candidate image sequence should be written in the internal memory 17. In order to generate the stroboscopic image on the basis of the compressed image data, it is necessary to expand the compressed image data. As described above, the expansion process that is performed for reproducing images can be used for the above-mentioned expansion.
[0192] Further, in MPEG, an MPEG moving image that is a compression moving image is generated by utilizing a difference between frames. As known well, the MPEG moving image is constituted of three types of picture, including an I-picture that is an intra-coded picture, a P-picture that is a predictive-coded picture, and a B-picture that is a bidirectionally predictive-coded picture. Since the I-picture is an image obtained by coding an video signal of one frame image within the frame image, it is possible to decode the video signal of the one frame image by the single I-picture. In contrast, by a single P-picture, the video signal of one frame image cannot be decoded. In order to decode the frame image corresponding to the P-picture, it is necessary to perform a differential operation or the like with another picture. The same is true for the B-picture. Therefore, operational load necessary for decoding the frame image corresponding to the P-picture or the B-picture is larger than that corresponding to the I-picture.
