[0022] In addition, the aqueous dispersion (Y) has excellent properties while comprising biodegradable modified starch, and can be applied in a wide range of fields including not only coating materials but also inks, adhesives, molding agents and the like. However, it is especially useful when applied as a coating material because it can form coated films with excellent finished appearance, hardness, weather resistance, etc.
[0023] [III] In order to achieve the third object there is provided the invention according to claims 16 to 26, which include the invention of a process of forming a coating film that comprises the steps of coating a substrate with an aqueous coating composition (I) to form a base coating film, coating the base coating film with an active energy radiation curable coating composition (II), and then irradiating it with an active energy radiation, wherein the aqueous coating composition (I) is an aqueous coating composition comprising an aqueous dispersion (Z) obtained by radical polymerization reaction of a radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture (f1), consisting of less than 5% by mass of a carboxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer, 5-95% by mass of a hydroxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer and 5-95% by mass of other radical polymerizable unsaturated monomers, in the presence of starch and/or modified starch (e) to obtain a reaction product, radical polymerization reaction of a radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer mixture (f2) consisting of 5-95% by mass of a carboxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer, 5-95% by mass of a hydroxyl group-containing radical polymerizable unsaturated monomer and 0-90% by mass of other radical polymerizable unsaturated monomers, in the presence of the reaction product, to obtain an acrylic modified starch (E) with an acid value in the range of 10-150 mgKOH/g, and then dispersing the acrylic modified starch (E) in an aqueous medium, and the active energy radiation curable coating composition (II) is an active energy radiation curable coating composition comprising a saccharide and/or derivative thereof with an acryloyl group, and a photopolymerization initiator.
[0024] In the process of forming a coating film described above, an aqueous coating composition comprising a specific acrylic modified starch obtained using starch and/or modified starch as the starting material is coated onto a substrate to form a base coating film, and the base coating film is coated with an active energy radiation curable coating composition comprising a saccharide and/or derivative thereof with an acryloyl group, and subsequently irradiated with an active energy radiation. This process of forming a coating film can reduce usage of petroleum resources and reduce environmental pollution due to low total carbon dioxide output in the product life cycle, and yield multilayer coating films with excellent finished appearance, pencil hardness, mar resistance, interlayer adhesion, weather resistance, alkali resistance and solvent resistance. It can also reduce organic solvent usage since it employs an aqueous coating composition for at least part of the coating composition used.
[0025] Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained. It is to be understood, however, that the present invention is not restricted by the specific embodiments described herein.
