Example 14
This example illustrates that mixed oxide formation can be achieved for supported Ce/Zr mixed-metal oxides after calcination at low temperatures using preparation procedures of the present invention.
A supported CeO.sub.2 /ZrO.sub.2 (Ce atom %=66; Zr atom %=34) mixed-metal oxide was prepared as follows. 486 grams of Ce nitrate solution (20 wt. % Ce) were added to 1,200 grams of deionized water. To this solution were added 123 grams of ZrO(NO.sub.3).sub.2.XH.sub.2 O supplied by Aldrich (Zr=25.7 wt. %) and heated with stirring until it was all dissolved. 393 grams of anhydrous citric acid were then added and dissolved.
The resultant solution was transferred to a blender and 400 grams of .gamma.-Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 were then added with stirring to give a uniform slurry. The resultant slurry was eiger-milled for 2 minutes and transferred to a rotatory steam evaporator and evaporated to dryness. The dried powder was then calcined at 600.degree. C. (initially in 4%O.sub.2 /96%N.sub.2 for 6 hours followed by air at 600.degree. C. for 1 hour).
The powder was then caked, sieved to 20-40 mesh and Pt and Rh added at a loading of 0.8 wt. % and a weight ratio of Pt/Rh=5. After the precious metal addition samples of the above catalyst were calcined at 600.degree. C., 700.degree. C., 800.degree. C. and 960.degree. C. in air for 6 hours and the lattice parameters measured using X-Ray diffraction (XRD).
