[0094] ATP (0.025 g), uracil (0.0075 g), PABA (0.0012 g), DC-Ca.sup.++pantotheate (0.05 g). riboflavin (0.005 g), NaCl (142.50 g), CaCl.sub.2 (3.00 g), MgCl.sub.2 (3.125 g) and EGF (0.00025 g) were then added. The solution was again gently mixed for about 15 minutes, during which time a 20 ml volume or absolute ethanol was obtained, to which were added vitamin A acetate (0.0035 g), vitamin D2 (0.0025 g), menadione (0.00025 g), lipoic acid (0.0019 g) and linoleic acid (0.00088 g). After allowing the compounds to dissolve in the ethanol, the ethanol solution was added to the 20 liter medium solution from above, and the medium solution was gently mixed for about 5 minutes.
[0095] Biotin (0.0019 g), folic acid (0.05 g), hypoxanthine.Na (0.0415 g), xanthine.Na (0.0075 g) and insulin-Zn.sup.++ (0.125 g) were added to a 20 ml volume of ddH.sub.2O. After allowing the compounds to dissolve in the water, this water solution was added to the 20 liter medium solution from above, and the medium solution was gently mixed for about 5 minutes.
[0096] The pH or the solution was then adjusted with 5N HCl or 5N NaOH to about 7.15.+-.0.50. To this solution were then added adenine sulfate (0.25 g), D-glucose (97.56 g), choline chloride (0.20 g), i-inositol (0.45 g), nicotinic acid (0.00062 g), niacinamide (0.05 g), sodium pyruvate (3.75 g), 2-deoxyribose (0.0125 g), KCl (8.0 g), putreseine.2HCl (0.0015 g), phosphoethanolamine (0.03 g), vitamin B12 (0.0125 g), HEPES (45.0 g), NaHCO.sub.3 (55.0 g) and phenol red (0.10 g).
[0097] This solution was gently mixed for about 10-15 minutes, the pH was then adjusted with 5N HCl or 5N NaOH to about 7.20.+-.0.10, and ddH.sub.2O was added to bring the final volume of the solution up to 25.0 liters. The osmolarity of the solution was determined to be about 310.+-.10 mOsm. This basal medium formulation was then filtered through a low protein-binding filter cartridge and stored at 4.degree. C. in conditions of diminished light until use.
