[0003] 2. Background Art
[0004] Generally, when the turbine is started, temperature of steam discharging into the casing of the turbine is elevated, while a flow rate of the steam is increased, so that the surface temperature of a metallic material located on the surface of the turbine rotor is first elevated. Then the heat of the surface of the turbine rotor is transmitted to the interior of the turbine rotor by heat conduction. Therefore, the internal temperature of the metallic material located in the turbine rotor is elevated later than the surface temperature of the metallic material on the surface of the turbine rotor. As a result, a difference of temperature distribution occurs between the surface and the interior of the turbine rotor, leading to thermal stress exerted on the turbine rotor. If such thermal stress is considerably great, the life span of the turbine rotor may be substantially shortened.
[0005] To address this problem, a system for controlling start of the turbine, such that the thermal stress generated in the turbine rotor of the turbine can be controlled to be lower than a defined value as well as the time required for starting the turbine can be made shorter, has been known (e.g., see Patent Documents 1 and 2).
[0006] In the system for starting-controlling the steam turbine described in the Patent Document 1, the start of the turbine is controlled, by obtaining a turbine-speed increasing ratio indicative of a ratio of changing the rotating speed of the turbine rotor and a load increasing ratio indicative of a ratio of increasing load of a power generator, such that the temperature of a first-stage metal located at a first stage on an outer circumference of the turbine rotor, or the like, can be changed in accordance with a predetermined changing pattern.
[0007] Meanwhile, the system for starting-controlling the turbine described in the Patent Document 2 is configured for performing calculation on the assumption that both of the turbine-speed increasing ratio of the turbine rotor and the load increasing ratio of the power generator are constant, thereby to substantially reduce the number of variables used in the calculation, thus facilitating the calculation.
