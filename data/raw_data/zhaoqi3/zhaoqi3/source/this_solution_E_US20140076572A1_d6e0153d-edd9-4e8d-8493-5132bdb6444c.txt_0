General Procedures to Make a Armovis EHS Gel (VES) and Rheology Testing
[0062] A brine solution containing 4-8% of salt by weight was stirred in a 500 ml stainless steel blender. To this solution, certain amount (by volume) of Armovis EHS concentrate (40% to 50% by weight in a mixed solvent system containing Ethanol, Propylene glycol and water) was added to the brine solution. The resulting mixture was stirred for 3 min at an rpm of 2000-3000 in a blender. The resultant gel was then centrifuged at an rpm of 1000 for 15 min to remove the air bubbles. Rheological performance was evaluated using a Grace Instrument Rheometer (model M5600) at constant shear rate at different temperatures. A pressure of 400 psi was applied to minimize evaporation of the sample, especially at high temperatures.
[0063] Fracturing of a subterranean formation needs a thickened fluid through a wellbore and formation to initiate and extend a fracture into the formation. High viscous fluid is used to prevent the fluid leak off and carry the proppant into the fracture. The polymers have been used to prepare a thickened fluid in the past, however, several disadvantages were observed for polymer-based fracturing fluids: 1) They are shear sensitive. Synthetic polymer-based fracturing fluids are shear thinning non Newtonian fluids. The viscosity is low at high shear rate and does not build up again once the shear rate decreases. 2) They are not salt tolerant. The polymers often precipitate from the solutions with high salinity and can cause severe formation damage. 3) Biopolymers are not very thermally stable. Besides, biocide or oxygen scavenger is needed to keep from biodegradation. 4) A breaker has to be used to break down the viscosity of the gel. However, the break down efficiency is usually very low even though a breaker is used. To overcome all of these shortcomings, surfactant-based fracturing fluids have been generated to give a much cleaner system for the subterranean formation. The fluids are often made in 4-8% KCl or NH.sub.4Cl solutions to stabilize the clay/shale formation.
