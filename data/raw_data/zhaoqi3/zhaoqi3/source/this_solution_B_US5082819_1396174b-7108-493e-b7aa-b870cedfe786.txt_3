The further processing of the calcined sprayed dried powder takes place as in Example 5.
EXAMPLE 7
The coprecipitate for making the active catalyst phase is obtained by dissolving 646.4 g Fe(NO.sub.3).sub.3.9H.sub.2 O, 174.6 g Co(NO.sub.3).sub.2. 6H.sub.2 O, 1744.8 g Ni(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O and 0.1 g KNO.sub.3 in 3.1 liters of water; and, while stirring, at 90.degree. C., one first of all adds a solution of 34.9 g Sm.sub.2 O.sub.3 in 212 g of concentrated HNO.sub.3. To this solution while stirring further, one adds 600.9 g highly dispersed silicic acid (Aerosil 200) and 1201.8 g of tempered montmorillonite (specific surface according to BET <1 m.sup.2 /g). In a separate vessel, at 60.degree. C., one prepares a solution of 2118.6 g (NH.sub.4).sub.6 Mo.sub.7 O.sub.24 .6H.sub.2 O in 2.7 liters H.sub.2 O and, while stirring intensively, one adds to it 115.3 g of 85% H.sub.3 PO.sub.4. Thereafter, both solutions are combined while stirring intensively and a solution of 727.7 g Bi(NO.sub.3).sub.3.5H.sub.2 O in 612.0 g of 8.2% HNO.sub.3 is added. The suspension thus obtained is dried in a spray drier at a drying air entry of 550.degree. C. The ratio between drying air volume and spray suspension quantity is adjusted here so that one obtains an exit temperature of 170.degree. C. and the suspension quantity is adjusted so that one obtains a duration of 6 seconds spent by the spray dried powder in the spray dryer. The atomization intensity is selected so that one gets a spray dried powder with an average diameter of dp=25 .mu.m. The spray dried powder is calcined for 30 minutes in a rotary cylindrical kiln at a maximum temperature of the spray dried powder of 420.degree. C.
The further processing of the calcined spray dried powder takes place as in Example 5.
In Example 8, the same catalyst composition as in Example 2 is shaped, except that, in Example 8, one used cellulose powder instead of pentaerythritol, as pore forming agent.
