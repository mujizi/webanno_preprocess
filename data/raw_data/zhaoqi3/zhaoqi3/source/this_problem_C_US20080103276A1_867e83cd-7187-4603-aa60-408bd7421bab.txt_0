[0008]In the fabricating process of such LEDs, a phosphor and a polymer encapsulant such as PDMS are mixed, and thereafter, the mixture is disposed on a chip by using a syringe, as depicted in FIG. 1. In the process, it is important to load the mixture on the chip in an amount that enables a uniform distribution of the mixture on the chip. FIG. 2 is a graph representing a scatter diagram obtained in an example where a paste prepared by mixing a phosphor and a polymer encapsulant is dispensed by using a device of FIG. 1.
[0009]As described in FIG. 2, in the prior art, since the phosphors are widely dispersed around an E area, and in a B area or an F area as well as in an E area, the amount of coating of the phosphor on a chip may be varied according to time, whereby each of the fabricated LEDs has a different chromatic coordinate. It is desirable for all of the phosphors to be uniformly dispersed with the area labeled E. However because of differences in specific gravity between the phosphors and the polymer encapsulant, the amount of coating of the phosphors on the chip vary widely with time, and hence the phosphors are widely dispersed over the areas labeled E, B and F in the FIG. 2.
[0010]This is because the phosphors sink due to the difference in specific gravity between the phosphor and the polymer encapsulant. To minimize this problem, the phosphors should not precipitate within the polymer encapsulant with the passage of time and they should be uniformly dispersed as well.
[0011]Korean Patent Laid-open Publication No. 10-2004-42241 discloses a method for increasing the hydrophobicity of a phosphor by removing a hydrophilic group with a silane compound. However, this method does not result in the improving of the dispersibility of the phosphor within the encapsulant matrix. Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2003-37295 describes a method for improving dispersibility within a matrix by coating a phosphor with a silane compound. This method, however, drastically increases viscosity of the mixture of the encapsulant and the phosphor, leading to the difficulties in applying the mixture to a chip to obtain light of the desired wavelength. Thus, is therefore a need for the development of a method for controlling fluidity of a phosphor-encapsulant mixture so as to prevent the precipitation of a phosphor within a polymer encapsulant as well as to increase the dispersibility by uniformly mixing the phosphor.
[0012]In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for controlling the fluidity of a phosphor, which decreases the rate of settling of a phosphor within a polymer encapsulant by reducing the density of the phosphor and thereby minimizing the occurrence of microturbulence.
