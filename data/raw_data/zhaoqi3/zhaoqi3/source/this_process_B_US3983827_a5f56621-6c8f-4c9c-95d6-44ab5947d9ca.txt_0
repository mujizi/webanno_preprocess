In FIG. 2, an illustration of the second phase of the cold-forming sequence, movement of the upper draw pad 52 downwardly moves the lower draw pad 80 downwardly against the urging of means 82. In press 10, means (not shown) are provided for driving the draw pad 52 downwardly.
In the second phase of the cold-forming sequence, as the draw pads 52,80 move downwardly, the radially outer peripheral edge portion 106 of the blank is drawn first radially inwardly toward the center of press 10 and then downwardly conformably about wall 86 of horn 12 to define a skirt S. As outer annular portion 106 of the plastic sheet is drawn radially inwardly toward the axis of forming press 10 to form skirt S, it continues to be drawn across the scoring edges 124 of scoring blades 122. During the drawing process, the surface of the plastic sheet is cut or scored by edges 124 to a depth controlled by shoulder 89.
Referring now to an alternative embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 3-5, it may be desirable to tilt the radially outward portions 125 of cutting edges 124 upwardly so that, near the radially outward extent 106 of the blank, the scoring line cuts substantially completely through the plastic sheet. Of course, radially inwardly from the edge the sheet is scored but not cut completely through. Since the plastic part made by this process is cut completely through at its outer periphery, it is easy to begin to tear loose the pull-tab thus formed, yet the tab is firmly attached to the part radially inwardly from the edge thereof.
In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 6, the scoring knives 122 are located to provide vertically extending scoring edges 124 on the interior walls 60 of the upper draw pad 52. Thus, in the embodiment of FIG. 6, scoring edges 124 extend generally parallel to the axis of press 10. As the plastic sheet is drawn downwardly between walls 60,86 to form the depending skirt S during the second phase of the forming operation, the scoring edges 124 are pulled downwardly across the surface of the plastic sheet to form the pull-tab.
In the two alternative embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 1-4 and 5, respectively, the scoring will appear on the bottom and top sides, respectively, of the plastic sheet. Of course, the scoring knives can be placed in the downwardly facing surface 54 of draw pad 52 to score the top surface of the plastic sheet. Further, if desired, both the bottom and top surfaces of the blank can be scored at the same time as the plastic part is being formed, e.g., by putting scoring knives in both draw pad surfaces 54,88.
