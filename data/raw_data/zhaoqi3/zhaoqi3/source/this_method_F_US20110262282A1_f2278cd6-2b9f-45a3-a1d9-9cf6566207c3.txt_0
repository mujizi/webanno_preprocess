[0017] According to a further preferred design of the method of the present invention, at least two core parts of a core are guided on one another in a movable manner. For this, a guide path may be formed in one core part, in which guide path a further core part is guided in a movable manner. The guiding of the core parts to one another simplifies the construction of the tool, since a separate guide in the outer tool does not need to be provided for each core part. Moreover, the core parts may also be moved together in such a manner. For example, it is possible for one core part to be moved firstly alone by a certain path, and then in the further course of movement to move together with a further core part. In this case, it is useful for these two core parts to be connected to one another or movable guided on one another, in a suitable manner.
[0018] As already described above, in a special design of the method, it is possible for the cores which define the flow channels in the inside of the impeller, in each case to comprise at least one core part which is pulled radially inwardly out of the flow channel. Further core parts are then preferably pulled radially outwardly out of the flow channel. Thus, it is preferable for the part of the core which is largest with regard to volume, to be moved radially outwardly out of the flow channel, since more space is available there, than in the central region of the impeller, where only the space which later forms the suction port of the impeller is present. However, depending on the geometry of the flow channels, it may be useful to remove a core part radially inwardly out of the flow channels. Thus, it is conceivable firstly for one core part to be moved radially outwardly, by which means a free space is then created, which permits a movement of the second core part which is then removed radially inwardly out of the impeller. Subsequently, further core parts may be then removed radially outwardly. The radially inwardly moving core parts may be formed by a core which collapses inwardly. In order to create the free space which permits the collapse of the core radially inwardly, it is preferably for a further central core element, which defines the entry opening or the suction port of the impeller, to be previously pulled out of the impeller in the axial direction, i.e., parallel to the rotation axis of the impeller.
[0019] Apart from the previously described method, the present invention also relates to a pump impeller which is preferably manufactured with this method. The pump impeller according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes two axially distanced cover plates and impeller blades arranged between the cover plates, wherein flow channels are defined between the impeller blades. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the two cover plates and the impeller blades thereby are manufactured as one piece by injection molding. For example, the impeller according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is manufactured in one part in a casting procedure and is not composed of several parts. Thereby, the impeller may be formed by injection molding from plastic or metal, i.e., with die casting.
