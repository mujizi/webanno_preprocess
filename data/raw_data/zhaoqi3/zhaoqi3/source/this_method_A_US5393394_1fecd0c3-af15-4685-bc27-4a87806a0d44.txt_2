In the catalytic method, decomposition of the organic halogen-containing compound is carried out with a catalyst in a liquid phase by consuming oxygen contained in the liquid phase. This method is easily practiced and does not need much driving energy, therefore it is economically advantageous. However, the decomposition efficiency is rather low due to low concentration of the oxygen in the liquid phase. Moreover, halide products such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, etc. which are generated by the decomposition reaction cause a problem by rapidly reducing the activity of the catalyst.
In the ultraviolet radiation method, an organic halogen-containing compound in the gaseous state is decomposed by irradiating with ultraviolet rays. In this method, the halide products produced in the decomposition reaction hinder further process of the decomposition reaction. As a result, it becomes difficult to complete the decomposition reaction of the organic halogen-containing compounds by ultraviolet irradiation only, and the decomposition efficiency remains low. Moreover, this method involves the risk of damaging the apparatus with corrosive halide gases at a higher frequency than in conventional methods. In addition, this method tends to require large-scale apparatus. Therefore, this method is disadvantageous, unless the above-described problem with decomposition efficiency is solved.
In the sodium decomposition method, the organic halogen-containing compounds are decomposed with sodium at a high decomposition efficiency. However, since this method consumes a large amount of the sodium material, it is economically disadvantageous. Moreover, in the apparatus for carrying out this method, it is necessary to provide much equipment for ensuring operational safety during handling of the sodium material. As a result, this apparatus requires a large space for installation.
Of the above-described decomposition methods, the ultraviolet radiation method has been recently improved and suggested for decomposition of chlorine-containing compounds. In this improved method, for increasing the velocity of decomposition reaction, the chlorine-containing compounds are dissolved in an alcohol solvent which contains an alkaline metal material, and ultraviolet rays are used to irradiate that solution. In this reaction system, the chloride compound, i.e. hydrogen chloride produced by the decomposition reaction, forms a salt with the alkaline metal in the solution, and the salt is precipitated and removed from the solution. Accordingly, hindrance of the decomposition reaction by the decomposed product can be prevented.
However, in the above-described ultraviolet irradiation method, the alcohol molecules of the solvent may be transferred to the corresponding aldehyde or ketone form in the reaction system by ultraviolet radiation, and the aldehyde, ketone and the like are polymerized in the presence of the alkaline material in accordance with the aldol condensation reaction. This reaction badly affects the reaction system to make it difficult to repeat the decomposition operation. Therefore, this method is poor in practice.
