[0010] So as to reduce the on-board weight of the aircraft, there is a tendency to use composite materials.
[0011] A first variant embodiment of a door frame made of composite material consists in making a first subassembly that comprises the edge frame, the secondary frame, and the intercostal ribs. The production of this subassembly in a single piece requires a complex device. Furthermore, the assembly with a composite material skin requires the use of wedges because of the contraction of the skin achieved from pre-impregnated folds that lead to greatly increasing the assembly time.
[0012] Another variant embodiment of a door frame made of composite material consists in independently producing all of the elements in composite material and then in assembling them like elements of a metal door frame. However, this solution is not satisfactory because the production of parts made of composite material in an economical manner induces dimensional tolerance problems during the docking of different parts. Finally, the assembly according to the same architecture as the metal parts (edge frame, secondary frame, intercostal ribs) of the elements made of composite material does not make it possible to optimize the uptake of forces because of the poor response of the parts made of composite material to the forces applied outside of the planes of the folds forming said parts.
[0013] Also, the purpose of this invention is to eliminate the drawbacks of the prior art by proposing a frame for an opening provided in an aircraft fuselage, whose architecture optimizes the uptake of forces. According to another objective, the architecture should make it possible to simplify the production of the frame in composite material.
[0014] For this purpose, the invention has as its object a frame of a door that is provided at an opening made in a fuselage of an aircraft that is delimited by a skin, whereby said frame that comprises an upper longitudinal stiffener and a lower longitudinal stiffener provides the connection between two vertical substructures that are arranged on both sides of the opening, at the level of which there is provided at least one stop that provides the uptake of radial forces exerted by the door, characterized in that each vertical substructure comprises at least three walls made of composite material that are connected to one another to form a closed and hollow profile in such a way as to obtain a box structure.
