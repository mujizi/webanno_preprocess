The present invention relates to the art of in vivo bone treatment. It finds particular application to in vivo bone transport and lengthening and will be described with particular reference thereto.
Intercalary defects in long bones may occur as a result of trauma, resection necessitated by tumors or infection, or acute limb lengthening. With appropriate mechanical fixation, these defects may be managed by autogenous bone grafting, segmental allograft reconstruction, or reconstruction using endoprostheses. Autogenous bone grafting has the disadvantage of donor site morbidity including pain, increased blood loss, and surgical scarring. Furthermore, in the case of large defects it may be difficult or impossible to obtain an optimal volume of autogenous bone. While allografting eliminates the problem of adequate quantity, the incidence of complications such as infection, fracture, and non-union is increased. The risk of exposure to HIV or hepatitis is another concern, raised by the use of allogenous material, bone or transfusion blood to treat bleeding.
In 1954, Ilizarov reported that mature bone can be elongated by gradual distraction of a fracture callus and called this process distraction osteogenesis. The application of this technique in the form of bone segment transport or gradual bone lengthening can obviate the need for open bone grafting in many large diaphyseal defects. Ilizarov used external fixation, with wires passing through the limb and bone, and connected to the external frame. However, transfixing wires used in this technique can cause significant complications including wire site infection, bone infection, pain, scarring, and restricted joint motion due to the transfixation of tendons and muscles. These complications are particularly relevant when the Ilizarov device is applied to the femur.
In 1990, Brunner reported that distraction osteogenesis was achievable using intramedullary fixation in sheep tibiae. Brunner's method still relied on the use of an external fixator to provide the force necessary for bone transport. Brunner's work implied that transfixing wires used for internal fixation could potentially be eliminated.
Betz described the use of a telescoping intramedullary rod for distraction osteogenesis. With the Betz device, the patient apparently turned a small knob that protruded from the patient's hip in order to telescopically move the parts relative to one another.
