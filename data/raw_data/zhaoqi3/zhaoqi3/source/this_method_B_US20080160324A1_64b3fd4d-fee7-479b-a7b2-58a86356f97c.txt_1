[0059]FIG. 7 shows an example in which the production method of the first embodiment is applied to a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Each of striped sheets 10 used in this example has a structure in which first layers 11 made of a fuel electrode material (unfired) and second layers 12 made of a removable material that is removed by firing are stacked. Sheets made of the fuel electrode material are used as the homogeneous sheets 13. A biaxial stack 14 is produced using the striped sheets 10 and the homogeneous sheets 13 made of the fuel electrode material. The biaxial stack 14 is then fired to produce a ceramic structure 17 made of the fuel electrode material and having a honeycomb structure. The openings of through-holes 16 of the resulting ceramic structure 17 are masked in a checkered pattern. Subsequently, the ceramic structure 17 is dipped in a slurry containing an unfired solid electrolyte material and then fired. Furthermore, the ceramic structure 17 is then dipped in a slurry containing an unfired air electrode material and then fired. Finally, the mask is removed to produce an SOFC stack 40 in which unit cells (elements) of the SOFC are arrayed in a matrix shape. In this SOFC stack 40, through-holes 16 that have been masked constitute fuel gas channels F and through-holes 16 that have not been masked constitute air channels A. On each of the air channels A, a fuel electrode material layer 41, a solid electrolyte material layer 42, and an air electrode material layer 43 are stacked in that order. In this SOFC stack 40, a unit cell (element) includes a single air channel A, four fuel gas channels F surrounding the air channel A, and the layers 41, 42, and 43 disposed therebetween. An example of the solid electrolyte material is zirconia (such as 3YSZ or 8YSZ). An example of the air electrode material is lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM). An example of the fuel electrode material is Ni-YSZ cermet. In the above example, each the first layers 11 of the striped sheets 10 is formed as the fuel electrode material layer. Alternatively, the first layer 11 may be formed as the solid electrolyte material layer or the air electrode material layer. When the first layer 11 is formed as the solid electrolyte material layer, the fuel electrode material layer is formed on one wall surface of the adjacent through-holes 16, and the air electrode material layer is formed on the other wall surface thereof. When the first layer 11 is formed as the air electrode material layer, the solid electrolyte material layer and the fuel electrode material layer are formed on one wall surface of the adjacent through-holes 16, and no additional layer is formed on the other wall surface thereof.
[0060]In FIG. 7, the description has been made of the case in which the ceramic structure 17 having a honeycomb structure is applied to a SOFC. Alternatively, a microfilter may be produced by filling the through-holes of the ceramic structure 17 having a honeycomb structure with a filter material in a checkered pattern. Such a microfilter may be produced by the following method. Specifically, a uniaxial stack 20 is formed by stacking units each including a raw material sheet made of a removable material, a raw material sheet made of a structural material (material that is not removed by firing), a raw material sheet made of a filter material (material that is formed into a filter material by firing), and a raw material sheet made of the structural material. The uniaxial stack 20 is then cut to prepare striped sheets 10. The striped sheets 10 and homogeneous sheets 13 made of the structural material are alternately stacked to form a biaxial stack, and the biaxial stack is fired. In this case, the microfilter can be produced at one time after firing.
[0061]FIG. 8 shows an example in which the production method of the first embodiment is applied to an all-solid-state rechargeable battery 70. As shown in FIG. 8, in order to produce the all-solid-state rechargeable battery 70, a uniaxial stack 60 is formed by stacking units each including a first raw material sheet 61 composed of a positive electrode material tape, a second raw material sheet 62 composed of a solid electrolyte material tape, a third raw material sheet 63 composed of a negative electrode material tape, and the second raw material sheet 62 composed of the solid electrolyte material tape. The uniaxial stack 60 is cut along the stacking direction of the raw material sheets 61 to 63 to prepare striped sheets 50. Each of the striped sheets 50 has a structure in which units each including a first layer 51 made of a positive electrode material, a second layer 52 made of a solid electrolyte material, a third layer 53 made of a negative electrode material, and a second layer 52 made of the solid electrolyte material are stacked. The striped sheets 50 and homogeneous sheets 55 made of a solid electrolyte material are alternately stacked in a direction (Y direction) orthogonal to the stacking direction (X direction) of the layers 51 to 53, thereby preparing a biaxial stack 54. In this case, the striped sheets 50 and the homogeneous sheets 55 are stacked so that the stacking direction of the layers 51 to 53 is oriented in the same direction (X direction) in all the striped sheets 50. In addition, the first layers 51 and the third layers 53 in the striped sheets 50 are arrayed in a checkered pattern along the stacking direction of the striped sheets 50 and the homogeneous sheets 55. The biaxial stack 54 thus prepared is fired, thereby obtaining the all-solid-state rechargeable battery 70. This method can provide the all-solid-state rechargeable battery 70 having a structure in which four negative electrodes face a single positive electrode, with the solid electrolyte therebetween.
