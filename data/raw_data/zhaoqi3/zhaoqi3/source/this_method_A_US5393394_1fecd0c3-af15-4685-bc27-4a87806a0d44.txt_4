In the subsequent reaction steps .beta. to .delta. described before, alcoholates of the alkaline metal exhibits higher reactivity than their hydroxides. The alcoholates can be used in the form of an alcoholic solution which is prepared by dissolving the alkaline:metal in the alcohol solvent. However, preparation of the alcoholic solution requires a large volume of alcohol solvent due to the low solubility of the alcoholate in the alcohol solvent. For the present invention, it is not necessary to add the alcoholate in the form of a solution. A dispersed liquid and a powder of the alcoholate are also usable. An alcoholate compound with an alkoxy group which differs from the alkoxy group of the solvent alcohol can also be used. In view of economical requirements and reactivity in the subsequent reaction steps, the alcoholate powder and dispersion liquid of the alcoholate can be most advantageously utilized.
According to the decomposition method of the present invention, the ultraviolet irradiation step and the alkali treatment step can be repeatedly performed with the same liquid phase reaction system. At this time, it should be noted that the alkaline material must be prevented from remaining in the liquid phase after separation of the salt which is precipitated by addition of the alkaline material. For this purpose, the amount of the alkaline material to be added is appropriately controlled in accordance with the progress of the decomposition reaction. Nevertheless, another possibility still remains that error of measurement may cause alkaline material to remain. For solving this problem, it is proposed that the decomposition method be provided with the step of cleaning the liquid phase after the alkali treatment step.
The alkaline material can be dissolved in water. Accordingly, if water is added to the liquid phase after the alkali treatment step, the remaining alkaline material is dissolved in the added water. Therefore, if the water added to the reaction solution and containing the remaining alkaline material can be again separated from the reaction solution, cleaning of the liquid phase is possible. As a result of research for realizing this cleaning treatment, an excellent method has been found by the present inventors. This method is characterized in that isopropanol is employed as the solvent which composes the liquid phase for the decomposition reaction system.
Ordinarily, isopropanol is soluble in water at any mixing ratio, as well as other alcohol materials. However, isopropanol has a unique characteristic in that, if the water contains an electrolytic material, the isopropanol separates from the water. Accordingly, if isopropanol is used as a solvent in the first stage of the decomposition method, the water added and mixed with the reaction solution after the ultraviolet irradiation step and the alkali treatment step may dissolve the precipitated salts (NaCl, NaF, etc.) and the remaining alkali material dissolved in the reaction solution. Namely, the electrolytic materials are contained in the water, and the water separates from the isopropanol phase. Accordingly, removal of the remaining alkali material can be accomplished by removing the water phase from the isopropanol phase, and cleaning of the isopropanol phase can be almost completely achieved by repeating the water washing a necessary number of times. The obtained isopropanol phase is cleaned so that it can be suitably used for repeating another cycle of the decomposition operation. If water previously containing electrolytic material is used for the cleaning treatment, the separation efficiency can be improved. For example, in the case of sodium chloride, an aqueous solution with a concentration of more than or equal to about 15 wt % gives a clear and speedy separation. Moreover, if the water is appropriately acidified before addition, the waste water after dissolving the remaining alkaline material can be neutralized, resulting in easy after-treatment of the waste water. It is also possible to add the cleaning water in advance of the ultraviolet irradiation step or the alkali treatment step, based on the fact that the presence of water in the reaction solution does not affect the decomposition reaction during the decomposition by irradiation. In this case, the salt produced by addition of the alkali material and the remaining alkali material can be quickly dissolved in the water, and the water dissolving the salt and the like separates from the isopropanol phase in a short time. Therefore, removal of the remaining alkali material can be efficiently achieved.
For performing the decomposition described above in practice, a decomposition apparatus as shown in FIG. 1 can be utilized. The decomposition apparatus basically comprises a decomposition vessel 1 which is equipped with a ultraviolet lamp 3.
