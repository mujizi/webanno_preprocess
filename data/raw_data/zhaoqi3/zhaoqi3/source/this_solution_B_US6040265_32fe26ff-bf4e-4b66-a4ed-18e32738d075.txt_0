One embodiment of this invention is the formation of ceria-containing mixed-metal-oxide promoter compositions having exceptionally small crystallites, generally in the order of about 100 .ANG. or less and preferably about 75 .ANG. or less and particularly, about 50 .ANG. or less. Ceria is currently used as a promoter in many, if not most, TWC catalysts. As thus used, it is thought to function as an oxygen storage agent. When employed as a catalyst promoter, ceria is generally deposited on a support, but it can also be used itself as the support. The mixed-metal-oxide compositions of this invention can similarly be used directly as the support, but it is preferred to deposit them on a separate support.
In prior art methods, the ceria is generally formed in situ by depositing a solution of one or more cerium compounds, for example as cerium nitrate or acetate in water, on powdered support materials such as alumina. The powdered support is then dried and calcined to convert the cerium compound to cerium oxide. Such a procedure typically provides ceria crystallites sized between about 80 and 150 .ANG., or larger.
The ceria-rich mixed-metal-oxide promoter compositions of this invention are formed from solutions of one or more cerium compounds, one or more secondary metal compounds, and one or more suitable organic reagent depositing agents. In such solutions, the metal compounds will comprise about 1 to about 30 wt. %, the organic reagent material will comprise about 2 to about 40 wt. %, and the solvent will make up the remainder. As solvents, water is preferred but others such as alcohol, acetone, and tetrahydrofuran may be employed where appropriate. This solution is suitably mixed with the desired support material and the entire mixture then heated in air or some other suitable atmosphere in the following sequence: First, the material dries to form a highly dispersed, highly uniform, and highly homogeneous mixture of cerium-secondary metal compounds in an organic reagent matrix uniformly coating the support. Upon further heating in air the matrix decomposes, leaving a highly dispersed, homogeneous, and uniform mixed-metal-oxide coating deposited on the support material.
The single step method of this invention can be used to prepare ceria-rich mixed-metal-oxide-promoted catalyst supports such as Zr-doped ceria on .gamma.-Al.sub.2 O.sub.3. Analysis of samples of such supports prepared using the procedure of this invention show significant enhancement of CeO.sub.2 reducibility after aging, thereby making more oxygen available for the resulting catalyst. Several preparations have been shown to give significant performance advantages after engine dynamometer aging.
When ceria-containing mixed-metal oxides are formed on a support in accordance with this invention, uniform distribution, small scale homogeneity and small crystallite sizes of the ceria-rich mixed-metal-oxide promoters (i.e., ceria comprises greater than 50 mole % of the mixed metal oxide) are observed in both the resulting support and the final exhaust conversion catalyst. The uniform distribution, small crystallite size and small scale homogeneity of the ceria-rich, mixed-metal oxides appear to provide superior catalyst performance.
