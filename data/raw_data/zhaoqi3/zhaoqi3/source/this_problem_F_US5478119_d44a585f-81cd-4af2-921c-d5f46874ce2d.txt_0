Each tab 132a, 132b is formed with angled walls 134a, 134b and 136a, 136b, best shown in FIG. 7, to facilitate insertion and removal. During insertion, the male and female connector halves are simply pushed firmly together, and the outer angled walls 136a, 136b of the tabs on the male connector half 12 ride up the angled walls 126a, 126b of the corresponding recesses 122a, 122b in the female connector half 14. The tabs 132a, 132b audibly snap into the openings 124a, 124b. The audible snap aids the user in knowing that the two halves are properly connected. During removal, the male and female connector halves are simply pulled firmly apart, and the inner angled walls 134a, 134b of the tabs 132a, 132b pressing against the side of the openings 124a, 124b force the resilient fingers 128a, 128b inward and allow the tabs 132a, 132b to be pulled out of the openings 124a, 124b. The amount of angle imparted to the angled walls 134a, 134b determines the amount of force required to remove the male connector half from the female connector half. The greater the angle from the axis of the finger is, the more force is required to pull the halves apart. It has been determined that an angle of about 60.degree. from the axis of the finger requires about 10 lbs of force to remove the halves. With this amount of force, the male and female connector halves remain together in use, but may be readily disconnected by pulling firmly on each half. The halves can also be disconnected rapidly in the event of an emergency without any additional steps, such as pressing a release latch, which can hinder rapid disconnection.
As best seen in FIG. 10, each locking finger 128a, 128b is joined at its base to the respective sidewalls 34, 36 and is surrounded on its other sides by the sidewalls separated by a U-shaped space 142. In particular, a bridge or cross piece 144 interconnects the top and bottom sides of the sidewalls to form a more rigid wall. In this manner, the housing 24 is more rigid and less likely to deform by movement of the top and bottom walls 30, 32 toward each other.
In contrast, prior art connectors often employ a locking mechanism having a locking finger which is not fully surrounded by a unitary wall. With such a configuration, the longer walls of each half can be more readily squeezed toward each other, deforming the housing, sometimes to a degree sufficient to defeat the asymmetrical placement of the keys and keyways and force the halves together in the wrong orientation. The present invention alleviates this problem by providing a more rigid, unitary sidewall.
In addition, the locking finger of the present invention is more readily manufacturable. The tooling for molding each connector half has a metal piece which forms the space 142 surrounding the locking finger. In prior art connectors, the space between the walls on each side of the locking finger must be made as narrow as possible, to minimize deformation. The piece forming this space is thus small and tends to fail. In the present invention, the space 142 can be larger, since sidewall rigidity is improved by the presence of the bridge 144. Thus, the molding piece forming the space 142 is larger and less likely to fail.
The connector halves of the present invention are each molded as a single piece. Preferably, the exterior of the halves are formed with generally rounded outer edges. Also, the overall size of the connection device is preferably minimized. In this manner, the connection device is less likely to injure or irritate a patient if the patient lays on or rolls over the device in the bed.
