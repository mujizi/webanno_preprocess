Results
[0135] A schematic of the electrochemical real-time PCR (ERT-PCR) method conducted on a silicon-glass microchip is shown in FIGS. 3B and 3C of this patent. It is important for the successful implementation of on-chip ERT-PCR to make successful readings of accumulative electrochemical signal produced by the increased amount of PCR amplicon at each PCR thermal cycle.
[0136] This method is unlike the ERT-PCR conducted in an Eppendorf.RTM. tube PCR process. See, Yeung, S. W.; Lee, T. M. H.; Hsing, I. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 13374-13375. This on-chip ERT-PCR process involves oligonucleotide extension of solution- and solid-phases in a closed micro-environment, and repetitive electrochemical potential scanning without removal of solution and surface-adsorbed impurities. Several crucial factors, e.g. passivation of the sensing electrode, strategy on the electrochemical scanning, and control of enzyme and oligo probe concentrations, that would greatly affect the analytical signal of this new assay platform are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Electrode Surface Passivation
[0137] One of the biggest challenges in running ERT-PCR in a microchip format is to minimize, if not totally eliminate, the background signal caused by the solution-phase Fc-dUTP. FIG. 4 shows that the background signal is strongly dependent on the duration of the ethanolamine blocking step. Characteristic redox peaks from Fc-dUTP 50 (shown in FIG. 3B) (.about.+0.57 V vs. Pt pseudo reference electrode) are noticeable with blocking time shorter than 3 hours (curve c on FIG. 4), which is likely caused by the nonspecific adsorption of the Fc-dUTP 50 to the unreacted epoxide groups and/or free diffusion of the Fc-dUTP 50 to the ITO surface 34 (shown in FIG. 3B). For a long enough blocking time, i.e., 12 hours (curve d on FIG. 4. 4), the baseline is nearly flat. This implies that almost all the residual epoxide groups are reacted with the ethanolamine so that nonspecific adsorption and diffusional access of the Fc-dUTP 50 to the electrode surface 34 is minimized. With this, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly increased and hence a lower detection limit is expected. When practicing this method, no washing step is required to remove the free soluble markers from the solution and the method, therefore, achieves real-time PCR quantification.
