[0027] However, this is an expensive solution, inasmuch as it presumes the use of two heating elements, two control contacts and two thermostats.
[0028] As an alternative to the solution described above, it should be noticed that the inhibition of the supply to the heating element R2 might be obtained directly through the contact C2 instead of a thermostat; to this purpose, the machine control system (either electromechanical or electronic) will control the opening of the contact C2 after a fixed time since starting the drying program (e.g. 10 minutes), so that during the further program development air heating is ensured by the heating element R1 alone.
[0029] However, also this solution is not a very practical one, since it requires the use of two heating elements, two supply contacts and one thermostat.
[0030] Apart from the type of control employed for the heating element R2, the above solution would not prevent the problem previously mentioned of the cyclicity of intervention of the thermostat T1, should the safety temperature be exceeded.
[0031] The present invention has the aim of solving the drawbacks previously mentioned with reference to the prior art and providing, in particular, a method for drying laundry and a relevant machine being more efficient, more reliable and cheaper than the known solutions.
