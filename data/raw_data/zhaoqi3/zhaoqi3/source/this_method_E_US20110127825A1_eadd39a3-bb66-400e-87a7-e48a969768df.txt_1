[0078] The method may further comprise: h) resuming the injection step or resuming steps (b) and (c). Step (h) may be performed when step (g) is completed.
[0079] The method may further comprise: carrying out any of the previously described step (e), step (f), step (g), step (h), or any combinations thereof.
[0080] Additional embodiments of the solution mining method may comprise a `traveling` undercut which may be an advancing undercut initiated up-dip and traveling down-dip, or a retreating undercut initiated down-dip and traveling up-dip. Applicants thus call this method as a `traveling` undercut solution mining process, because the location of where the solvent is injected at the base of the ore is moved over time, the movement being from down-dip to up-dip or vice versa.
[0081] For a traveling undercut method, the method may further comprise performing any suitable method for changing the location of solvent injection in order to expose fresh ore to the solvent, such as performing at least one of the previously-described steps (g1) and (g2). Step (h) may be carried out until the location of solvent injection reaches an ore region near or at the up-dip lateral edge of the ore bed.
[0082] A seventh embodiment of the present invention relates to a solution counter-reaming method for creating a large cavity within an ore bed containing a mineral solute, and further comprising a roof and a floor. This method may comprise creating a lined portion of a borehole from the surface down up to the ore bed roof at a desired location, preferably within a down-dip region of the ore bed, and further extending the borehole with an unlined portion past the ore bed floor to form a sump in which a downhole pump is installed. The method further comprises drilling a small borehole by directional drilling from the surface to travel more horizontally, above the ore floor, within a region of the ore bed (preferably a down-dip region) until the sump is reached. The method further comprises inserting a conduit inside the small borehole and spraying high-pressure unsaturated solvent in all directions from the downhole end of the conduit to allow dissolution of mineral solute, thereby increasing the size of the borehole (e.g., increased cross-sectional area) and forming a cavity; retracting or perforating the conduit within the unlined borehole portion embedded in the ore bed; and repeating the solvent passing and spraying steps to continue the dissolution of the solute and to enlarge the formed cavity. This enlarged cavity may serve as the collection zone which is employed in some embodiments of the traveling undercut solution mining method and system of the present invention. The ore bed may be a virgin trona bed, and the solvent may comprise water such as an aqueous solution unsaturated in sodium values, or may be water.
