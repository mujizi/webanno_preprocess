[0152] Where the tank contains a multiple-liquid layer height profile 810 as shown in FIG. 7, a similar procedure may thereafter be used to determine the respective heights of any stratified immiscible liquid sublayers. That is, referring to FIG. 7, once the liquid layer height L2 has been determined in accordance with the procedure of FIG. 10, a similar procedure as at block 440 might be employed, except that it would be the liquid-liquid interface between liquid A and liquid B rather than the air-liquid interface that would be found. Whereas the air layer was taken to be the known layer and the liquid layer was taken to be the unknown layer at the example in the flowchart of FIG. 10, in the present case one of the liquid sublayers would be taken to be the known layer and the other liquid sublayer would be taken to be the unknown layer. That is, the dielectric constant of the sublayer that is taken to be the known layer may be set at the set module 284 if known in advance or may be measured by the impedance-based module 222 or the time-based module 224 under the control of the measure module 286. For purposes of the present description it will be assumed that the dielectric constant .di-elect cons.2B of the bottommost sublayer (liquid B) has been set or measured in this fashion. The liquid B sublayer thus becomes the known layer, and the liquid A sublayer becomes the unknown layer.
[0153] Thereafter, a procedure similar to that described with reference to block 450 might be employed, except that it would be the time domain length of the liquid B sublayer that would be measured. In a procedure similar to that at block 455, the convert module 226 would then use the dielectric constant .di-elect cons.2B of the liquid B sublayer to convert the time domain length (height) of the liquid B sublayer to a (space domain) height L2B for the liquid B sublayer. In a procedure similar to that at block 460, the unknown layer module 288 would then derive the height L2A of the liquid A sublayer from the known liquid layer height L2 and the measured height L2B of the liquid B sublayer.
[0154] At this time, because TDR was not employed to directly measure the height L2A of the liquid A sublayer but the height L2A of the liquid A sublayer was instead derived from the known liquid layer height L2 and the measured height L2B of the liquid B sublayer, this method can be said to be insensitive to the dielectric constant .di-elect cons.2A of the liquid A sublayer.
[0155] Where there are more than two stratified liquid sublayers, this process can be repeated in iterative fashion to successively measure any number of sublayers.
[0156] In one variation, to achieve even greater spatial resolution, sweep offset and gain may be optimized not only for collection of samples substantially within the region bounded by the probe top and the probe bottom as described above with reference to FIG. 3, but such optimization of sweep offset and gain may progressively target narrower subregions with each successive iteration as will be described below.
