[0002] Flat knitted fabrics such as, for example, bandages, are usually knitted on a flat knitting machine. Such a knitted fabric has a firm initial border and a firm border at the right and left sides. However, at the end of the flat knitted fabric are unsecured stitches, i.e., open stitches, which must be secured individually and in a very time consuming process by linking at the knitting machine. Alternatively, the end of the knitted fabric can in this border region also be cleaned and secured at the border area, for example, by a protective ribbon to be sewn on; this takes place in a separate manual procedure. In other words, the measures to be taken for securing the end of the knitted fabric are complicated and time consuming, resulting in significant costs.
[0003] Accordingly, the invention is based on the problem of indicating a method which makes it possible in a simple manner to secure the stitches at the fabric end while simultaneously forming an attractive border.
[0004] For solving this problem, it is provided in a method for manufacturing a flat knitted fabric on a flat knitting machine with front and rear needle beds that initially the basic knitted fabric is knitted on one or both needle beds, wherein in the border area of the fabric at least on the needle bed forming the inner side of the fabric an elastic thread is knitted in, and wherein, for forming the border, knitting is carried out only on the needle bed which stitches the outer side so that the elastic thread located on the other needle bed is extended, and subsequently the stitches are knitted off, wherein the border is pulled onto the inner side of the fabric due to the fact that the elastic thread contracts when the load is removed therefrom, wherein it is subsequently fixed by the hot melt adhesive thread onto at least one needle bed in the basic fabric or onto the border.
[0005] The method according to the invention makes it possible, on the one hand, to securely fix the stitches by gluing by means of a hot melt adhesive thread, while, on the other hand, as a result of the quasi automatic folding over of the border by the previously extended elastic thread which contracts when the load is removed, an optically pleasing and clean border is formed which rests comfortably against the wearer. For this purpose, pursuant to the invention, initially the basic fabric is knitted on one or both needle beds. It is only necessary to form the border area. Thus, at least one elastic thread is knitted in on at least the needle bed forming the inner side of the fabric, but possibly also on both needle beds. Subsequently, for forming the border, the fabric is further knitted, however, only on the needle bed which is knitting the outer side of the fabric. Accordingly, a quasi single-layer fabric is knitted, while no further knitting is carried out on the other needle bed which previously knitted the inner side of the fabric. However, at that location, there is still on the needles the elastic thread which, after the outer side of the fabric is knitted on the other needle bed, is inevitably extended, i.e., the thread is tensioned. If a sufficient border piece has been knitted in the needle bed which knits the outer side of the fabric in order to connect the stitches of both sides, at least one machine row is knitted off, i.e., both stitches (border stitches and elastic thread stitches) are fixed to each other. When the fabric is removed, the border section which has been knitted as a single layer inevitably folds over to the inner side of the fabric after the tensioned elastic thread contracts inevitably when the load is removed and, due to the connection with the border knitted stitches takes the stitches along as a result of knitting and pulls them to the inner side of the fabric. In other words, quasi overlapping layers are now present at the inner side of the fabric. Previously, a hot melt adhesive thread has been knitted in on at least one of the needle beds, possibly also on both. Such a hot melt adhesive thread conventionally is based on a polyamide or polyester, accordingly, a thermoplastic material which melts when heated and solidifies once again during cooling. Since, after conversion in the overlapping area, also the adhesive thread is in the overlapping area, a simple heating and compressing makes possible a fixing of the folded-over border in the region of the basic fabric on the inner side of the fabric.
[0006] Due to the folding over onto the inner side of the fabric, the last row of stitches is not visible from the outer side of the fabric, so that an optically pleasing and clean fabric border area is formed. Because fixing is effected through the hot melt adhesive thread, it is additionally possible to fix the folded-over border as well as the stitches themselves, i.e., the end of the fabric is secured against dropped stitches. By knitting-in the elastic thread, the border moreover has additionally a sufficient elasticity which the flat knitted fabric also has over its entire area, for example, when manufacturing a bandage which conventionally has one or more knitted-in, encased elastomer threads so that the folded-over border also rests comfortably against the wearer.
