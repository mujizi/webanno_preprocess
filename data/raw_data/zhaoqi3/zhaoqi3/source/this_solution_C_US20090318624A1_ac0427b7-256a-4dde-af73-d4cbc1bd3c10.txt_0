5.4 Example 3
[0171] This example involved re-ionization of an isolated and purified PIB sample carrying tert-chloride end groups. The quencher was ethoxytrimethylsilane.
[0172] The tert-chloride-terminated PIB was produced according to the following procedure: A stirred 1000 mL glass reactor was immersed into a -75.degree. C. constant-temperature heptane/hexane bath within the glove box. Into the flask were charged 654.5 mL MeCl, 6.12 mL (0.036 mol, 0.045 M) TMPCl, 0.58 mL (4.9 mmol, 0.0062 M) 26Lut, 97.2 mL (1.2 mol, 1.5 M) IB, and 41.6 mL (0.53 mol, 0.68 M) BCl.sub.3 (neat). The polymerization reaction reached high conversion of the IB (.about.99%) in about 5 h, at which time the reaction was terminated by careful addition of excess, prechilled MeOH. The terminated reaction mixture was transferred to a 10000 mL beaker, and the solvents were allowed to evaporate overnight. The polymer and remaining non-volatiles were diluted with hexane and were washed several times with MeOH and slightly acidified water. The polymer solution was stirred over MgSO.sub.4 in order to remove any residual water, and the polymer was isolated by filtration and dried at room temperature in a vacuum oven. The theoretical M.sub.n for the masterbatch polymer was 2,049 g/mol and GPC-MALLS analysis of the product using a dn/dc of 0.110 yielded M.sub.n=1,890 g/mol and M.sub.w/M.sub.n=1.01. A stock solution of the masterbatch polymer was created by dissolving 9.54 g of the polymer in 60 mL hexane. The molar concentration of this solution was 0.067 mol/L, based on the theoretical M.sub.n of the polymer.
NMR analysis of the end group composition (%) yielded the following:
