During discharge (i.e., regeneration) of cell 475, such as by shorting conductive plates 480 and 485 or periodic polarization reversal, resin coatings 483 and 489 are regenerated, and protons and hydroxyl ions are liberated from interfaces 490 and 492, respectively. These protons and hydroxyl ions displace the cations and anions (M.sub.1.sup.+, M.sub.2.sup.+ and X.sup.-, Y.sup.-) into a regeneration solution, such as water having the same composition as the feed stream.
Although the present ionization of cell 475 and process of use minimizes, if not completely eliminates, the reliance on chemical regenerants, such regenerants can still be effectively utilized during regeneration in either the stopped-flow mode or the slow-flow mode and further in combination with the shorting of the electrodes or during polarization reversal. Cell 475 can be used for deionizing boiler water for ships and power plants, for fossil-fired and nuclear power plants, for the treatment of mixed and hazardous wastes, for domestic and industrial water softening, for the analysis and treatment of body fluids including blood dialysis, and for several other applications.
Cell 475 also enables the selective, simultaneous separation of cations and ions in a fluid or aqueous solution, with the same selectivity known for the ion exchange resin used as a coating. In the present illustration, this solution contains anions X.sup.- and Y.sup.-, and cations M.sub.1.sup.+ and M.sub.2.sup.+. As the solution starts flowing through central channel 478 certain anions and cations, i.e., X.sup.- and M.sub.1.sup.+, respectively, saturate the proximal segment 494 of electrodes 477 and 476. As the resin coatings 489 and 483 in this proximal segment 494 become saturated, the remaining anions and cations, i.e., Y.sup.- and M.sub.2.sup.+ begin to saturate the distal segment 495 of electrodes 477 and 476. Ionic selectivities of the ion exchange resins, and hence the electrochemically-regenerated ion exchange (ERIE) process, are established by the relative coulombic attraction between various dissolved ions and the oppositely charged functional groups. The force of attraction is determined by the size, configuration, and charge of both the ions and the functional groups.
Thus this capacitive deionization system and method present significant improvements and advantages over other technologies. For instance, unlike ion exchange, acids, bases, or salt solutions, although optional for improved results, are not required for regeneration embodiments of the system. Regeneration is accomplished by electrically discharging or reversing polarization of the cells as well as providing static or slow-flow conditions. Therefore, no secondary waste is generated. Since no membranes or high pressure pumps are required, the present system offers operational advantages over electrodialysis and reverse osmosis. It is more energy efficient than competing technologies, and is substantially more energy efficient than thermal processes.
The present system can also be used to treat brackish water (800 to 3200 ppm), which is very important, particularly to coastal communities. Competing technologies for the treatment of brackish water are electrodialysis and reverse osmosis. Such typical processes can consume about 7.7 Wh/gal and about 5.3 to 8.5 Wh/gal, respectively. The present system can be much more energy efficient, and may require less than 1 Wh/gal, possibly 0.2-0.4 Wh/gal, depending upon energy recovery, cell geometry, and operation. The theoretical minimum energy for removal of ions from brackish water , based upon thermodynamics, is approximately 0.1 Wh/gal. The present system is more highly efficient and can approach this value.
