[0012] Radiation based well logging, as an alternative to contact resistivity based systems, generally involves either the measurement of natural radiation from the geologic structures intersecting the borehole, or a responsive measurement made after a radioactive source is lowered into the borehole. In either case, measurements of radiation are made and an interpretation of the various levels of the different types of radiation is used to indicate the nature of the structures immediately adjacent to the well logging device. A gamma ray log is considered primarily a shale--locating log while neutron logs provide information on the lithology and the porosity of the formation, thereby characterizing the hydrogen richness of the adjacent formations.
[0013] Radiation logs are generally nondirectional in the sense that no specific orientation within the borehole is determined and only a depth of the formation measurement is associated with the radiation measurement.
[0014] Resistivity and conductivity logging, as discussed above, have serious limitations. Resistivity and conductivity logging are, for example, ineffective in metal cased boreholes. Consequently owners of older, depleted wells lack dependable logs run prior to completion and often lack other adequate drilling records. These older wells are therefore at a loss to determine at what depth they could tap potential oil producing strata before abandoning their wells. Radioactive well logging, in part, is intended to address this problem.
[0015] The equipment necessary for a radiation based well log is relatively straightforward. As with dip log methods described above, logging is completed during the upward trip of a wire line tool in order to maintain tautness and to insure that the entire length of cable is under proper tension. Registration of the radioactivity measurements is generally accomplished at the surface in an instrument truck containing the necessary amplification and recording equipment. Signals within the tool are converted to suitable electrical signal form and are either recorded or transmitted up the wire line for analysis. The signal analysis process identifies deflections along the horizontal axis of a chart that measures the intensity against the depth (into the ground) within the borehole. Two or more radioactivity logging curves may be recorded simultaneously in this manner.
[0016] All applicable radiation detectors produce signals that are unsuitable for direct transmission over the hoisting cable, the subsurface equipment necessarily contains some amplifying or signal conversion devices. This in turn requires electrical power for operation that must be supplied through the cable from the surface.
