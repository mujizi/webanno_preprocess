A polymer spinning solution was prepared in a continuous polymerization process by reacting metaphenylene diamine with isophthaloyl chloride. A solution of one part metaphenylene diamine dissolved in 9.71 parts of DMAc was metered through a cooler into a mixer into which 1.88 parts of molten isophthaloyl chloride was simultaneously metered. The mixed was proportioned and the combined flow of the reagents was selected to result in turbulent mixing. The molten isophthaloyl chloride was fed at about 60.degree. C. and the metaphenylene diamine was cooled to about -15.degree. C. The reaction mixture was directly introduced into a jacked, scrapped-wall heat exchanger having a length to diameter ratio of 32 and proportioned to give a hold-up time of about 9 minutes. The heat exchanger effluent flowed continuously to a neutralizer into which was also continuously added 0.311 lb. of calcium hydroxide for each pound of polymer in the reaction solution. The neutralized polymer solution was heated under vacuum to remove water and concentrate the solution. The resulting polymer solution was the polymer spin solution and used in the spinning process described below.
This polymer spin solution had an inherent viscosity of 1.55 as measured in 4.0% lithium chloride in DMAc. The polymer concentration in this spinning solution was 19.3% by weight. The spin solution also contained 9.0% by weight calcium chloride and about 1% by weight water. The concentration of the DMAc was 70.7% by weight.
This solution was placed in a dope pot and heated to approximately 90.degree. C. and then fed by way of a metering pump and filter through a spinneret having 250 holes of 50.8 microns (2 mils) diameter. The spinning solution was extruded directly into a coagulation solution that contained by weight 15% DMAc, 40% calcium chloride and 45% water. The coagulation solution was maintained at about 110.degree. C.
The fiber bundle exiting the coagulation solution was wound on a first roll (6 of FIG. 4) having a speed of 329.2 m/h (18 ft/m). A conditioning solution containing by weight 41.1% DMAc, 9.5% calcium chloride and 49.4% water was sprayed on the fiber bundle wetting each individual filament as the fiber bundle was wound from the first roll to a secondary roll (8 of FIG. 4) at a speed of 347.5 m/hr (19 ft/m). The conditioning solution was at 36.degree. C.
The filaments exiting the secondary roll were run through a wet draw section; the drawing solution contained by weight 20% DMAc and 80% water. The temperature of the drawing solution was 36.degree. C.
