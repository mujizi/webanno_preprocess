[0088] Alternatively, charging of the source using a method with parasitic power acceptance is also conceivable, in which, for example, mechanical movements, that the garment experiences as a result of movements by the user or his body heat, are used to win energy. Apart from this it is possible to use solar cells for the energy supply.
[0089] As already mentioned a number of times, the transformers can transmit not only electrical energy for energy supply, but also electrical signals for transfer of information. This can on the one hand be information that is sent and received by the control units C and is used for organization of the distributed system from FIG. 12. On the other hand, however, information can also be exchanged between the devices of the system, for example data from a mobile phone to an organizer, or audio signals of an audio player to a headset integrated into the collar of the jacket. In particular--as described above--it is particularly useful to carry out the regulation of the excitation frequency for the respective primary induction element via a means for transfer of information. Thus the secondary circuit can transfer the measured value for the respective induced voltage or the system deviation form a setpoint in the primary circuit, so that the primary excitation frequency can be adjusted accordingly.
[0090] The transmission of information likewise takes place in a wireless manner, preferably to the same points to which the energy transmission also took place. Here very different devices and methods can be used. Firstly a corresponding modulation of the supply voltages transmitted via the transformers T is possible. Here on the primary side a corresponding modulator and on the secondary side a corresponding demodulator are envisaged. Because of the variable magnetic coupling, in particular at a regulated transmission frequency, however, very strong interference may be expected, so that this solution will only be used in a very few suitable cases. Another possibility for signal transmission is represented by radio transmission. Because of the possible interference and the switching excursion, however, this is again not a preference.
[0091] Information transmission is therefore proposed either via an additional inductive coupling or a capacitive coupling. In an additional inductive coupling additional induction elements on the primary and secondary sides that are specially intended for information transmission are provided for. These are designed or arranged in such a way that the information transmission is independent of the energy transmission and the fewest possible faults occur.
[0092] This can be achieved by a special design of the induction elements. For example, when an axial-field-winding in accordance with FIG. 8 is used for the energy transmission and an axial-radial-field winding in accordance with FIG. 9 for the information transmission, the respective fields generated from these are largely independent, so that the two transmissions affect each other only slightly. Other combinations of orthogonal inductor topologies will be known to the expert.
