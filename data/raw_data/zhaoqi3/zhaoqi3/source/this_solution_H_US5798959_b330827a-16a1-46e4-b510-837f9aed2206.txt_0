(b) for any one line affected by the transition, the output of the respective XOR gate switches the T1 switch in series with the control gate of the passgate, on a node onto which a slow ramp signal generated by a dedicated controlled ramp generator develops.
Depending on the type of gate to be driven (for example the control gate of the NMOS transistor or that of the PMOS transistor of a passgate) and depending on the type of the transition of the respective output of the decoder (for example the opening or closing of a passgate) a positive or negative voltage ramp is selected by the use of a second switch T2. The n-bit latch block, in cascade to the decoder, stores the value that preexisted before the contingent (new) switching for the whole duration of the switching ramp, being ultimately updated by the closing of the switch T1 on the respective decoder output.
According to this solution, as referred to in the above described sample application, the circuit block that has to be interposed in cascade connection, between the n-bit latch circuit and the n-output decoder needed for driving in a slowed down manner the passgates affected by the switching, requires a number of components that may be calculated with the following expression:
n.sub.latch +n(n.sub.xor +n.sub.switch +n.sub.inverter)=30*n+4
