The oxidizing solution may likewise be provided in the form of a suitable dispersion, suspension, emulsion, or the like depending upon the solubility characteristics of the monomer employed. This can be readily achieved by the use of suitable suspending agents, emulsifying agents, etc., the particular adjuvants effective for such purposes being well known in the art. Actually, the form in which the monomer is provided is of secondary importance, i.e., emulsion, solution, etc., the primary requirement being that such material be available for reaction with the reduced keratin substrate. To this end the monomer may be provided in a variety of forms so long as such conditions be conducive to efficient monomer-substrate contacting.
The proportions of monomer and catalyst employed in preparing the oxidizing solution are not critical factors in the practice of the present invention. Thus, it is only necessary that the monomer material be employed in amounts sufficient to permit realization of the desired degree of reaction with the keratin substrate; correlatively, the concentration of catalyst material need only be that sufficient to impart the desired reaction rate. Thus, the monomer concentration would be increased in those instances wherein a substantial extent of reduction is desired; conversely monomer requirements may be reduced where lesser degrees of reduction are desired. It will be understood that in those instances wherein the monomer material is provided in liquid form e.g., methyl methacrylate, the oxidizing solution may comprise simply the monomer and catalyst. Thus, the monomer material may be employed in concentrations ranging from as little as 1 percent to as high as about 99 percent and preferably from about 5 to about 30 percent by weight of total oxidizing solution. The amount of catalyst material may likewise vary within wide limits, within a mole ratio range of catalyst to monomer of from about 0.001 to 1 to about 5:1 with a range 1:8 to 1:2 being preferred. Within the foregoing range the particular amount selected will depend upon numerous factors including, for example, the reactivity of the monomer material, the concentration of the latter, the extent of thiol conversion desired, and the like. In any event, determination of optimum parameters in this regard can be readily determined in a particular circumstance by routine investigation.
In general, the duration of the oxidizing solution treatment may range from up to about 30 minutes up to about 2 hours whereby to achieve substantial modification of the keratin material. In any event, it is found in the vast majority of instances that oxidizing periods on the order of 30 minutes suffice to permit the desired reaction. Again, the optimum reaction time in a particular circumstance will depend upon the reactivity of the monomer component, the degree of modification desired in the keratinous substrate, etc. However, one of the important aspects of the aforedescribed process resides in the fact that beneficial results may be obtained when carrying the oxidizing treatment out under room temperature conditions. In contradistinction, prior art methods heretofore promulgated in the treatment of keratinous substrates invariably require the employment of relatively extreme temperature, i.e., on the order of at least 60.degree. C., in order to obtain the desired degree of substrate modification within treatment intervals consonant with efficacious commercial practice. Thus, one of the truly surprising aspects of this process attached to the discovery that effective modification of the keratin material under treatment may be obtained despite the use of exceptionally mild temperature conditions, i.e., room temperature, and treatment intervals on the order of only 30 minutes in duration. The significance of this particular aspect becomes abundantly clear when it is realized that the possibility of damage to the keratinous substrate increases considerably as the treatment conditions become more severe and particularly as the temperature is increased. Thus, in the case of garments constituted in whole or in part of keratinous substances, one or more properties of the garment material may be deleteriously affected in the event of subjection to prolonged treatment under the conditions prescribed according to prior art methods. In contradistinction, the relatively mild temperatures characterizing the process described herein involves little or no risk of damage to the keratinous material selected for treatment.
Another suitable process is a one-step process which involves treating the keratin substrate with a composition comprising
1. a free radical liberating peroxide initiator material capable of initiating the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated vinyl monomer compounds, said initiator being selected from the group consisting of persulfuric acid and salified derivatives thereof including salts with water solubilizing cations, e.g., alkali metal such as sodium, potassium, etc., ammonium, substituted ammonium, i.e., wherein one or more hydrogen atoms is replaced by alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, etc., and
