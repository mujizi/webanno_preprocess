[0019] Another object of the invention consists in the front opening of the vaporiser comprising a tube that is produced as a single unit in the vaporiser itself and that can be slotted into a corresponding orifice in the plate, which tube incorporates an external, immovable watertight gasket that acts between the said vaporiser and plate, and that is made of a material that is suitable for working under compression and at high temperatures. With this solution, only a single gasket is provided which does not function as a separator but rather as a compression piece. This provision accordingly utilizes a gasket made of a fluoro-elastomeric material which works better under compression than silicone and, in addition, is very tolerant of high temperatures. Furthermore, the coupling of the vaporiser to the plate is direct (does not require the use of any additional connection pieces, as does the brass cap) and resists better the stresses imposed by the ironing action and by temperature changes.
[0020] Another feature of the invention consists in that the thermostatic temperature-regulating means of the plate and vaporiser consist of primary and secondary thermal probes. It is anticipated that the thermal probes to be used are NTC (sensors also called NTC-Negative Temperature Coefficient thermistors) which are highly sensitive and have a rapid response time when compared with traditional thermostats that have been used until now. These properties of the thermal probes provide much greater precision and efficiency that will be reflected in the quality of the ironing when compared with other known domestic steam irons. In this connection, it should be said that resorting to inserting a third backup thermostat connected in series to the vaporiser is known, because, given the delay in response of the principal thermostat of the vaporiser, it becomes necessary to short-circuit this thermostat every time the micro-pump is activated, i.e. water gets in and the vaporiser's element operates immediately, otherwise not all the water is vaporised but, instead, a mixture of steam and water is obtained, whereas an NTC probe is advantageously used as a substitute for these two conventional thermostats (the normal and the subsidiary backup). On the other hand, the use of NTC probes makes the technology of the iron more electronic, and more coherent and compatible with the use of control chips containing computer programmes and display screens in which the relevant information is displayed regarding the condition of the iron and the ironing mode selected.
[0021] Another object of the present invention is that the said holes in the plate are fewer in number and are concentrated in the front section of the plate in the shape of an arrow head, and that they have the special feature that they open into certain grooves that extend to the rear section of the plate in the form of channelling grooves. With this solution, humidification of the garment is achieved by the front part of the plate, and drying is achieved as it passes down the rest of the plate so that ironing of superior quality is obtained.
[0022] In the light of the above a first object of the present invention is for the existing relationship between the widths of the vaporisation chamber and the plate to be of the order of three quarters, and because the geometry of the said vaporisation chamber is such that its sides are parallel to those of the said plate. This configuration proposed here assumes a considerable and significant increase in the capacity of the vaporisation chamber. At the same time, the greater absolute width of the vaporisation chamber allows the mesh that closes the rear of the vaporisation chamber to be larger. Finally, the lime accumulation capacity is considerably increased so that the useful life of the product is prolonged.
[0023] Another feature being claimed by this subsidiary patent is that the said front opening of the vaporiser comprises a vertical tube whose other open end penetrates an expansion chamber provided in the plate, and which is closed underneath by a sheet that is preferably made of stainless steel and which covers the lower surface of the plate as the element in contact with the garment being ironed. This solution has been demonstrated to be more convenient since the plate is less prone to be subject to possible blockage by lime accumulation.
