[0138] In general, the candidate phrase is randomly assigned to one or more trend analysis agents. Other candidate phrases can also be assigned to agents for analysis although typically, an agent is assigned one phrase to analyze at a time (e.g., until it is determined whether evaluation threshold was reached for the phrase). In addition, the candidate phrase is typically assigned to an agent that is of a "first state" (e.g., when an evaluation threshold has not yet been met).
[0139] In process 706, the candidate phrase is analyzed by each of the one or more trend analysis agents, respectively using the configured type of trending parameter. The analysis process is described with further reference to the example of FIG. 8.
[0140] In process 708, it is determined by each of the trend analysis agents, whether the candidate phrase meets an associated threshold to qualify as a potential trended phrase. At this stage, whether the trended phrase is weak or strong can also be determined. This process is illustrated with further reference to the example of FIG. 9.
[0141] In process 710, the candidate phrase is identified as the trended phrase based on a number of trend analysis agents assigned to analyze the candidate phase that are in the second state. After a trended phrase has been identified, additional filtering processes can be performed to further verify the validity that a trended phrase corresponds to a trend. An example of a process for using a search filter to verify an identified trend is illustrated in FIG. 10. In detecting an identified trend, trended feeds having content related to the actual trend can be presented as having a higher priority in the hosted interface. The trended phrases can also be indicated as such on the hosted interface and may be selectable, as illustrated in the example screenshot of FIG. 4.
[0142] FIG. 8 depicts a flow chart showing an example process for analyzing candidate phrases using trend analysis agents. This process is also illustrated in an example diagram shown in FIG. 5.
