[0004] In recent years, a video image distribution system, in which a video image taken by a camera is distributed through a network and a monitoring system, in which an indoor or outdoor predetermined monitoring zone is monitored using a camera are becoming widespread. In addition, a network camera having a server function connectable to a network and a set-top box for connecting the camera to the network are commercialized. Such the network camera is generally referred to as the "camera server", and there is known a camera server having a function of detecting a change of an image (resulting from a situation where, for instance, a suspicious person has entered into a predetermined monitoring zone) and activating a warning apparatus.
[0005] With the conventional technique described above, however, a client connected to the camera server through a network is arranged at a place remote from the camera server, so when multiple parameters of a tracking function of the camera are set, it is difficult to know the degree of influence of the parameter change on tracking process of the camera. One conceivable factor of this problem is, for instance, that an actual tracking target portion in a monitoring area is not displayed when the tracking function parameters are set on a client side.
[0006] The present invention has been made in order to solve the problem described above and has an object to provide a system which makes it possible to easily make a setting of a tracking function of a camera at a setting client.
[0007] In order to attain at least one object such as described above, in an embodiment of the present invention, in a setting window, an image display window is displayed in which a photographed or captured image sent from a camera server and an indicator indicating a change detection maximum area as a detection result of image change detection process by the camera server are superimposingly displayed. In addition, in the setting window, a setting window for setting a tracking method by referring to an image displayed in the image display window is displayed. With this construction, it becomes possible to make the setting of the tracking function of the camera with ease.
