[0004] 2. Background
[0005] There is a growing tendency to recycle waste paper as a source of feedstock for the manufacture of paper products. However, it is very difficult to process certain paper products such as polymer or plastic coated paper products. Examples of such products include milk cartons, ice cream containers, glossy papers, coated boards and the like. Older conventional processes are not only expensive but also may be environmentally unfriendly as they can result in additional undesirable waste products that need to be disposed of.
[0006] Relatively new technologies have attempted to address some of these problems. For example, in an article by H. Mamers entitled "The Siropulper--a new concept in wastepaper recovery" (APPITA, vol. 32, No. 2, pp. 124-128, September, 1978), the use of an explosive release digester is described for defibering purposes which may be used in connection with de-inking. The article suggests that hydrodynamic forces of the explosive discharge combine with the chemical effects of a thermal treatment process to release the ink particles from the fibers, reducing the chemical demand of the process. The pressure increase to achieve the required hydrodynamic conditions is effected by injecting pressurized inert gas into a reactor or digester. Although this method appears to have addressed several of the disadvantages of earlier recycle methods, this method still does not produce the product of desired quality, especially as to its appearance, since it produces darker product. Similarly, various other processes have been developed specifically to address environmental and economic concerns in the processing of waste paper products. One such process is generally known as the drum pulping method, which, however, is not very effective as the moisture used in this process can not effectively defiber the waste paper. In addition, the particle sizes of residual contaminants in waste paper furnish produced by this method are generally not acceptable.
[0007] Still more recently, a joint development by Wisconsin Tissue Mills and Stake Technology Ltd. was described in a paper entitled "Steam Explosion Technology and Fiber Recycling" presented at a TAPPI conference in March of 1991. The system described in that paper and related literature includes a digesting chamber where high temperature and pressure are maintained throughout the dwell time, following which the treated waste paper materials are discharged into air at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The paper lists three runs in which the temperature range was 190.degree. C. to 203.degree. C., the dwell time was four minutes, and the pressure was approximately 400 psi. The process is described as resulting in particle sizes of residual contaminants of from 1/2 to {fraction (1/10)} that of the contaminants in waste paper furnish produced by repulping without steam treatment. A major disadvantage of this method is that relatively high temperature and pressure conditions are needed. Explosive decompression of the drum chamber to discharge the furnish is not very desirable. Furthermore, downstream operations involve several steps to clean the pulp including removing the color bodies and other materials.
[0008] It is an object of this invention to further advance the art of recovery of wastepaper and like material and in particular to provide a process for de-inking the waste paper and to remove contaminants from the treated product.
