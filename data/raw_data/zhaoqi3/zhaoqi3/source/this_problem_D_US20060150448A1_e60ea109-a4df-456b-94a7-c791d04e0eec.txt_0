[0001] The present invention generally relates to the connection, protection and support to an electric flatiron power cord, in particular, to an electric flatiron with power cord easily winded up.
BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY
[0002] Electric flatiron or electric iron is commonly used in people's daily lives, but how to roll back the power cord is a great problem that perplexes people. In order to solve this problem, in prior art, a winding apparatus is disposed at the rear of the electric flatiron. This winding apparatus includes a winding box, the central portion of which is a winding shaft which sleeved with a rotor plate used for winding the power cord.
[0003] Wherein, the rotor plate may rotate relatively to the winding shaft. In order to join the electricity, the power cord must be connected to the heating component inside the electric flatiron through the rotor plate and winding shaft, wherein many problems of the electric connection between the components should be considered; in order to enable the winding shaft to roll back the power cord automatically, a coil spring which could force the rotor plate to rotate along the winding direction of the power cord should be set on the winding shaft, meanwhile a clip which could lock the power cord in pulled-out position should also be set, but these components may easily deteriorate when repeatedly used; when pulling the power cord out from the winding apparatus, there should be enough force to overcome the force of the coil spring, and after being released from locked position, the power cord immediately wind back under the force of the coil spring. The process of pulling out and winding back the power cord may easily make related components deteriorate.
[0004] Obviously, the existing winding apparatus of electric flatiron is complex, with high costs, and apt to break down.
