[0063] This general construction is illustrated in FIG. 1, where an object of the invention (see the details shown in this FIG. 1.) is represented, in which the said vaporisation chamber (3) has a rear outlet (11) that communicates with the front opening (4) of the vaporiser (2) by way of a pair of deep channels (12) that are integrated into the vaporiser (2) and extend along the sides to the vaporisation chamber (3) itself. In this manner, the steam generated in the vaporisation chamber (3) passes from there to the rear outlet (11) and proceeds via both channels (12) co-lateral therewith to end by reaching the front opening (4) and arrive at the plate (1) to be expelled through its holes (17). This solution provides better conditions than those currently known for circulating steam, resulting in reduced possibility of blockages due to accumulation of lime and, finally, a better guarantee of adequate and constant supply of steam for a more efficient ironing process.
[0064] In order better to ensure an absence of lime-scale accumulated in the channels (12), and hence also in the front opening (4), another object of the invention consists (FIGS. 1 and 2) in the said rear outlet (11) of the vaporisation chamber (3) being closed by a fixed mesh (13) and which contains a passage conveniently smaller than the channel sections at the front opening (4) and the said channels (12).
[0065] According to another object of the invention (FIGS. 1 and 3) the said front opening of the vaporiser (2) comprises a tube (14) formed entirely in the vaporiser (2) itself and which can be inserted into a corresponding orifice (15) of the plate (1), of which the tube (14) incorporates an external fixed watertight gasket (16) that acts between the said vaporiser (2) and plate (1), and that is made of a material suitable for the compression procedure as well as for high temperatures. As has been explained previously, this solution envisages the use of a gasket of fluoro-elastomeric material which advantageously is a substitute for another known solution which utilizes a separate brass cap that is inserted simultaneously in the vaporiser (2) and the plate (1), together with the alternating placement of each of the silicone gaskets that behave well at high temperatures but do not work well under compression.
[0066] Another object of the invention that is also illustrated in FIG. 1, consists in that the said thermostatic means for regulating the temperature of the plate (1) and the vaporiser (2) comprise thermal sensors, of the plate (7) and the vaporiser (8). As explained above, these thermal sensors (7, 8) provide operation with great precision and speed that avoids the use of a second backup thermostat of conventional type for the vaporiser (2) and provides for the implementation of computer-programmable micro-processors (chips), and of LCD display screens, that show the working stages of the iron at any particular moment, and provides for more efficient and reliable ironing with the greatest accuracy in determining the correct temperature for each type of garment, and for greater speed in producing changes in the ironing temperature.
[0067] Another object of the invention is that the said holes (17) in the plate (1) are provided in a reduced number, concentrated at the front section of the plate (1) in arrow-head formation, and having the special feature of being open within grooves that extend to the rear section of the plate (1) each being in the form of channels (18). In particular, the preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 5 demonstrates that the said holes (17) and channels (18) are seven in number, the three central channels (18) extend to approximately the first third of the length of the plate (1), and the remaining four channels (18) extending to approximately a quarter of the length of the plate (1) measured from the extreme rear end of the plate.
