So far the application of adhesive varnishes results in the highest adhesive power; it is possible to use adhesive varnishes with nearly all compound materials. The mainly used adhesives are heat-reactive and dissolved in organic solvents. The average consumption of adhesives is 12 g/m.sup.2, the quantity of solids being 4 g/m.sup.2 and the quantity of solvents being 8 g/m.sup.2. These solvents must be evaporated by application of process heat. In addition, they must be removed from the waste air for reasons of air pollution control. Regarding the high energy consumption, the problems of air pollution, and the resulting higher costs of investment and operation, this method is very disadvantageous.
As for the adherency properties which can be achieved the reactive adhesives correspond to the adhesive varnishes, approximately. At present, however, the universal application of such reactive adhesives is not yet possible as the methods are still in the phase of development and introduction. The reactive adhesives are applied without using solvents and less than 2 g/m.sup.2 is needed. Hereby the air pollution problems are solved and the energy consumption is largely reduced.
The treatment of foils surfaces with a corona discharge, i.e., a high frequency gas discharge under atmospheric pressure, is known from U.S. Pat. No. 3,823,061. After the treatment the surfaces are bonded together. The adhesive power of such a compound foil is, however, not completely satisfying and only a few sorts of foils can be used with this method.
The corona treatment of metallic foils such as aluminum foils is known from DAS No. 1,222,241; DAS No. 1,236,904; and DAS No. 1,241,682. The metallic surfaces treated in order to improve the adherency are subsequently either varnished, or laminated by means of adhesives, or extrusion-coated with synthetic materials such as polyethylene.
The corona treatment of non-conductive synthetic foils for the same purpose is also well known. A survey of the potential fields of application of the electric treatment of materials and surfaces is given in the article "Prospects for industrial applications of electrical discharge", Chem. Tech., April 1971, p. 232-237. This article gives, among others, a description of the above mentioned discharge treatment of plastic foils in order to improve the adherency while the foils are extrusion-coated with thin synthetic layers of polyethylene, e.g. This extrusion coating method with corona treatment already does not use any additional adhesives nor coupling agents. On the contrary, the molten synthetic layer acts as if it were an adhesive itself.
