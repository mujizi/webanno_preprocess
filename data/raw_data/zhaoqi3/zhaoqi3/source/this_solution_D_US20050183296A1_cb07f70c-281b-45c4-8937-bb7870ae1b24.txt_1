[0017] But in order to guarantee even better circulation of steam without obstructions between the vaporiser and the plate, another feature of the invention consists in the rear outlet of the vaporisation chamber being closed by a mesh that is immovable and has a passage that is suitably smaller than the sections of passage at the said front opening and of the said channels.
[0018] Since the outlet from the vaporisation chamber is at the rear and the steam must flow along the length of the vaporiser to reach its front opening, this reduces the risk of obstruction and allows for a homogeneous temperature over the whole of the vaporiser, and thus ensures that only steam leaves this chamber and not steam plus water.
[0019] Another object of the invention consists in the front opening of the vaporiser comprising a tube that is produced as a single unit in the vaporiser itself and that can be slotted into a corresponding orifice in the plate, which tube incorporates an external, immovable watertight gasket that acts between the said vaporiser and plate, and that is made of a material that is suitable for working under compression and at high temperatures. With this solution, only a single gasket is provided which does not function as a separator but rather as a compression piece. This provision accordingly utilizes a gasket made of a fluoro-elastomeric material which works better under compression than silicone and, in addition, is very tolerant of high temperatures. Furthermore, the coupling of the vaporiser to the plate is direct (does not require the use of any additional connection pieces, as does the brass cap) and resists better the stresses imposed by the ironing action and by temperature changes.
[0020] Another feature of the invention consists in that the thermostatic temperature-regulating means of the plate and vaporiser consist of primary and secondary thermal probes. It is anticipated that the thermal probes to be used are NTC (sensors also called NTC-Negative Temperature Coefficient thermistors) which are highly sensitive and have a rapid response time when compared with traditional thermostats that have been used until now. These properties of the thermal probes provide much greater precision and efficiency that will be reflected in the quality of the ironing when compared with other known domestic steam irons. In this connection, it should be said that resorting to inserting a third backup thermostat connected in series to the vaporiser is known, because, given the delay in response of the principal thermostat of the vaporiser, it becomes necessary to short-circuit this thermostat every time the micro-pump is activated, i.e. water gets in and the vaporiser's element operates immediately, otherwise not all the water is vaporised but, instead, a mixture of steam and water is obtained, whereas an NTC probe is advantageously used as a substitute for these two conventional thermostats (the normal and the subsidiary backup). On the other hand, the use of NTC probes makes the technology of the iron more electronic, and more coherent and compatible with the use of control chips containing computer programmes and display screens in which the relevant information is displayed regarding the condition of the iron and the ironing mode selected.
[0021] Another object of the present invention is that the said holes in the plate are fewer in number and are concentrated in the front section of the plate in the shape of an arrow head, and that they have the special feature that they open into certain grooves that extend to the rear section of the plate in the form of channelling grooves. With this solution, humidification of the garment is achieved by the front part of the plate, and drying is achieved as it passes down the rest of the plate so that ironing of superior quality is obtained.
