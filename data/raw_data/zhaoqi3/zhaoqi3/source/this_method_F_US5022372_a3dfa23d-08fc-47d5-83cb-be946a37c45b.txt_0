The fuel delivery rail assembly according to the invention is divided into two types, one of which is a shrinking type utilizing shrinking work and the other of which is an enlargement type utilizing enlargement work. FIGS. 1 to 4 illustrate the former type and FIGS. 5 to 7 illustrate the latter type.
Referring to FIGS. 1 to 4, there is shown a fuel delivery rail assembly 30 of the first type. Some portions are omitted for illustrative simplification. The front end 32 at the inlet side of the conduit 1, which has a square hollow section with a fuel passage 1A therein, is shrunk from its outside and its sectional form is transformed into a circular hollow section by pressing work. Within the front end 32, a fuel inlet pipe 2 is inserted and brazed thereto along the peripheral portion 33, whereby the fuel inlet pipe 2 is directly connected in alignment with the conduit 1. Shrinking work of the front end 32 of the conduit 1 is accomplished by various methods, such as pressing or swaging work. In a specific working step, a tailstock spindle is inserted into the front end 32.
In FIG. 4, there is shown an alternative embodiment for the case in which the outside diameter of the fuel inlet pipe is relatively small as compared with the inside diameter of the front end 32 of the conduit 1. In such a case, the distal end 35 of the fuel inlet pipe 2 may be enlarged in compliance with the shrunk diameter of the front end 32, and then the distal end 35 can be brazed to the front end 32 at the peripheral portion 33. With this method, there is an advantage that the invention can also be effected in a case where there is a considerable difference between the outside diameter of the fuel inlet pipe 2 and the outside dimension of the conduit 1.
Referring to FIGS. 5 to 7, there is shown a fuel delivery rail assembly 40 of the second type. Some portions are omitted for illustrative simplification. In FIG. 5, a front end 41 at the inlet side of the conduit 1, which has a rectangular hollow section with a fuel passage 1A therein, is enlarged from its inside and its sectional form is transformed into a circular hollow section by well known extending work. In preparing the conduit 1, a midpoint of the conduit 1 is clamped by a chuck and then a conical punch is inserted into the inside of the front end 41. Within the front end 41, a cylindrically machined surface 43 of the adaptor 42 is inserted and brazed together along the peripheral portion 45. During the brazing work, the alignment between the vertical plane of the flange surface 42A of the adaptor 42 and the axial directions of the sockets 4 can be carefully adjusted, so that a complete connection is established for eliminating fuel leakage after bolting up of the connection.
In FIG. 5, although the surface 43 is machined in stepped form so as to provide a stable fitting, this machining work can be reduced for economical purpose. Within the fuel inlet opening 47 disposed at the center of the adaptor 42, a fuel inlet pipe 18 mounted on the associated adaptor 17 is inserted and sealed therewith by an O-ring 20. As a modified construction, a single piece of the fuel inlet pipe 18 can be directly inserted into the fuel inlet opening 47 and brazed together.
