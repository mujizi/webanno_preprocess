Besides fins, the brake rotors of the present invention can have cored slots for better heat dissipation at the rotor surface or holes or depressions in the surface to help dissipate heat and to keep the surface clean and ungalled.
Brake rotors and clutches known in the prior art are generally comprised of a heavy material having a relatively high heat capacity and capable of having a hardened surface imposed thereon for use as the frictional engagement surface. In such cases, the mass of the rotor or clutch tends to act as a heat sink or, the heat generated at the frictional face and the conductivity of the thermal energy away from the frictional face is not critical.
Some lighter metals, such as aluminum, which would normally be attractive for use as rotors, have been considered unacceptable, due to inferior thermal strength, hardness or combination of both. Newer materials, such as composite materials containing nonmetallic particles in a metallic matrix, present a potential for new solutions to this problem.
The composites of the present invention are generally made by dispersing the particulate non-metallic material in the molten metal under agitation. Preferably, the useful material is a composite of non-metallic refractory ceramic particles in a metallic matrix, according to the procedure disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,467 to Skibo et al. My invention material, when cast from aluminum alloy A356 with 20% silicon carbide, has a measured density of 0.0996 pounds per cubic inch or 2.76 grams per cubic centimeter. This is comparable to a density of approximately 7.86 grams per cubic centimeter for cast iron.
An additional interesting property of such composite materials is the higher thermal conductivity. For example, the above material exhibits a thermal conductivity that is on the order of four times greater than thermal conductivity of cast iron. Generally, the thermal conductivity, that is the ability of the material to conduct heat away from the point of heat generation, is such that heat dissipation from the object is limited by the ability of the heat to be conducted through the material. For example, plain carbon steel has a thermal conductivity of 30 Btu/hr ft .degree. F.; stainless steel 304 has a thermal conductivity of 10 Btu/hr ft .degree. F.; ductile cast iron ASTM A339, A395 has a thermal conductivity of 10 Btu/hr ft .degree. F.; aluminum alloy 3003 ASTM B221 has a thermal conductivity of 90 Btu/hr ft .degree. F.; and aluminum alloy 2017 (annealed) ASTM B221 has a thermal conductivity of 95 Btu/hr ft .degree. F.
