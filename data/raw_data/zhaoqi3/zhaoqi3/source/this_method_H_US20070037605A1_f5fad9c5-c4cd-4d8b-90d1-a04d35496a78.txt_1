[0072] If a user deigned to set all movie theatres to a set ring-tone mode, a "pre-emptive" method might exist whereby the phone might query the user (preferably getting his attention via vibrate mode) regarding how the user might like the phone set up at a particular location. Therefore, if the user had his phone set to manner mode while at his church, but then attended a wedding at another church, the phone might recognize that the user was at a church and inquire as to whether the user wished manner mode to be invoked here as well. This pre-emptive method could be set the first time (or later) when the phone would ask, "Do you want to be asked to change your ring-tone settings at every theatre you enter?"
[0073] When the portable phone has been programmed to recognize that it has arrived at a location, or has otherwise detected conditions which would cause a change in the alert notification, the user may be notified and asked to confirm that the change should be made. The user may also program certain conditions to automatically change the mode without seeking confirmation.
[0074] Another method of setting ring-tone volume and mode would be to do so "globally". In this method, the user would ask the phone (which would work in conjunction with the server and other data sources) to deduce the social setting and ambient sound characteristics of whatever location the user found himself in. Thus, using a detailed database that could correlate GPS coordinates or other location data with building types, functions (subway stations), and settings (outdoors at the beach), the system could make certain deductions concerning how loud the ring might need to be to be heard and whether the ring might need to be attenuated for social purposes.
[0075] When the user was in a location where a ring-tone modification had been made, rules-based location sensing or GPS motion detection, or the accelerometer 124, may be able to discern when a user is starting to move about. At that point, the system might offer the opportunity to switch the volume or mode setting or might do so automatically. For instance, if the user started to move within a movie theatre, the system might deduce the movie was over and thus allow the phone to ring. This relaxation of ring volume control could begin after a set time period (for instance two minutes after movement began) or based on distance (once the user had moved 100 feet). Alternatively, perhaps when arriving at the theatre, the ring-tone modification would only kick in after the user was seated, either for a moment or a set number of minutes. In any of these cases, (arriving, leaving, or even going to the concession stand) the movement data could reasonably discern that a change had occurred in the socially-acceptably ringing volume allowed. Such distance and time settings could be set by each user and could vary for each location or class of locations.
[0076] In a further enhancement, the system might have stored in a database movie start and end times, church service schedules, and other data that might be used to automatically modulate the ring tone volume or mode.
