DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
The method of the present invention can best be described with reference to an actual example of a multilayer printed circuit including a thin film laminate. Consequently, the following description of a presently preferred embodiment of the method will refer to the multilayer, thin film laminate printed circuit board made by that method for use in connection with a blasting cap constructed in accordance with the present invention. It will be understood, however, by those skilled in the art who have the benefit of this disclosure that the method of the present invention is not restricted to a method of making only this particular circuit board and that any circuit board including a thin film laminate may conveniently be constructed by using this method. The following description is, therefore, merely an exemplary description of a method of making such a circuit board.
Referring first to FIG. 1, there is shown a circuit board 10 in the process of being made by the method of the present invention. At the particular stage in the method of the present invention shown in FIG. 1, the circuit board 10 has been completed and awaits the step of removing the temporary backing 12 therefrom as will be described below. At this stage, circuit board 10 is comprised of the temporary backing 12, which is adhered to a thin film laminate 14 such as the copper/Kapton .TM. laminate described above and sold under the brand name Microclad .TM. by a low melting point plastic adhesive 16. Also laminated to the thin film laminate 14 by a layer of thermally cured, high temperature adhesive 18 is an inner layer assembly 20. Construction of printed circuit board 10 is accomplished as follows.
The temporary backing 12, which can be, for instance, on the order of 0.020 inches thick, is cut to the desired size, as is the thin film laminate 14, and registration holes (not shown) are drilled in both the backing 12 and thin film laminate 14. Any of a number of resins may be used to advantage as the temporary backing. Particular success has been achieved using an FR4 resin system, but BT and FR5 resin systems may also be appropriate for use as temporary backing 12. A layer of low melting point plastic adhesive 16 is applied to one side of backing 12 and the thin film laminate 14 placed over the low melting point plastic 16 and pressed in, for instance, a vacuum hydraulic heat or hydraulic heat press to adhere the thin film laminate 14 to temporary backing 12 to form a thin film laminate/temporary backing assembly 22.
