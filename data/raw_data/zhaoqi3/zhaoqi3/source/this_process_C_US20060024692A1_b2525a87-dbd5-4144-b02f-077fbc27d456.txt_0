[0690] The results obtained above are summarized below for each of the genes of the present invention: [0691] NSC 807: KOC1; this gene encodes an hnRNA K-homology (KH) domain and an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain. The function of the KH domain to bind to the 5'UTR of the IGF-II (IGF2) leader 3' mRNA, may repress the translation of IGF-II during late development. The lower expression of this gene in normal tissues, high expression in NSCLCs, and reduced growth, proliferation and/or survival of the transfected cells by the suppression of this gene suggest usefulness of this gene as a novel diagnostic marker and target for new drugs and immunotherapy. [0692] NSC 810: TTK; this gene encodes an S TKc domain. The protein encoded by the gene phosphorylates proteins on serine, threonine and tyrosine, which phosphorylation probably is associated with cell proliferation. The lower expression of this gene in normal tissues, high expression in NSCLCs, and reduced growth, proliferation and/or survival of the transfected cells by the suppression of this gene suggest that this gene might be useful as a novel diagnostic marker and target for new drugs and immunotherapy. According to the present invention, the TTK protein expressed in stable transfectant promoted the growth of COS-7 cells in a dose dependent manner. This result suggested that over-expression of TTK exerts a transforming effect on mammalian cells. These data reveal that TTK might be a novel oncogene for NSCLC and suggest that a promising therapeutic strategy for treating lung cancers may be established by targeting TTK. [0693] NSC 811: SDC1; this gene encodes a putative band 4.1 homologues' binding motif (4.1 m) domain.

[0695] NSC 816: PIR51; the protein encoded by the gene is localized in the nucleus and no domain was found in the protein. The protein functions as a DNA- and RNA-binding protein; interacts with the RAD51 recombinase protein involved in DNA recombination and repair. The lower expression of this gene in normal tissues, high expression in NSCLCs, and reduced growth, proliferation and/or survival of the transfected cells by the suppression of this gene suggest that this gene might be useful as novel diagnostic marker and target for new drugs and immunotherapy.

These data reveal that URLC2 might be a novel oncogene for NSCLC and suggest that a promising therapeutic strategy for treating lung cancers can be established by focusing on the URLC2. [0698] NSC 849:GJB5; this gene encodes a gap junction protein, beta 5 (connexin 31.1). GJB5 is a member of the connexin family (beta-type (group i) subfamily). It is reported that one gap junction consists of a cluster of closely packed pairs of transmembrane channels, connexons, through which materials of low molecular weight diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell. A connexon is composed of a hexamer of connexins. The protein encoded by the gene was mainly detected in the cytoplasmic membrane by the immunocytochemical analysis.

This gene belongs to the tigger subfamily of the pogo superfamily of DNA-mediated transposons in humans. The proteins belonging to this subfamily are related to DNA transposons found in fungi and nematodes, and more distantly to the Tc1 and mariner transposases. The protein encoded by the gene is also very similar to the major mammalian centromere protein B. The exact function of this gene is unknown.

The protein encoded by the gene belongs to the kinesin-like protein family and interacts with guanosine triphosphate (gtp)-bound forms of rab6a and rab6b. The protein may act as a motor required for the retrograde rab6 regulated transport of golgi membranes and associated vesicles along microtubules. The protein has a microtubule plus end-directed motility, and is phosphorylated during the M-phase of the cell cycle. The lower expression of this gene in normal tissues, high expression in NSCLCs, and reduced growth, proliferation and/or survival of the transfected cells by the suppression of this gene suggest that this gene might be useful as a novel diagnostic marker and target for new drugs and immunotherapy.

This gene encodes a protein belonging to the superfamily of potassium channel proteins containing two pore-forming P domains. mRNA of this gene is mainly expressed in the cortical distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney. The protein encoded by the gene is highly sensitive to external pH and this, in combination with its expression pattern, suggests that it may play an important role in renal potassium transport.

The protein stimulates muscle contractions, specifically, that of the gastrointestinal tract and inhibit feeding. The lower expression of this gene in normal tissues, high expression in NSCLCs, and reduced growth, proliferation and/or survival of the transfected cells by the suppression of this gene suggest that this gene might be useful as a novel diagnostic marker and target for new drugs and immunotherapy. According to the present study, the NMU protein secreted into the culture medium by stable transfectant, or the active form of the NMU peptides added into the medium promoted the growth of COS-7 cells in a dose dependent manner. According to the immunohistochemical staining, the NMU protein was strongly stained in the cytoplasm of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma cells. These data revealed that NMU might be an important autocrine growth factor for NSCLC and suggested that a promising therapeutic and diagnostic strategy for treating lung cancers may be developed by focusing on the NMU ligand-receptor system. Furthermore, the suppression of NMU induced apoptosis in LC319 cells. Moreover, the suppression of NMU protein by anti-NMU antibody induced growth suppression compared with controls in LC319 cells.
