[0037] An inlet and/or an outlet and/or a pumping member of said pumping means, may be provided in the vicinity of said substantially plane side in order to provide a turbulence of flow and hereby improve the exchange of heat between said cooling liquid and substantially plane side, and the inlet of the pumping means may be provided within the first reservoir and the outlet may be provided within the second reservoir.
[0038] According to one aspect of the invention, a method is envisaged, said method of cooling a computer system comprising at least one unit such as a central processing unit (CPU) generating thermal energy and said method utilizing a cooling system for cooling the at least one processing unit and, said cooling system comprising a reservoir, at least one heat exchanging interface and a pumping means, said method of cooling comprising the steps of establishing, or defining, or selecting an operative status of the pumping means; controlling the operation of the motor of the pumping means in response to the following parameters; the necessary direction of movement for obtaining a pumping action of a pumping member of the pumping means, the possible direction of movement of a driving part of the motor of the pumping means; and in accordance with the operative status being established, defined or selected, controlling the operation of the computer system in order to achieve the necessary direction of movement of the driving part of the motor for establishing the necessary direction of movement for obtaining he pumping action of the pumping member.
[0039] There may be pumping means, where the pumping member is only operable in one direction but where the motor driving the pumping member is operable in two directions. The solution to this problem is to either choose a pumping member operable in both directions or to chose a motor being operable in only one direction. According to the invention, a solution is provided where a one-way directional pumping member may be operated any a two-way directional motor. Despite the contradictory nature of this solution, advantages may however be present.
[0040] As example, the method is being applied to a cooling system where the pumping member is a rotary impeller having a one-way direction for obtaining a pumping action, and where the motor of the pumping means is an electrical AC motor having a rotor constituting the driving part of the motor, and where said method comprises the step of establishing, or defining, or selecting a rotary position of the rotor of the electrical AC motor, and applying at least one half-wave of an AC power signal to the stator of the AC motor before applying a full-wave AC power signal.
[0041] As an alternative example, the method is being applied to a cooling system where the pumping member is a rotary impeller having a one-way direction for obtaining a pumping action, and where the motor of the pumping means is an electrical AC motor having a rotor constituting the driving part of the motor, and said method comprises the step of establishing, or defining, or selecting a rotary position of the rotor of the electrical AC motor, and applying at least one half-wave of an AC power signal to the stator of the AC motor after having applied the full-wave AC power signal.
