[0886] Example 14a, Step f: A solution of crude ((7R,8S)-8-Amino-1,4-dioxa--spiro[4.5]dec-7-yl)-methanol (0.086 mol) in 300 mL of CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 was treated with a 120 mL of saturated Na.sub.2CO.sub.3, and cooled in an ice bath. The mixture was stirred vigorously while benzyl chloroformate (17.3 mL, 0.108 mol) was added slowly. After the addition was complete the mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min. The organic layer was separated and washed with water, brine and concentrated to give 33 g of crude product. This was recrystallized from hexane to give pure Benzyl (1S,2R)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-(1,3-dioxolane)cyclohexylcarbamate.

[0888] Example 14a, Step 1: Benzyl (1S,2R)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-(1,3-dioxol-ane)cyclohexylcarbamate was dissolved in dry CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 prior to the addition of triethylamine (9.4 mL) This solution was cooled to 0.degree. C. and methanesulfonyl chloride (3.4 mL) was added. The resulting solution was stirred 2 h before saturated sodium bicarbonate was added. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer re-extracted with CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2. The combined organic layer was washed with brine and dried (Na.sub.2SO.sub.4). It was then filtered, concentrated and dried in vacuo to get (1R,2S)-2-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-5-(1,3-dioxolane)-cyclohexyl)m-ethyl methanesulfonate as a pale yellow oil. It was used without any further purification.
[0889] Example 14a, Step 2: To a solution of isopropanethiol (6.3 ml, 67.72 mMol) in anhydrous DMF at 0.degree. C. was added sodium hydride (2.7 g, 67.72 mMol) in small portions under a nitrogen flush. After the effervescence subsided, the cooling was removed and stirring continued at rt for 90 min after which ((1R,2S)-2-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-5-(1,3-dioxolane-)-cyclohexyl)methylmethane sulfonate(33.86 mMol) was dissolved in DMF (50 mL) and added slowly to the reaction. After 4 h, saturated NH.sub.4Cl was added to the reaction. Partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. Aqueous layer was re-extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layer was washed with brine and dried (MgSO.sub.4) After filteration and concentration, a flash column yielded benzyl (1S,2R)-2-(isopropylthiometh-yl)-4-(1,3-dioxolane)cyclohexyl carbamate as a pale oil (8.16 gm, 63% yield over two steps).
[0890] Example 14a, Step 3: A sample of benzyl (1S,2R)-2-(isopropylthiomet-hyl)-4-(1,3-dioxolane)cyclohexyl carbamate (8.15 g) was dissolved in acetonitrile (50 mL) prior to the addition of 1N HCl (50 mL). After 30 h the reaction was made basic by portionwise addition of saturated NaHCO.sub.3. It was then partitioned between EtOAc and water. The aqueous layer was re-extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layer was washed with brine and dried (MgSO.sub.4). Filtered, concentrated and dried in vacuo to result in benzyl (1S,2R)-2-(isopropylthiomethyl)-4-oxocyclohexyl-carbamate as a clear oil (6.57 g, quant. yield). MS found: (M+H).sup.+=336.1.
