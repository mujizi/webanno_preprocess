[0011] MWD/LWD instrument systems allow acquisition of near-"real-time" data on the conditions inside the wellbore. U.S. Pat. No. Re. 36,012, issued to Loomis et al. and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, describes a MWD/LWD apparatus using a pulsed neutron source.
[0012] In most cases, however, MWD or LWD tools are not in direct communication with surface-based recording and control instruments, or have a very slow communication up-link. Additionally, down-links are typically rare, and if used, are usually slow. Thus, the electrical power sources which create the acceleration voltage in the controllable neutron source are not under the direct control of the instrument operator. Such lack of direct control can cause safety concerns. As previously explained, pulsed neutron generators and x-ray generators require a separate electrical power source to provide acceleration potential. When pulsed neutron or x-ray generators are used in well logging applications, power for the neutron and/or x-ray generator generally comes from either stored energy devices or via transmission from the surface. Stored energy devices are typically batteries, but may include other devices such as fuel cells. Stored energy devices provide power continuously until they become depleted. In MWD applications, surface power is typically conveyed via drilling fluid ("mud") flow down the drill pipe to a turbine in the MWD tool. In wireline tools, the armored electrical cable is used to provide the power to the electronic source.
[0013] When using stored energy devices in a well logging tool, particularly in MWD applications where direct control by the instrument operator is not available, the instrument operator may not be able to determine whether the neutron or x-ray generator is activated or not. In wireline logging or surface-powered MWD systems (such as turbine powered systems), the instrument operator does not have this problem because the operator can stop the power source at the surface. Thus, in wireline or surface-powered MWD systems, the operator maintains direct control over the power source and, thus, maintains control over the production of radiation. With stored energy devices, however, the operator has no such direct control and, thus, the risk of unintentionally exposing personnel to radiation is significantly greater.
[0014] What is needed, therefore, are techniques for preventing a controllable radiation source in logging tools, which are not under direct control of the instrument operator, from generating radiation when the logging tools are not in the wellbore.
[0015] One aspect of the present invention is a method of operating a well logging tool having a controllable radiation source operatively coupled to a power source.
