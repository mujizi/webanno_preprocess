[0037] 3. Progress Indicator Displays
[0038] A rate of completion display, particularly a graphical rate indicator, can provide easily interpreted information which would allow a user to take action. For example, if a database can comfortably handle two automated processes comprising simultaneous queries from two threads but not three, then graphical rate of completion information in a progress indicator can a low the user to see the magnitude of the performance cost of the additional automated process. Also, the performance effect can also be shown for each thread (if each thread has an individual progress indicator).
[0039] Also, a numeric display, which may be highly unstable, can be more difficult to read than a graphical indicator. For example, in a constant period of time, if the completion rate of an automated process varies too much, a user may not be able to comfortably read and interpret the numbers. Some of this difficulty may be relieved by the developers at compile time by lowering the sampling rate for the rate measurement. But, if the progress bar is intended to display the progress of software or hardware whose speed could be upgraded significantly, the problem will eventually arise with upgrades to hardware and software. A graphical solution can avoid this problem.
[0040] Further enhancements afforded by embodiments of the present invention include providing graphical time-based information, including historical rate information, and a compact graphical display. A graphical time remaining display can assist the user in quickly determining the remaining time for a given automated process. In general, graphical indicators are viable alternatives to numeric or textual indicators. Historical information regarding rate of completion can also be useful, e.g. it may assist a user in determining which server to download a file from at different times in the day by comparing the rates for each server at previous times. Finally, depending on the implementation chosen for these features, GUI real estate can be conserved also. Whereas, conventional progress bars allow the user only to determine percent of completion graphically, embodiments of the present invention allow time-based information, such as rate of completion and/or time remaining, to be determined graphically. As detailed below, various types of graphical completion and time-based indicators can be employed in any combination.
[0041] FIG. 3A illustrates a varying height of a graphical completion indicator 300 showing historical rate information of the automated process. The graphical completion indicator 300 shows a completed portion of an automated process indicated by the horizontal length of the bar 302 between the start time 304A and current time 304B. As the automated process progresses, the length of the bar 302 varies to show the completed portion of the automated process. The bar 302 also includes a graphical time-based indicator comprising a graphical rate indicator. The height of the bar 302 indicates the rate of completion relative to a maximum rate. The varying height of the bar 302 may indicate the instantaneous rate at each point in time. Alternately, the varying height of the bar 302 may indicate a running average rate. The changes in rate are thus shown by different regions 306A-306D of the bar 302, e.g. a declining rate region 306A, a constant rate region 306B, an increasing rate region 306C and a steeply declining rate region 306D. In addition, the different regions 306A-306D may be shaded or colored differently to make their different meanings more apparent to a user.
