[0023] Likewise, the sand screen 42 shown in FIG. 6 may be used in a production well 10. The screen 42 allows fluid to be produced while preventing sand to enter the production conduit 16 and, at the same time, prevents fluid from exiting the production conduit 16.
[0024] FIG. 7 illustrates one use of the sand screen 42 of FIG. 6 having the check valves 22 therein in a production well 10, although many other uses in production wells are possible. In this aspect of the invention, a production conduit 16 extending into the well 10 has at least one substantially radial aperture 20 and may have many apertures 20. A valve 22, such as a check valve or other valve described herein, is mounted within in at least a portion of the apertures 20. The valve 22 allows flow therethrough from an exterior 26 to an interior 24 of the production conduit 16, but limits flow therethrough from the interior 24 to the exterior 26. Thus, fluid is allowed into the production conduit 16, but flow out of the production conduit 16 is restricted or prevented.
[0025] As one example of a use of this aspect of the present invention, some production wells, such as the one shown in the figure, have multiple zones 46, which may include multilateral wells. One problem sometimes associated with multizone wells is cross-flow. Cross-flow may occur when the pressure in one zone 46 is different than the pressure in another zone 46. In this case, fluid may flow from the higher-pressure zone 46 into the lower-pressure zone 46 rather than to the surface. The present invention may alleviate this problem by limiting the flow of fluid from the production conduit 16 to a target reservoir 46 with a valve 22 mounted within at least a portion of the apertures 20. Some apertures 20 may remain open depending upon the application (e.g., if some flow into the formation is permissible). Thus, a sand screen 42 as described above in connection with FIG. 6, is provided in each of the zones 46 in FIG. 7. The production zones 46 are separated fluidically by packers 18. The check valves 22 in the sand screens 42 prevent cross-flow between the formations. Note that the screens 42 may be replaced by a conduit 16 having the check valves 22 therein (e.g., as shown in FIG. 2) in those cases where the sand control provided by the screens 42 is not necessary or desired.
[0026] FIG. 8 illustrates another aspect of the current invention in which the conduit 16 having check valves 22 therein (which happen to be incorporated into sand screens 42 in FIG. 8) is combined with in-line flow control valves 47. The in-line flow control valves 47 may be used to regulate (e.g., choke) the flow to or from the various zones 46. See U.S. Patent Application Publication No. U.S. 2001/0045290 A1, published Nov. 28, 2001, for some examples of in-line valves 47.
[0027] Another problem often associated with injection applications involves channeling. Uncontrolled injectivity can create channeling, which prevents sweep uniformity and can lead to early water production in the production well 10. As illustrated in FIG. 9, the present invention provides for variation in the density and concentration of valves 22 according to the well 10. Using data relating to the well(s) or reservoir, spacing between conduit apertures 20 is set to provide a uniform sweep of injected fluid. By varying the spacing between apertures 20 (and associated valves 22) in the conduit 16, the sweep of injected fluid into the well 10 and target reservoir 46 is controlled to alleviate the risk of channeling. In FIG. 9, the conduit 16 has one section 48 with a relatively lower concentration of openings and associated valves 22 and another section 50 with a relatively higher concentration of openings and associated valves 22. The relative concentration may vary depending upon the particular requirements and characteristics of the well 10. The varying of the concentration of the valves 22 also has application in a production environment or system. For example, in production wells it is often desirable to vary the flow of fluid produced along the length of the well 10 to reduce coning. Horizontal wells tend to produce faster from the heel 52 of the well 10 relative to the toe 54 of the well 10. Accordingly, it may be desirable to have a lower concentration of valves 22 near the heel 52 of the well 10 (as illustrated in FIG. 9) to reduce the rate of production at the heel 52.
