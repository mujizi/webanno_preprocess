FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the construction of the control device 36 for controlling opening and closing of the low pressure control valve 24 shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 2, the condition of the rotational speed of the single shaft is selected to be equal to or greater than 60% of its rated speed of rotation. In order to ensure the amount of the steam produced by the low pressure generator 15 forming a part of the steam generator 13 (waste heat recovery boiler), the pressure condition of low pressure steam is established to prevent the low pressure control valve 24 from being opened in a state where the pressure of the low pressure steam is extremely low. This is because, if the low pressure control valve 24 is opened in a state where the pressure of the low pressure steam has not yet reached a sufficient level, the low pressure steam generator 15 is liable to be tripped. The opened and closed states of the high pressure control valve are detected for the purpose of ensuring supply of low pressure steam even in a state where no high pressure steam is produced. In general, a conventional arrangement is such that the low pressure stream control valve is opened ony under the condition that the high pressure control valve is open. However, the present invention is arranged in such a manner that the low pressure steam control valve is capable of being opened prior to the opening of the high pressure steam control valve f the conditions for the rotational speed of the single shaft and the pressure of low pressure steam are fulfilled. As a matter of course, if the period taken until the rotational speed reaches to a predetermined level and the period taken until the pressure of low pressure steam rises to a certain level can be anticipated prior to plant startup, the control device is capable of being arranged to cause opening of the low pressure control valve after a predetermined period of time has elapsed.
From the detailed description above, it will be appreciated that adaptation of the cooling method in accordance with the present invention enables the low pressure valve to be opened for the purpose of ensuring supply of cooling steam during the startup of the single-shaft combined plant. This provides the superior effect of preventing the steam turbine from being overheated due to a windage loss.
In addition, utilization of the cooling apparatus in accordance with the present invention enables easy performance of the aforesaid cooling method, thereby properly effecting the advantages of this method.
