[0053] FIG. 12a illustrates a preferred gray scale projector embodiment. The SLM is of the types that do not depend on polarization of illuminating light, such as DMD or TMA or the like. Again, the drawing assumes the SLM as transmissive type for convenience of explanation. The polarization beamsplitter 1220, TIR prism 223 and two reflectors 224 and 225 separate the illumination beam into two paths. The display panel 130 is therefore defined with two sub-panels, each illuminated with light of a different polarization (P or S). After the projection lens, a similar optical setup merges the two sub-panels on a projection screen at a distance. A second aperture plate 911 is inserted into one of the two paths to create scaled illumination on the two sub-panels. For example, if on each sub-panel one pixel contains four sub-pixels of equal size, then the gray level of one pixel is 5 (0-4). If the illumination intensity over the two sub-panels are scaled as 1:5, then the combined gray level is 25 (5.times.5).
[0054] FIG. 12b illustrates still another preferred embodiment of gray scale projector. The display panel is the type based on polarization, such as a FLC SLM. The setup is basically similar to that of FIG. 12a, except for a few additional components. Polarization difference is used for separation of illumination paths and for merging of the two sub-panels. However, because the display image is also based on difference of polarization, some special treatments with use of additional components are needed. First, the images on the two sub-panels are defined to always have different polarization states. That is, when sub-panel 130A displays images of P state and background of S state, then sub-panel 130B displays images of S state and background of P state. In this way, the images from the two sub-panels can be separated by the polarizing beamsplitter 1221 into two paths and then merged together at a distance 180. A 1/2-wave plate 1265 is therefore needed to turn the polarization axis of one of the two images 90 degree, so that both images are projected with the same polarization state. A screen aperture 1212 is also needed to block unwanted half images from reaching the screen. Again, the polarization rotator 1270 and is used for projecting inverted image frames.
[0055] The method of combining and merging images from a display panel of color triad type structure described above applies not only to color triads or sub-panels structure created by Pattern Projection techniques, but also to any display panel with built-in color triads or build-in separate and isolated sub-panels. When sub-panels are defined as separate and isolated regions on an SLM, one can even illuminate all sub-panels with a white light and then use dichroic color mirrors to filter out desired color from each sub-panels and then merge them into one image. The disadvantage of this method is that it throws away 2/3 light. Similarly, in a gray scale projector such as the one depicted in FIG. 12a, the SLM can also be illuminated with non-polarized light. The merging optics after the projection lens 160 can still filter out the desired sub-panel images and merge them into one image, with 1/2 light being thrown away.
[0056] In addition to using arrays of micro-lens, there are many other ways of creating a pattern of light spots or stripes. Depending on how the light is manipulated, there can be three broad categories of ways:
[0057] (1) Using an array of light re-directing elements: A light re-directing element changes the direction of light to form the desired light pattern. One example is spherical micro-lens, which can be used to create arrays of circular spots, as already described in FIG. 1a Another example is micro-cylindrical lens, as illustrated in FIG. 13a, which can generate arrays of stripes, as illustrated in FIG. 3d. Stacking two arrays of micro- cylindrical lens in orthogonal directions, as illustrated in FIG. 13b, can generate square light spots as the ones depicted in FIG. 6 b & c. Another example is an optical fiber bundle, wherein each optical fiber can represent a light spot when the opposite end is illuminated, as illustrated in FIG. 13c. An array of concave reflective surface can also create an array of light spots or stripes, as illustrated in FIG. 13d.
