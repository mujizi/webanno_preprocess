[0004] However, it is increasingly a requirement from car manufacturers that there should be no substantial movement of the steering column assembly when forces of up to 6000N are applied. The objective is to prevent unwanted movements of the steering wheel in a crash so that the deployment of the air bag is ideally controlled.
[0005] For this, friction alone is often insufficient, as massive clamp forces would be needed to achieve this. Some method of Positive Locking is needed. Typically this involves the use of inter-engaging teeth.
[0006] There is a well known problem with the type of "Positive-Locking" column which uses rows of inter-engaging teeth whereby, prior to operation of the locking lever by the driver, the selected steering wheel position has resulted in exact alignment of the tips of one row of teeth with those of the set of teeth with which they are supposed to engage. Inter-engaging of the teeth during the clamping operation is thereby blocked and, if excessive force is applied by the driver to the clamp lever to force it to complete its travel, permanent damage can occur to the tips of the teeth. At the very least, such a Tooth-on-Tooth occurrence will require the driver to consciously re-release the lever, find a slightly different wheel position and then re-engage the lever. Unless special means are provided to overcome this problem, then it is likely to occur during 10% to 20% of all adjustment operations. This is undesirable.
[0007] It is a feature of the present invention is to provide a steering column assembly including a clamp mechanism that at least partially ameliorates this tooth-on-tooth problem.
[0008] Accordingly, the invention provides an adjustable steering column assembly which includes a first portion, a second portion and a clamp mechanism that comprises a fixed rack secured to the first portion and a moving rack secured to the second portion, the first and second portions being releasably engaged by the clamp mechanism to selectively permit an amount of relative movement between the first and second portions that is required during reach and/or rake adjustment of the steering column assembly, in which:
