The invention is further related to a network for distributive transmission of distribution signals of a kind as known from Yamashita and Tsuchiya, in which network the coupling arrangement according to the invention is applied in at least one of the network nodes. In a preferred embodiment of the network, each network node is provided with the coupling arrangement according to the invention. Thereby the network is self-healing for at least each network node which is provided with the coupling arrangement according to the invention, without the network possessing the above-mentioned disadvantages.
The invention is further applicable in a distributive network in which the technique of dual homing is applied, that is to say, that each network node is accessible for the distribution signals, which are distributed by two separate, preferably geographically dispersed, central nodes. In such dual homing network at least one, but preferably all of the network nodes are provided with the coupling arrangement of the invention. Application of dual homing takes place to cope with failure of a central node.
In T. H. Wu, "Fiber Network Service Survivability", Artech House, Boston, 1992 (referred to hereinafter as "Wu") and in particular in Section 4.7 there of, "Broadband broadcast SONET SHR architecture", pp. 195-201, a so-called self-healing ring is described which is utilisable as a distributive optical network. From a central or main node, signals are transmitted in one direction over a transport ring, a so-called add/drop multiplexer (ADM) being used in each node of the ring in a position designated as "drop-and-continue". In this position of the ADM the signals which are selected (or are to be selected) by the node concerned are taken from the transport ring, and at the same time all signals are conducted further over the transport ring. In the event of a cable rupture between two successive nodes, the connection with the transport ring in the onward going direction is interrupted in each of those two nodes and is interconnected with a protective ring in the opposite direction. Thereby the signals which are received via the transport ring are further conducted in the opposite direction via the protective ring. In this solution, however, the network applied--the transport ring and the protection ring are formed by separate optical fibre connections--and the nodes included in it are more extensive and complex than is necessary for the actual functionality of the signal distribution.
The above mentioned publication by Yamashita and Tsuchiya and the above mentioned publication by Wu are deemed to be incorporated by reference in the present application.
The invention will be further explained by means of a description of an exemplary embodiment, reference being made to a diagram which comprises the following figures:
