The corner post 10a is then brought into position and pushed together with the downwardly projecting element 114 and the joined mitered ends 22a of the channels 22. Simultaneously the ends of the bottom channel elements 60 will be forced over the adapters 96 projecting from the post 10a in the manner shown in FIG. 8a. As the upper end of the post 10a is pushed over the protruding side edges of the vertical wall 130 and the extensions 134 of the arcuate walls 132 of the element 114, it will be found that such edges will either dig slightly into the insides of the post walls or will become wedged in against one of the angular ridges 91a in the manner illustrated in FIG. 12. Between such a forced fit and the catch locking of the bottom rail channel members 60 on the adapters 96, it will be found that when the post is secured in the decking 12, the rail assemblies which have been mounted on the post 10a cannot be removed from the post without such an amount of force as will demolish at least a portion of the railing assembly.
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR ASSEMBLING RAIL SYSTEMS
It is also a feature of the present invention to provide means and apparatus for assembling on a production basis a railing system of the type illustrated in the drawings and hereinabove described. One method and apparatus for accomplishing such assembly is illustrated in FIGS. 13 through 16 of the drawings. According to this method and apparatus, a special assembly table or deck 140 is provided with a centrally raised section 142 upon which the pickets 20 are first laid out side by side preparatory to assembly with the top and bottom railing systems 14, 18 and the posts 10. Desirably, this raised section 142 of the table 140 would be provided with marking lines to enable a workman properly to lay out the pickets 20 for the assembly operations. The table or deck 140 should also have lower level sections 144, 146 on each side of the central section 142.
The lower level section 144, on which the channel element 22 will be laid on its side as shown in FIGS. 14 and 16, should be at such a level as to properly align the opening, defined by the edges 24a of the folded-over portions 24 of the sidewalls 26 of the channel member 22, with the bottom cover locking plate 40 after it has been mounted on the ends of the pickets 20 in the manner shown in FIG. 14. The lower level 146 on the opposite side of the raised table portion 142 desirably should be such as to enable each bottom rail channel element 60, when laid on one of its sides 64, to be properly aligned with each of the lower ends 83a, of the pickets 20 for insertion of such ends 83a into the element 60 in the manner hereinabove described and particularly illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 14 of the drawings.
In effecting the assembly of both the individual components of each railing section 11 as well as of several sections 11 with mounting posts 10 interposed between each adjoining pair of railing sections 11, the ends of the pickets 20 may be inserted into the orifices in the bottom locking cover plate 40 and in the bottom rail channel member 60 to where each end abuts the ramp 56, in the case of the orifice 58 in the bottom locking cover plate 40, or the projections 66, in the case of the bottom rail channel member 60. The bottom locking cover plates 40 and bottom rail channel members 60 are laid out on the table 140 in abutment with and separated by the mounting posts 10 which are to be included with a complete railing section of a predetermined length such as, for example, 20 feet. Each post 10 should have inserted in its upper end 90d its U-shaped capping member 100 and the wedge 108 driven down inside between the sidewalls 102 of the member 100 so that upper extremities 109 of the walls 102 are ready to be forced between the opposing edges 24a of the bent over portions 24 of the sidewalls 26 of the element 22. The bottom edges 64a of the sidewalls 64 of the bottom channel elements 60 are placed in abutment with a vertical wall 148. The posts 10, however, are not supported at their lowermost flared ends 90b but, simply, extend into culverts or channels 150 and are spaced from the heads of pistons or other pusher elements 152, the function of which will later be described.
