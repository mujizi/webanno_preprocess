In another known method, that is hemofiltration, blood is conducted in an extracorporeal circuit through a hemofilter by which an ultrafiltrate is withdrawn containing the uremic toxins. At the same time, in a first nutrient an equal quantity of a uremic-toxin-free substitution solution is again added in proportion to the blood. In the exchange element used in this method, which may be a dialyzer or a hemofilter, an exchange thus takes place of fluid components to another fluid or a fluid flows along another fluid, for example blood plasma along dialysis solution. Since these fluids or solutions have different temperatures a temperature or heat exchange also takes place.
In DE-OS 3,313,421 such hemodialysis and hemofiltration apparatuses are described. In these known apparatuses the dialysis solution source or substituate source is heated to a predetermined temperature with a temperature regulating unit, the temperature of the source being passed from a temperature detector to a control unit which controls the heating means in accordance with said measured temperature value and a predetermined temperature value. The predetermined temperature value is entered by the attending physician prior to the dialysis session and thereafter kept constant during the entire treatment.
In an article by Q. Maggiore et al. in Proc. EDTA (1981) Vol. 18, p. 597-602, it is shown that the frequently observed and to this date generally accepted better blood pressure stability in the method of insulated ultrafiltration is due to the fact that in this method thermal energy is withdrawn from the blood of the patient. In particular, it has been found that during conventional hemodialysis as well a better blood pressure stability is achieved if the temperature of the dialysis solution is lowered from the usual value of 37.degree. C. to 34.degree. C. It was however also observed that many patients found this temperature drop unpleasant.
By this step the blood temperature in the arterial tubing system was kept substantially constant. The measuring means used were thermistors inserted directly into the tubing system. Consequently, the entire system had to be subsequently sterilized.
In a later article by Q. Maggiore et al. in Trans Am Soc Artif Intern Organs (1982), Vol. 28, p. 523-527, it is shown that in hemofiltration as well the thermal energy balance influences the circulation stability. Measurements were made from which it is apparent that in conventional hemodialysis energy is supplied to the extracorporeal circuit. This is considered to be a cause for the rise of the body temperature which has a disadvantageous effect on the condition of the patient. As measuring means in the extracorporeal circuit special plastic disposable articles were used which permitted introduction of a thermometer without direct blood contact. A constant measurement deviation of 1.degree. C. occurs.
