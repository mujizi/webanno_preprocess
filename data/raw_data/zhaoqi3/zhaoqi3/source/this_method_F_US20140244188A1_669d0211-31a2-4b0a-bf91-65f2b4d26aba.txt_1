[0097] In addition, to ensure the stability of forecasting, a method for multi-model combination forecasting can be adopted, wherein a mean or weighted mean is calculated in view of forecast results of various statistical models. Since the statistical method is based on historical data, a good result will be produced for forecasting of recent moments (e.g., 0-3 hours); however, a forecast result for a long time (e.g., 24-48 hours) has large calculation error due to non-linear characteristics of atmospheric motion.
[0098] Alternatively, a hybrid method can be adopted, i.e., the physical method and the statistical method are combined and given different weights in different forecast periods.
[0099] Referring to FIG. 7, due to special characteristics of a wind farm 710 itself, special requirements are imposed on wind information at each wind turbine 720 in the wind farm. As spacing between wind turbines is usually less than 500 m, high-precision forecast values should be provided. In addition, the deployment of wind turbines depends on terrain factors and in some areas can be distributed in a panhandle area, and accordingly, a model grid resolution higher than 1 km at least is required. However, if the entire wind farm is covered with a grid having a resolution of 1 km.times.1 km or higher, the computational amount is amazingly huge. Based on special characteristics of the distribution of wind turbines, the present invention proposes a terrain-following nested grid technique, which provides a higher grid resolution in areas where wind turbines are concentrated and provides a lower grid resolution where wind turbines are sparsely distributed. This method can reduce the computational amount and ensure that a enough precise forecast result can be obtained at each wind turbine.
[0100] FIG. 7 schematically illustrates a schematic view 700 of generating a forecast value of wind information at hub-height of a specific wind turbine according to one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 7 includes a high-precision grid 740 with at leas tone wind farm 710, at least one wind tower 730 and at least one wind turbine 720. Suppose the resolution of a dashed grid in FIG. 7 is 4 km.times.4 km, and the resolution does not satisfy the precision of wind information forecast. Therefore, by reading location information of wind turbines in the wind farm, the grid is refined to 4.times.4 grids (1 km.times.1 km for each) with a higher resolution in areas where wind turbines are concentrated, so as to generate higher-precision forecast values of wind information. With this method, on the one hand the precision of wind information forecast values at a specific wind turbine can be improved, and on the other hand, the computational amount of wind information at hundreds of or even more wind turbines in the entire wind farm can be controlled.
[0101] FIG. 8 schematically illustrates a block diagram 800 of an apparatus for forecasting output power of a wind turbine in a wind farm according to one embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, FIG. 8 illustrates an apparatus for forecasting output power of a wind turbine in a wind farm, comprising: a generating module 810 configured to generate a corrected data set based on environmental data collected from at least one sensor in the wind farm; a correcting module 820 configured to correct a weather forecasting model by using the corrected data set; an obtaining module 830 configured to obtain a forecast value of wind information at the wind turbine based on the corrected weather forecasting model; and a forecasting module 840 configured to forecast the output power of the wind turbine based on the forecast value and a power forecasting model.
