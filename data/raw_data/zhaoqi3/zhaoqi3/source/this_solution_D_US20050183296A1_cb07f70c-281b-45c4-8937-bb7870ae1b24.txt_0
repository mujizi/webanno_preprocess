[0015] Another object of the present subsidiary patent refers to the distinctive internal structure of the vaporisation chamber.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES
[0016] In view of the prior art, a prime object of the present invention consists in that the vaporisation chamber has a rear outlet that communicates with the front opening of the vaporiser by way of a pair of deep channels that are integrated into the vaporiser and that extend co-laterally to the vaporisation chamber itself. This solution assumes a considerable increase in size of the section of the passage for circulation of steam, due both to the greater depth of the channels as well as to the provision of two channels instead of one. At the same time, the possession of two channels provides an alternative that ensures circulation of steam towards the plate in the possible event that one of the channels becomes obstructed or considerably constricted.
[0017] But in order to guarantee even better circulation of steam without obstructions between the vaporiser and the plate, another feature of the invention consists in the rear outlet of the vaporisation chamber being closed by a mesh that is immovable and has a passage that is suitably smaller than the sections of passage at the said front opening and of the said channels.
[0018] Since the outlet from the vaporisation chamber is at the rear and the steam must flow along the length of the vaporiser to reach its front opening, this reduces the risk of obstruction and allows for a homogeneous temperature over the whole of the vaporiser, and thus ensures that only steam leaves this chamber and not steam plus water.
