In drawings which illustrate embodiments of the invention, FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of the proposed two-stage high recovery membrane process for the economical purification of large flowrates of water containing low to moderate TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) with moderate to high hardness. In essence, FIG. 1 shows a prefiltration step 2 intended to remove suspended matter by suitable means such as coagulation, flocculation, clarification, multi-media filtration, ultrafiltration or microfiltration. Prefiltration is followed by the first reverse osmosis or nanofiltration stage (RO-1 or NF-1, respectively), 7, where the bulk of the water is purified via stream 14. The concentrate from RO-1, 8, is treated further in the second RO or NF stage, 11 (i.e. RO-2 or NF-2) where the remaining water is purified via stream 15, combining with stream 14 to provide the ultimate purified water, stream 16 and providing only a small aqueous reject stream 13. In order to prevent scale formation in first and second membrane stages, an ion exchange "softening resin" 17 is used to treat the RO-2 or NF-2 concentrate stream 12, providing a "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate stream 18 which is split into two streams 9 and 10 which are recycled and blended with hardness-containing "feed streams" to first stage (i.e. stream 3) and to second stage (i.e. stream 8), respectively.
FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of an enhanced recovery 2-stage single pass membrane process for the economical purification of large volumes of water containing low to moderate TDS and moderate to high hardness where a relatively high water purity is required with a minimum discharge of rejects. In essence, this process is similar to the process depicted in FIG. 1 except for partial recycling of the purified second stage membrane permeate back to the influent side of the first stage membrane via stream 25, thus enabling further purification using the 2-stage single pass membrane system and reducing costs.
FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of yet another enhanced recovery 2-stage double pass membrane process for the economical purification of moderate to large volumes of water containing low to moderately low TDS and moderate to high hardness where very high treated water purity is required (i.e. water electrical receptivity >2 meager Ohms) with a minimum discharge of rejects. In essence, this process is similar to the process depicted in FIG. 2 except for the addition of a second pass membrane system 27 to treat the permeate from the two-stage membrane system. The low-TDS and very low hardness 2nd pass membrane concentrate stream 28 back to the influent side of the first membrane stage, thus providing only a very small overall process reject stream 13 and a very high purity product stream 29 which can be used in the pharmaceutical industry.
FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of yet another enhanced recovery 2-stage double pass membrane process for the economical purification of moderate to large volumes of water containing low to moderate TDS and moderate to high hardness where an extremely high water purity is required (i.e. water electrical resistivity >18 mega ohms) with a minimum discharge of rejects. In essence, this process is similar to the process depicted in FIG. 3 except for the addition of a "mixed bed" ion exchange polishing resin 30 which will remove trace ions from the purified membrane permeate 29, thus providing an extremely high purity water which can be used in the electronics' industry while producing only a very small reject stream 13.
FIG. 5 is a schematic representation of yet another enhanced recovery 2-stage membrane process for the economical purification of moderate to large volumes of water where sparingly soluble compounds are removed from the second membrane stage concentrate 12 by means of chemical precipitation step 19 followed by gravity settling or clarification step 21 with or without the addition of chemical coagulants and/or flocculants. After separation of bulk suspended solids, fine solids in the water are separated by a polishing filter such as a multi-media filter, microfilter or ultrafilter 23, followed by recycling and splitting of the "softened" and "suspended solids' free" second stage membrane concentrate stream 18 between the first and second membrane purification stages, as described in FIG. 1.
