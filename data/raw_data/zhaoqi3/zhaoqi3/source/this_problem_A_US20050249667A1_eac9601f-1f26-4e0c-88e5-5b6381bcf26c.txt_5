[0556] By way of yet further illustration, and referring to U.S. Pat. No. 4,916,193 (the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification), the polymeric material may be a copolymer containing carbonate repeat units and ester repeat units (see, e.g., claim 1 of the patent). As disclosed in column 2 of the patent, it may also be "collagen," "homopolymers and copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid," "alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids in conjunction with Krebs cycle dicarboxylic acids and aliphatic diols," "polycarbonate-containing polymers," and "high molecular weight fiber-forming crystalline copolymers of lactide and glycolide." Thus, it is disclosed in such column 2 that: "Various polymers have been proposed for use in the fabrication of bioresorbable medical devices. Examples of absorbable materials used in nerve repair include collagen as disclosed by D. G. Kline and G. J. Hayes, "The Use of a Resorbable Wrapper for Peripheral Nerve Repair, Experimental Studies in Chimpanzees", J. Neurosurgery 21, 737 (1964). Artandi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,272,204 (1966) reports the use of collagen protheses that are reinforced with nonabsorbable fabrics. These articles are intended to be placed permanently in a human body. However, one of the disadvantages inherent with collagenous materials, whether utilized alone or in conjunction with biodurable materials, is their potential antigenicity. Other biodegradable polymers of particular interest for medical implantation purposes are homopolymers and copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid. A nerve cuff in the form of a smooth, rigid tube has been fabricated from a copolymer of lactic and glycolic acids [The Hand; 10 (3) 259 (1978)]. European patent application No. 118-458-A discloses biodegradable materials used in organ protheses or artificial skin based on poly-L-lactic acid and/or poly-DL-lactic acid and polyester or polyether urethanes. U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,353 discloses bioresorbable polyester polymers, and composites containing these polymers, that are also made up of alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids, in conjunction with Krebs cycle dicarboxylic acids and aliphatic diols. These polyesters are useful in fabricating nerve guidance channels as well as other surgical articles such as sutures and ligatures. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,243,775 and 4,429,080 disclose the use of polycarbonate-containing polymers in certain medical applications, especially sutures, ligatures and haemostatic devices. However, this disclosure is clearly limited only to "AB" and "ABA" type block copolymers where only the "B" block contains poly(trimethylene carbonate) or a random copolymer of glycolide with trimethylene carbonate and the "A" block is necessarily limited to glycolide. In the copolymers of this patent, the dominant portion of the polymer is the glycolide component. U.S. Pat. No. 4,157,437 discloses high molecular weight, fiber-forming crystalline copolymers of lactide and glycolide which are disclosed as useful in the preparation of absorbable surgical sutures. The copolymers of this patent contain from about 50 to 75 wt. % of recurring units derived from glycolide."
[0557] By way of further illustration, and referring to U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,907 (the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification), the polymeric material may be the poly-phosphoester-urethane) described and claimed in claim 1 of such patent. Furthermore, the polymeric material may be one or more of the biodegradable polymers discussed in columns 1 and 2 of such patent. As is disclosed in such columns 1 and 2: "Polymers have been used as carriers of therapeutic agents to effect a localized and sustained release (Controlled Drug Delivery, Vol. I and II, Bruck, S. D., (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1983; Leong, et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Review, 1:199, 1987). These anti-mitotic compound delivery systems simulate infusion and offer the potential of enhanced therapeutic efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity." The polymeric material may be such a poly-phosphoester-urethan- e.
[0558] U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,907 also discloses "For a non-biodegradable matrix, the steps leading to release of the anti-mitotic compound are water diffusion into the matrix, dissolution of the therapeutic agent, and out-diffusion of the anti-mitotic compound through the channels of the matrix. As a consequence, the mean residence time of the anti-mitotic compound existing in the soluble state is longer for a non-biodegradable matrix than for a biodegradable matrix where a long passage through the channels is no longer required. Since many pharmaceuticals have short half-lives it is likely that the anti-mitotic compound is decomposed or inactivated inside the non-biodegradable matrix before it can be released. This issue is particularly significant for many bio-macromolecules and smaller polypeptides, since these molecules are generally unstable in buffer and have low permeability through polymers in fact, in a non-biodegradable matrix, many bio-macromolecules will aggregate and precipitate, clogging the channels necessary for diffusion out of the carrier matrix. This problem is largely alleviated by using a biodegradable matrix which allows controlled release of the therapeutic agent. Biodegradable polymers differ from non-biodegradable polymers in that they are consumed or biodegraded during therapy. This usually involves breakdown of the polymer to its monomeric subunits, which should be biocompatible with the surrounding tissue. The life of a biodegradable polymer in vivo depends on its molecular weight and degree of cross-linking; the greater the molecular weight and degree of crosslinking, the longer the life. The most highly investigated biodegradable polymers are polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), copolymers of PLA and PGA, polyamides, and copolymers of polyamides and polyesters. PLA, sometimes referred to as polylactide, undergoes hydrolytic de-esterification to lactic acid, a normal product of muscle metabolism. PGA is chemically related to PLA and is commonly used for absorbable surgical sutures, as is the PLA/PGA copolymer. However, the use of PGA in controlled-release implants has been limited due to its low solubility in common solvents and subsequent difficulty in fabrication of devices." The polymeric material 14 may be a biodegradable polymeric material.
[0559] U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,907 also discloses "An advantage of a biodegradable material is the elimination of the need for surgical removal after it has fulfilled its mission. The appeal of such a material is more than simply for convenience. From a technical standpoint, a material which biodegrades gradually and is excreted over time can offer many unique advantages."
[0560] U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,907 also discloses "A biodegradable thereapeutic agent delivery system has several additional advantages: 1) the therapeutic agent release rate is amenable to control through variation of the matrix composition; 2) implantation can be done at sites difficult or impossible for retrieval; 3) delivery of unstable therapeutic agents is more practical. This last point is of particular importance in light of the advances in molecular biology and genetic engineering which have lead to the commercial availability of many potent bio-macromolecules. The short in vivo half-lives and low GI tract absorption of these polypeptides render them totally unsuitable for conventional oral or intravenous administration. Also, because these substances are often unstable in buffer, such polypeptides cannot be effectively delivered by pumping devices."
