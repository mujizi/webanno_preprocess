As a result, it was found out that most of the HA molecules remained undigested when treated with each of these proteases in the absence of urea. The HA molecules, which had been denatured with urea, employed as a substrate were not digested with V8 protease, thermolysin and pronase. When lysyl endopeptidase, chymotrypsin and subtilisin were used, the digestion proceeded excessively and the antigenicity for AI3C completely disappeared. When proteinase K was used, on the other hand, it was confirmed that the HA molecules were digested and polypeptide fragments having an avidity for AI3C were formed.
(3) Preparation of Stem Region Polypeptide
To the FHA molecules (250 .mu.g/1400 .mu.l) prepared in Example 9-(1) were successively added 100 .mu.l of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 500 .mu.l of 8 M urea and the resulting mixture was maintained at 42.degree. C. for 1 hour. To this solution was added 2000 .mu.l of an immobilized Proteinase K gel and maintained at 37.degree. C. for 7 hours under shaking. After centrifuging, the reaction mixture thus obtained was dialyzed against PBS for 12 hours and thus the stem region polypeptide was obtained.
(4) Properties of Stem Region Polypeptide
By using the stem region polypeptide of Example 9-(3) as a test sample, the antigenicity for AI3C was examined by the ELISA method. Namely, a diluted solution of the stem region polypeptide was added to a microtiter plate (Maxi Sorp; manufactured by Nunc) and immobilized at 37.degree. C. for 90 minutes. Then blocking was effected by using Block Ace (manufactured by Snow Brand Milk Products). Then these cells were continuously reacted with 2 antibodies [10 mg/ml AI3C solution diluted 200-fold, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G solution (manufactured by Cappel) diluted 500-fold] each for 90 minutes and the cells thus treated were washed with PBS. Finally, the peroxidase reaction was effected by using 0.03% H2O2 and 1 mg/ml of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in citric acid/phosphoric acid (pH 5.2). The amount of the antigen was calculated from the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 492 nm. As a standard, HA molecules described in Example 9-(1) were used. As the result of the ELISA method, it has been proved that this stem region polypeptide has an antigenicity comparable to that of HA molecules. The hemagglutination activity (HA value) of the stem region polypeptide was determined in the following manner. On a U-shaped 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon 3911: manufactured by Becton Dickinson Labware), the sample solution was diluted with PBS in two steps. Then the same amount of a 0.5% avian erythrocyte suspension was added thereto and the mixture was stirred well. After reacting at room temperature for 1 hour, agglutination of the erythrocytes was observed. The highest dilution ratio showing agglutination was taken as the HA value.
