[0093] During use of one aspect of the invention, cells were introduced through a branching inlet port of a microfluidic device to individual chambers comprising trapping arrays (FIG. 4). Single cells were isolated in regular high density arrays composed of two channel height levels. A larger 40 .mu.m channel height serves as the main fluid conduits for cell solutions, while the 2 .mu.m height regions was used to form elevated trapping regions (FIG. 5). Having a 2 .mu.m gap allowed a fraction of fluid streamlines carrying cells to enter a trap. Once a cell enters a trap and partially occluded the 2 .mu.m gap the fraction of fluid streamlines (and cells) entering the weir-trap trap region were reduced. This leads to a high quantity of single cell isolates (FIG. 5, FIG. 6a-e). In effect the probability of trapping was dependent on the number of cells previously trapped. This is shown statistically, by comparing a Poisson distribution to the experimentally measured distribution in FIG. 6e (N=199 trapping sites, 4 separate loadings). If trapping were independent of the previous trapping events the data should follow a Poisson distribution. Here single cells were shown in excess of the Poisson distribution while zero, three, and four trapped cells are depressed. If one tries to explain trapping to be purely dependent on geometrical fit then trapping of two cells is expected to be more common since the channel height is more than double the diameter of the typical mammalian cell (40 .mu.m compared to 15 .mu.m).
[0094] As discussed herein, various weir-trap sizes and geometries can be used. Maintaining the same weir-trap width and channel height, the depth of the weir-traps can be varied from 10 to 60 .mu.m. The depth of the trapping structures, signifying the "deepness" of the pocket, should not be confused with the channel depth which is referred to as "height". These various depths resulted in differences in the number of trapped cells (FIG. 6). For the 10 .mu.m deep weir-traps>50% of weir-traps contained single cells, with a decreasing fraction of single cell isolates as weir-trap depth increased. The distribution of number of cells trapped for the 10 .mu.m deep weir-traps is shown in FIG. 6e. The density of the array also effects trapping efficiency of single cells since, excess cells experience a higher shear force and are removed from less stable positions.
[0095] Devices were found to be quite effective and easy to use, with trapping able to be conducted in less than 30 seconds. Also, demonstrating the robustness of the method, the device has been successfully fabricated and operated. Differences in this method when comparing to other fluid mechanical methods of trapping include "self-sealing" of the trap as the resistance increases, geometrical tuning to enhance single cell isolates with a simple flow through procedure, and high density arrayability. To compare with flow cytometry (FC), although FC can interrogate hundreds of thousands of cells, and at several time points, analysis of the same cell over a long period of time is not possible, nor is positional dependent analysis of fluorescence within individual cells. Particularly difficult to probe with FC is fast time dependent changes upon addition of a compound to a cell. The device and techniques presented have the potential to bridge all of these gaps in FC, with moderate throughput.
[0096] Dynamic cellular analysis has been demonstrated by observing cell growth and division as well as enzyme content in arrays of individual cells. Cells can be maintained for long periods of time in culture with correct media, and especially useful is culture of suspension cells in a fixed location, that do not attach to surfaces and are difficult to observe using other methods.
[0097] Microfluidic chip fabrication. The molds for the trapping array culture device were fabricated using negative photoresists (SU-8 50 and SU-8 2002, Microchem Corporation, 3000 rpm spin speed, 40 .mu.m and 2 .mu.m thick) as in Di Carlo et al. Poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) was prepared according to the manufacturers instructions, degassed in a vacuum chamber for 1 hour and then poured on the mold and cured in a 70.degree. C. oven for 2 hours. The PDMS was cut from the mold with a surgical scalpel and then carefully peeled off the mold. The fluid inlet and outlet were punched by a flat-tip needle for tube connections. Both a glass slide and the PDMS structures were treated with oxygen plasma (0.5 torr, 40 W) for 20 seconds before bonding.
