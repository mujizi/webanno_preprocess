The further processing of the calcined spray dried powder takes place as in Example 2, except that the extruded hollowed strand has an inside diameter of 2 mm.
EXAMPLE 6
The coprecipitate for making the active catalyst phase is obtained by dissolving 808.0 g Fe(NO.sub.3).sub.3.9H.sub.2 O, 320.1 g Co(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O, 1744.8 g Ni(NO.sub.3).sub.2. 6H.sub.2 O and 0.1 g KNO.sub.3 in 3.1 liters of water; and, while stirring, at 90.degree. C., one first of all adds a solution of 34.9 g Sm.sub.2 O.sub.3 in 212 g of concentrated HNO.sub.3. To this solution, while stirring further, one adds 600.9 g of high dispersed silicic acid (Aerosil 200) and 1201.8 g of tempered montmorillonite (specific surfaces according to BET <1 m.sup.2 /g). In a separate vessel, at 60.degree. C., one prepares a solution of 2118.6 g (NH.sub.4).sub.6 Mo.sub.7 O.sub.24.6H.sub.2 O in 2.7 liters H.sub.2 O and to it, while stirring intensively, one adds 115.3 g of 85% H.sub.3 PO.sub.4. Thereafter, both solutions are combined while stirring intensively and one adds a solution of 485.1 g Bi(NO.sub.3).sub.3.5H.sub.2 O in 408 g 8.2% HNO.sub.3. The suspension thus obtained is dried in a spray drier at a drying air entry temperature of 550.degree. C. The ratio between drying air volume and spray suspension quantity is adjusted here so that one gets an exit temperature of 170.degree. C. and the suspension quantity is adjusted so that the spray dried powder will spend 6 seconds in the spray drier. The atomization intensity is selected so that one gets a spray dried powder with an average diameter of small dp=25 .mu.m. The spray dried powder is calcined in a rotary cylindrical kiln for a period of 30 minutes and at a maximum temperature, in the spray dried powder, of 420.degree. C.
The further processing of the calcined sprayed dried powder takes place as in Example 5.
