[0459] According to another set of embodiments, after repeated use, the dialyzer can lose its efficiency or even the ability to function at all as a result of compounds adhering to and building up on the membrane walls in the dialyzer. Any standard measure of dialyzer clearance determination may be used. However, one method of measuring how much build-up has accumulated in the dialyzer, i.e., how much the dialyzer's clearance has deteriorated, a gas is urged into the blood side of the dialyzer, while a liquid is held on the dialysate side of the dialyzer. By measuring the volume of gas in the dialyzer, the clearance of the dialyzer may be calculated based on the volume of gas measured in the dialyzer.
[0460] Alternatively, in other embodiments, because of the pneumatic aspects of the present system, clearance may be determined as follows. By applying a pressure differential along the dialyzer and measuring the flow rate of the dialyzer, the clearance of the dialyzer may then be correlated/determined or calculated, based on the pressure differential and the flow rate. For example, based on a known set of correlations or pre-programmed standards including a correlation table or mathematical relationship. For example, although a look-up table may be used, or a determined mathematical relationship may also be used.
[0461] The dialyzer's clearance can also be measured using a conductivity probe in the blood tube plug-back recirculation path. After treatment the patient connects the blood tubes back into the disinfection ports. The fluid in the blood tubes and dialyzer may be recirculated through these disinfection port connections, and the conductivity of this solution may be measured as it passes through the conductivity measurement cell in this recirculation path.
[0462] To measure the dialyzer clearance, pure water may be circulated through the dialysate path and the conductivity of the fluid flowing through the blood recirculation path is continuously monitored. The pure water takes ions from the solution in the blood flow circuit recirculation path at a rate which is proportional to the clearance of the dialyzer. The clearance of the dialyzer may be determined by measuring the rate at which the conductivity of the solution in the blood flow circuit recirculation path changes.
[0463] The dialyzer's clearance can be measured by circulating pure water on one side and dialysate on the other, and measuring the amount of fluid passing through the dialyzer using conductivity.
