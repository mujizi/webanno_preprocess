[0003] Fuel systems on board vehicles of various types generally comprise a tank for storing fuel, and this tank generally comprises at least one internal accessory. One particular case of such accessories is that of noise reduction baffles, the purpose of which is to absorb the noise ("slosh" noise) associated with the waves which may be generated inside the tank when the vehicle accelerates rapidly, brakes, turns, etc. Such baffles are also known as "anti-slosh baffles" in the automotive field.
[0004] In some countries, environmental legislations have forced the use of OBD systems (i.e., On Board Diagnosis systems) to test the leak tightness of the fuel systems of the vehicles. Often, these tests imply putting the tank for some time under negative pressure. Hence, especially in the case of plastic tanks, these have to be designed to withstand these negative pressures.
[0005] The process described in Application US 2006/0207991 makes it possible to solve this problem by providing interference sections projecting inward in the fuel tank from an upper surface and a lower surface of the fuel tank, respectively, and being disposed so as to be substantially opposed with a specified interval between them. In a specific embodiment, these sections are molded in the shape of baffles which also act as slosh noise suppressing baffles. However, such a solution offers several drawbacks: [0006] the volume occupied by said baffles is rather important and reduces the inner volume available for the fuel [0007] it increases the overall weight of the tank, each baffle being kind of double walled [0008] it does not offer many possibilities in terms of shape and material since these baffles are molded from the tank wall.
[0009] The present invention aims at solving these problems by providing a process which allows to provide a fuel tank both with a noise reduction baffle and with a vacuum (negative pressure) resistance device and this in an easy and flexible way, without limiting the internal volume of the tank or increasing its weight.
[0010] For this purpose, the present invention relates to a plastic fuel tank comprising a noise reduction baffle and interference sections for suppressing tank deformation in the case of application of negative pressure to said tank, the interference sections projecting inward in the tank from an upper surface and a lower surface thereof respectively, and being disposed so as to be substantially opposed with a specified interval between them, one of these sections being part of a fixation device which secures the baffle to the tank wall.
