Synthesis of Functionalized Copolymer (10) of Butyl Rubber with 7 Mol % Isoprene Units
a) Synthesis of epoxidized butyl rubber (8)
[0089] Unpurified butyl rubber containing 7 mol % isoprene (0.2 g, 0.25 mmol of isoprene units) was dissolved in dry toluene (10 mL). m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (0.21 g, 1.25 mmol) was dissolved in 13 mL dry toluene, and then this solution was added to the rubber solution. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After evaporation of the solvent in vacuo, the product was precipitated in acetone/toluene (2:1) 3 times. The resulting epoxidized rubber 8 was dried under vacuum (Yield=92%). .sup.1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl.sub.3): .delta. 2.77 ppm (t, 1H, J=5.8 Hz), .delta. 1.43 (s, CH.sub.2polyisobutylene, 26H), .delta. 1.12 ppm (s, CH.sub.3polyisobutylene, 78H). SEC: M.sub.w859000 g/mol, PDI=2.76.
b) Synthesis of 4-nitrophenyl carbonate activated butyl rubber (10)
[0090] Epoxidized butyl rubber 8 (0.17 g, 0.2 mmol of epoxidized units) was dissolved in dry toluene (6 mL). An aqueous HCl solution (37%, 20 .mu.L, 0.2 mmol) was added to the epoxidized butyl rubber solution and the reaction was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature to form 9. Next, 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate (0.62 g, 3.1 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture followed by pyridine dropwise (0.30 mL, 3.6 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred 2 hours at room temperature. Pyridine salts were then removed by filtration and the resulting solution was precipitated with acetone twice (2:1, acetone/toluene) to obtain functionalized copolymer (10) (Yield=89%). .sup.1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl.sub.3): .delta. 8.28 (d, 2H, J=8.5 Hz), 7.40 (d, 2H, J=8.5 Hz), 5.28 (s, 1H), 5.13 ppm (s, 1H), 5.03 (s, 1H), 1.43 (s, CH.sub.2polyisobutylene, 26H), 1.12 ppm (s, CH.sub.3polyisobutylene, 78H). SEC: M.sub.w=1013000 g/mol.
