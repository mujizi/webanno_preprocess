[0031] As an alternative or in the case where the apparatus is provided with more than one opening the method further comprises mounting an antenna in an opening in the wall of the flange assembly, which antenna communicates wirelessly with the signal processing unit in the flange assembly.
[0032] In an embodiment of the apparatus for monitoring parameters there is provided one or more batteries or battery packs, which provide necessary power as required. However, this can also be accomplished by connecting the apparatus to one or more power supplying wires.
[0033] As stated in the introduction of the description, the invention also includes a method for retrieving an apparatus for monitoring physical parameters in the annulus of an oil and/or gas well having a well head. The apparatus may be installed in accordance with the installation method as mentioned above. The constructional features of the apparatus as described above also applies for the apparatus in accordance with this method and is therefore not repeated here. The method for retrieving the apparatus comprises the following steps; Disconnecting a control cable or (depending on the sensor system in use) optionally remove battery in connection with the signal processing unit of the flange assembly. Removing the flange assembly from engagement with the well head, in the case where bolts/nuts are used as attachment means, releasing the nuts from the bolts. The method further includes the step of disconnecting a cable connector attached to the sensor plug, which cable connector is attached to an end of a cable connecting the sensor of the sensor plug to the signal processing unit in the bore of the flange assembly. And further the method comprises the step of connecting a valve structure to the well head in communication with the passage in the well head, which valve structure has an open and a closed position, and then removing the sensor plug through the valve structure in an open position using a valve removal tool structure.
[0034] As mentioned earlier the valve structure may be a gate valve or any other valve suitable for connection with the well head.
[0035] In accordance with one embodiment of the method the step of removing the sensor plug through the valve structure in an open position using a valve removal tool structure, further comprises the following steps; connecting the valve removal tool structure to the valve structure in its closed position, which valve removal tool structure has a valve removal tool provided with a socket for the sensor plug. Opening the valve structure and displacing a movable unit of the valve removal tool structure through the valve structure to engage the socket with the sensor plug in the passage of the well head. Removing the sensor plug by retracting the movable unit of the valve removal tool through the valve structure in its open position. As mentioned above the movable unit may comprise telescoping elements. The sensor plug may be released from the passage by screwing, in the case where the sensor plug is arranged with threads matching threads in the passage, thereby unwinding the sensor plug from the passage of the well head.
