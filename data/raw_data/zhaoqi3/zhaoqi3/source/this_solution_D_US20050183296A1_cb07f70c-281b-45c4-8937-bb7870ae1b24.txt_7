[0066] Another object of the invention that is also illustrated in FIG. 1, consists in that the said thermostatic means for regulating the temperature of the plate (1) and the vaporiser (2) comprise thermal sensors, of the plate (7) and the vaporiser (8). As explained above, these thermal sensors (7, 8) provide operation with great precision and speed that avoids the use of a second backup thermostat of conventional type for the vaporiser (2) and provides for the implementation of computer-programmable micro-processors (chips), and of LCD display screens, that show the working stages of the iron at any particular moment, and provides for more efficient and reliable ironing with the greatest accuracy in determining the correct temperature for each type of garment, and for greater speed in producing changes in the ironing temperature.
[0067] Another object of the invention is that the said holes (17) in the plate (1) are provided in a reduced number, concentrated at the front section of the plate (1) in arrow-head formation, and having the special feature of being open within grooves that extend to the rear section of the plate (1) each being in the form of channels (18). In particular, the preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 5 demonstrates that the said holes (17) and channels (18) are seven in number, the three central channels (18) extend to approximately the first third of the length of the plate (1), and the remaining four channels (18) extending to approximately a quarter of the length of the plate (1) measured from the extreme rear end of the plate.
[0068] This solution enables the garment to receive the required steam for the ironing procedure at the start of the motion of the iron, and that during the rest of this movement there will be a progressively increased degree of drying to total dryness, which results in an ironing procedure of professional quality.
[0069] With regard to the drawings and references listed above, a preferred embodiment with the claimed improvements in the present subsidiary patent, is illustrated in the attached plans. One of the objects of these improvements (FIG. 1) lies in that the existing ratio between the widths of the vaporisation chamber (3) and the plate (1) is in the order of three quarters, because the geometry of the said vaporisation chamber (3) is such that its sides are parallel to those of the said plate (1). In accordance with what has been outlined previously, it is now possible to confirm visually that there is a considerable increase in the volume of the vaporisation chamber (3) which, as can be seen from FIG. 8, benefits from the mesh (13) being substantially larger than previously and being able to accumulate larger quantities of lime from the water and, consequently, to facilitate a longer, useful life of the product, because it is lime deposits that cripple this type of iron.
[0070] Another object of this invention is that the said front opening (4) of the vaporiser (2) comprises a vertical tube (3a) the other end of which opens into an expansion chamber (1a) formed in the plate and for it to be closed below by a sheet (19) which is preferably made of stainless steel, and which covers the lower surface of the plate (1) as the element of contact with the garment to be ironed. This procedure is clearly illustrated in FIG. 7, especially in the enlarged details, where the situation of the gasket (16) can also readily be identified, and its position guarantees water-tightness between the vaporisation chamber (3) and the plate (1), against the circulating steam which, through the said expansion chamber (1a), ends up emerging via the holes (17) to the exterior of the plate (1) and its corresponding ones in the sheet (19), and that in respect of the present patent Number 200400197, it now becomes fully clarified. This variation to the vertical tube (3a) is also illustrated in FIG. 9.
