[0649] The function of G652 was also studied using transgenic plants in which the gene was expressed under the control of the 35S promoter. Overexpression of G652 resulted in plants that were small and slow developing. Many plants died at an early stage of growth. The two lines that were morphologically examined in the T2 generation were small and showed premature senescence of rosette leaves.
Utilities
[0650] G652 could be used to manipulate seed tocopherol composition and seed structure and to alter glucosinolate composition in leaves. Tocopherols have anti-oxidant and vitamin E activity. Increases or decreases in specific glucosinolates or total glucosinolate content might be desirable depending upon the particular application. For example: (1) Glucosinolates are undesirable components of the oilseeds used in animal feed, since they produce toxic effects. Low-glucosinolate varieties of canola have been developed to combat this problem. (2) Some glucosinolates have anti-cancer activity; thus, increasing the levels of composition of these compounds might be of interest from a nutraceutical standpoint. (3) Glucosinolates form part of a plants natural defense against insects. Modification of glucosinolate composition or quantity could therefore afford increased protection from predators. Furthermore, in edible crops, tissue specific promoters might be used to ensure that these compounds accumulate specifically in tissues, such as the epidermis, which are not taken for consumption.
[0651] Based on the overexpression data, G652 could be used to manipulate plant growth and development. In particular, the accelerated senescence of the 35S::G652 lines indicates that the gene could be used to modify disease responses, or alter the rate of senescence in crops.
