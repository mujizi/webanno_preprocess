[0290] First, the shaped diamond and binder are heated to from ambient temperature to about 500 degrees Celsius. The temperature is preferably increased by about 2 degrees Celsius per minute until about 500 degrees Celsius is reached. Second, the temperature of the bound and shaped diamond is maintained at about 500 degrees Celsius for about 2 hours. Third, the temperature of the diamond is increased again. The temperature is preferably increased from about 500 degrees Celsius by about 4 degrees per minute until a temperature of about 950 degrees Celsius is reached. Fourth, the diamond is maintained at about 950 degrees Celsius for about 6 hours. Fifth, the diamond is then permitted to return to ambient temperature at a temperature decrease of about 2 degrees per minute.
[0291] In some embodiments of the invention, it may be desirable to preform bound diamond feedstock by an appropriate process, such as injection molding. The diamond feedstock may include diamond crystals of one or more sizes, solvent-catalyst metal, and other ingredients to control diamond recrystallization and solvent-catalyst metal distribution. Handling the diamond feedstock is not difficult when the desired final curvature of the part is flat, convex dome or conical. However, when the desired final curvature of the part has complex contours, such as illustrated herein, providing uniform thickness and accuracy of contours of the polycrystalline diamond compact is more difficult when using powder diamond feedstock. In such cases it may be desirable to perform the diamond feedstock before sintering.
[0292] If it is desired to perform diamond feedstock prior to loading into a can for sintering, rather than placing powder diamond feedstock into the can, the steps described herein and variations of them may be followed. First, as already described, a suitable binder is added to the diamond feedstock. Optionally, powdered solvent-catalyst metal and other components may be added to the feedstock as well. The binder will typically be a polymer chosen for certain characteristics, such as melting point, solubility in various solvents, and CTE. One or more polymers may be included in the binder. The binder may also include an elastomer and/or solvents as desired in order to achieve desired binding, fluid flow and injection molding characteristics. The working volume of the binder to be added to a feedstock preferably will be equal to or slightly more than the measured volume of empty space in a quantity of lightly compressed powder. Since binders typically consist of materials such as organic polymers with relatively high CTE's, the working volume should be calculated for the injection molding temperatures expected. The binder and feedstock should be mixed thoroughly to assure uniformity of composition. When heated, the binder and feedstock will have sufficient fluid character to flow in high pressure injection molding. The heated feedstock and binder mixture is then injected under pressure into molds of desired shape. The molded part then cools in the mold until set, and the mold can then be opened and the part removed. Depending on the final polycrystalline diamond compact geometry desired, one or more molded diamond feedstock component can be created and placed into a can for polycrystalline diamond compact sintering. Further, use of this method permits diamond feedstock to be molded into a desired form and then stored for long periods of time prior to use in the sintering process, thereby simplifying manufacturing and resulting in more efficient production.
[0293] As desired, the binder may be removed from the injection molded diamond feedstock form. A variety of methods are available to achieve this. For example, by simple vacuum or hydrogen furnace treatment, the binder may be removed from the diamond feedstock form. In such a method, the form would be brought up to a desired temperature in a vacuum or in a very low pressure hydrogen (reducing) environment. The binder will then volatilize with increasing temperature and will be removed from the form. The form may then be removed from the furnace. When hydrogen is used, it helps to maintain extremely clean and chemically active surfaces on the diamond crystals of the diamond feedstock form.
[0294] An alternative method for removing the binder from the form involves utilizing two or polymer (such as polyethylene) binders with different molecular weights. After initial injection molding, the diamond feedstock form is placed in a solvent bath which removes the lower molecular weight polymer, leaving the higher molecular weight polymer to maintain the shape of the diamond feedstock form. Then the diamond feedstock form is placed in a furnace for vacuum or very low pressure hydrogen treatment for removal of the higher molecular weight polymer.
