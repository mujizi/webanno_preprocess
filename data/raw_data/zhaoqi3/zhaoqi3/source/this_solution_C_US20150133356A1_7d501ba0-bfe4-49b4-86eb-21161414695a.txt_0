[0008] In wafer level packaging, solder bumps can be formed using an electroplating process. Electrical contact for the plating step is made using a continuous Cu film to distribute the current across a wafer that is patterned with a photoresist mask. Metal is plated onto the copper surface in open features. After plating, the photoresist mask is removed and the continuous Cu film is etched from around the plated metal using a dilute acid solution to electrically disconnect the solder bumps.
[0009] The challenge remains to find a solution which cleans post etch residues, that is, residues created or resulting from an etching process (e.g. an acid and/or plasma etching process) which can include organic materials such as post etch degradation or damaged polyimide, new metal oxides formed such as SnO, and organometallic degradation products created from the plasma etching process such as from etching the Ti layer and/or the Sn etch products (collectively the post etch residues).
[0010] It is also desirable that this solution not only clean and remove photoresist post etch residues, but also maintains compatibility with permanent wafer features, such as metals comprising the solder caps (e.g. SnAg) and the copper pillars. A solution which is incompatible with the wafer features can result in further undesirably etching these metal surfaces including the copper pillars and solder bumps, resulting in yield loss.
[0011] The solution also should remain stable as a solution during the cleaning process to avoid leaving behind residues. Although solid particulates can form as byproducts in the solution during the heating and cooling cycle or over time, the particulates should remain in solution and not precipitate out of solution. Any precipitate byproducts can remain as deposits on wafer surface and production equipment. Thus, the solution should be stable at elevated temperatures encountered during operation and when cooled back to room temperatures.
[0012] This application addresses a composition and a process for removing organic, organometallic, and metal oxides from semiconductor substrates that have their origin as photoresist residues and etching residues on wafer, solder bump walls, and the top surface of the solder bumps.
