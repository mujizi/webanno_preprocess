[0065] An advantage of the processes shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 is that both near and far targets may be read, without the need for manual selection between different modes. According to the process of FIGS. 3 and 4, the integrated optical reader 90 performs automatic switching between the modes, thus reducing the need for manual intervention in its operation.
[0066] In one preferred embodiment, when using both the flying spot front end 100 and the imaging front end 200 in an automated fashion, the operation of the two front ends 100, 200 is synchronized so that they are not operating simultaneously. The reason for this is because the flying spot laser beam traversing the target may interfere with collection of good data by the imaging front end 200. Thus, simultaneous operation of both the flying spot front end 100 and the imaging front end 200 may degrade performance of the imaging front end 200.
[0067] In an alternative preferred embodiment, a band-stop or "notch" filter may be installed in front of the imaging sensor in the imaging front end 200. Preferably, this notch filter rejects light with wavelengths that match the flying-spot laser, and passes most other wavelengths of light that can be sensed by the imaging sensor. In particular, the notch filter should pass most of the light that is used to provide illumination for the imaging front end. When such a notch filter is used, the operation of the flying-spot front end 100 will not interfere with the operation of the imaging front end 200, so both of those front ends can be operated simultaneously, provided that sufficient processing power is available is the controller 300. This processing power may be provided by a single microprocessor that is sufficiently powerful to handle both tasks simultaneously, or by providing two individual processors, one for each front end.
[0068] Optionally, data from the imaging front-end 200 may be used to confirm the validity of data obtained from the flying-spot front-end 100 or vice versa. This confirmation process can be used to decrease the probability of a reading error in cases where the barcode or other symbol can be successfully decoded, but the confidence level in the decoding result is low. Thus, if the flying-spot subsystem decodes a given barcode or other symbol with a low degree of confidence, an imaging read can be performed to verify the data. Then, if the imaging sub-system detects the same information for the given barcode or symbol, the original data reading can be accepted. This process is particularly advantageous when the data confidence is relatively low for both the imaging and flying-spot reads, but the combined confidence is high enough to be usable. For example, if the confidence in the imaging read is 90%, and the confidence in the flying-spot scan is 95%, the resulting confidence would be 1-(0.1.times.0.05), or 99.5%. If the level of confidence is sufficient, this process of confirmation can result in a successful scan from a pair of reading attempts that would otherwise be too unreliable to use.
[0069] In various other embodiments, the integrated optical reader 90 may first read using one reading method (e.g., using the flying spot front end 100), and then switch to the other reading method based upon data derived in a partial pattern recognition step (or a partial decoding step). In accordance with one such embodiment, the controller 300 causes data to be gathered using the flying-spot front end 100. The controller 300 then performs a partial pattern recognition (or partial decoding) step to search for indicia indicative of either a one-dimensional or two-dimensional code, symbol or indicia. The partial pattern recognition (or partial decoding) step takes less time than a full decode, because the particular value or specific information of the barcode or symbol is not needed at this stage of the processing. If initial processing of the gathered data indicates that the bar code (or other symbol or indicia) is one-dimensional, based, for example, on the feature ratios of a portion of the data, or by detecting a striped pattern, or by detecting certain key features (such as center and/or guard bands), then the controller 300 may continue to attempt to decode on the assumption that the target comprises a one-dimensional code, symbol or indicia, and may also instruct the flying spot front end 100 to continue to gather data continuously or periodically in case complete data was not initially read.
