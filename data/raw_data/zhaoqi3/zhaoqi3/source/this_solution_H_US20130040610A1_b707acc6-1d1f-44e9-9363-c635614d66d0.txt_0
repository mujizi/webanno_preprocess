[0003] Recently, users are turning to more sophisticated personal digital assistants (PDAs) rather than more basic network-connected devices such as cell phones. Mobile phones that have the capability to send and receive data via data subscriptions to a network have become more prevalent. The capabilities of these mobile phones, often referred to as "smart phones", have led to them being viewed more as mobile computers rather than simplistic communication devices. Smart phones also often feature short range wireless transmitters and protocols, such as Bluetooth, specifically designed for communicating with other devices or accessories nearby.
[0004] Bluetooth watches in the past have been provided which support caller ID and text messages. However, the information it displayed was brief as it was limited to a one-line display.
[0005] There exists a method for synchronizing data between a watch and an external digital device as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,977,868 to Brewer et al. This method requires the user to initiate the synchronization by contacting the watch display, which causes the microprocessor in the watch to activate and begin the synchronization process. Consequently, the user is not able to instantly check for new data by looking at the watch. The user must wait for the microprocessor to activate and complete the synchronization process prior to the information being displayed. This also means that the user may not receive new data in a timely manner, since this technology does not notify the user when there are updates available. Furthermore, this solution can require an "alignment device" to aid the wireless communication link between a watch and PDA. In this case, a high level of user interaction is required. Furthermore, the communication is a synchronization, which lengthens the time the wireless communication is active and negatively impacts battery life.
[0006] U.S. Pat. No. 6,714,486 to Biggs teaches a system and method for customized time display. Biggs is concerned with displaying time and other chronological data on a display of a portable timepiece. However, the data is sent to the display as image parameter data rather than raw text. The disadvantage of this is that a more complex hardware design is needed to support the memory required for storing and displaying image data.
[0007] U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,979 to Powell teaches a method of indicating an incoming call through a remotely located receiving device. This avoids situations where a cell phone would audibly ring at the same time as the external device vibrates, as they both indicate the same event of an incoming call. However, this solution only concerns the signalling of incoming telephone calls by an external device. There exists a switch for whether the incoming call is connected or disconnected to the audible signalling system of the transmitter.
