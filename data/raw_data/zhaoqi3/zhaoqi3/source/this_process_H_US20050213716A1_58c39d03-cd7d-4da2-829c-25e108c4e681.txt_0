[0080] Provisioning and Validation of VoIP Subscriber Location
[0081] One of the key issues of a VoIP 911 location service is related to how a subscriber's location information can be retrieved. In the current VoIP industry standard, a VoIP subscriber is required to register in the customer VoIP switch 404. During this process, the subscriber's location information can be recorded in the customer VoIP switch 404.
[0082] However, conventionally there is an issue regarding how the location information can be used by the VoIP Location Server 400. In addition, the location information (street address etc.) may be incorrect (e.g. typo etc.) because of the need for entry of the location during registration, so validation is desirable. Aspects of the present invention as illustrated herein provide a solution for these issues. A simple HTTP based protocol is defined as such that the CP Office 307 of a local VoIP service provider can push the subscriber location information to the VoIP Location Server.
