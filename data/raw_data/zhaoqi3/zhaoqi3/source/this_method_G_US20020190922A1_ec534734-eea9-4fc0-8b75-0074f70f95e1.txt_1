[0041] In the previous paragraphs, Pattern Projection technique is described by examples of color illumination over different sub-panels in order to project images of many colors. Illuminations of the same color (e.g. white) but with scaled intensity can be applied to different sub-panels to create images of many gray levels. For example, referring to the setup of FIG. 2a, the light intensity of each of the four separate paths (201A, 201B, 201C and 201D) can be scaled as 8:4:2:1 by inserting aperture stops of proper openings into the four paths. As a result, the four sub-panels illuminated by the four paths also have the 8: 4: 2: 1 brightness scale, as illustrated in FIG. 6a. A composite pixel 6301 comprising four sub-pixels can therefore display a composite brightness of 16 gray levels (0-15) by the combination of the four sub-pixels, each of a different brightness. This method can be called "Scaled Illumination".
[0042] Besides scaling illumination intensity over different sub-panels, scaled illumination can also be applied to adjacent pixels on an SLM by a single light pattern. For example, as shown in FIG. 6b, each light spot 100 in an illumination pattern illuminates four adjacent sub-pixels at an off-set location such that the illumination intensity on each of the four adjacent pixels is scaled as 1:2:4:8, as the numbers in each pixel indicate. Similarly, a rectangular illumination spot (which can be created by cross-stacking two arrays of micro- cylindrical lens) can also do this, as illustrated in FIG. 6c. If a pixel has 6 sub-pixels, it can have 64 gray levels, as shown in FIG. 6d. If the illumination pattern contains light stripes, each stripe can cover three rows of pixels and create an illumination scale of 1:2:4, as shown in FIG. 6e.
[0043] By methods described in previous paragraphs, the projected color images still contains the "look" of color triad structure, because each sub-panel on the display panel are physically separated by one or a few pixel pitches. This can result in undesirable artifacts in color images. Applying a projection and path-combination optical system, similar to the one that projects the light pattern onto the display panel, can merge the physically separated sub-panels and put R, G and B sub-pixels into one single pixel, that is, eliminating the look of color triads. The basic concept is illustrated in FIG. 7a. Since the path separation optics and combination optics are similar, only one set of separation/combination optical system 780 is needed if the display panel is of reflective types. Lens 120 projects the light pattern 100, which is generated by illuminating a pattern plate 110, onto the SLM 130 and projection lens 160 projects the image from the SLM onto the screen (not shown). The path separation/combination optics separates the illumination beam into multiple paths 781 leading to the display panel and partitions the display panel into four sub-panels 700. The same optics re-combines the images reflected from the four sub-panels and merges them into one single panel with each pixel comprising the superposition of four pixels each coming from a different sub-panel 790. FIG. 7b illustrates one example of this method. The path separation optics used in FIG. 3a are used as both path separation and combination optics. Lens 120a and 120b projects the light pattern on the pattern plate 110 onto the SLM 130, in four separated paths defining four sub-panels. Lens 120b and 160 act as projection lens and projects the re-combined images at a distance 180. The lens combination can be based on condenser lens or based on Schlieren optics. If desired, more then two components can be used in the lens combination and those components can be spread among the components of the separation/combination optics if necessary. A TIR prism 740 separates the illumination beam from the image beam. FIG. 7c illustrates another apparatus example using the path separation optics used in FIG. 3c. This setup uses two sets of 3 dichroic reflectors (331 and 332) to separate the light beam into R, G and B three paths. Each dichroic reflector reflects only a selected band of light (R, G or B) and passes the rest. Projection lens 120 projects the light pattern onto the display panel. The two sets of 3 dichroic reflectors are arranged as illustrated so that every path has the same length. (This is preferred when regular projection lens is used. If Schlieren projection optics are applied such that projection beams are collimated beams, then 3 dichroic mirror will be enough.) By adjusting the angle of each dichroic reflector, the three paths can be slightly offset to define three sub-panels. The image beams reflected from the display panel are re-combined and projected by projection lens 160. The three sub-panels are merged into one.
[0044] In the above description, the path/color separation and combination optics are placed between the SLM and the projection lens. This arrangement may require a large optical path length between the display panel and the projection lens. An alternative method is to place the separation optics before the SLM (i.e. upstream in the light path) and use path/color merging optics after the projection lens. FIG. 8a illustrates the general idea. In order to merge multiple sub-panels into one, each sub-panel must carry a different light property so that the merging optics can align the beam associated with each sub-panel independently. The merging of sub-panels can be based on their different colors (in the cases of making color projectors) or on their different polarization states (in the cases of projecting B&W or gray scale images). For example, FIG. 8b illustrates an optical setup wherein the illumination arrangement (using two sets of dichroic color mirrors) is similar to that of FIG. 3c, while the projection arrangement also contains two sets of dichroic color mirrors 333 and 334. By adjusting inclination angle of each of the dichroic mirrors, separate sub-panels can be aligned into a single one.
[0045] When sub-panels are illuminated with light of non-differentiable properties, the merging of sub-panels can be done by spatially de-coupling optical paths passing different sub-panels, guiding each path to a different reflector respectively, and then merging them by adjusting the angle of each reflector. FIG. 8c illustrates an example of optical setup. For simplicity, the illustration uses transmissive type of display panel. For reflective types, the principle is the same. Three separate illumination beams (801A-C) illuminate the SLM that has three pre-defined sub-panels. The alignment of each beam to its corresponding sub-panel is achieved by adjusting reflectors 820A-C. The incidence angles of the beams to the SLM are selected such that once the beams leave the display panel at a distance, they no longer overlap one another. Three lens 160A-C are used to project the images on the display panel, with each projection lens receiving one beam from one sub-panel respectively. As a result, each projection lens can project images from only one sub-panel, not another two. The projection paths corresponding to each sub-panel are therefore also de-coupled spatially, no matter what color or polarization they carry. A system of reflectors 830 can therefore used to re-direct the projection paths and merge them at a distance.
