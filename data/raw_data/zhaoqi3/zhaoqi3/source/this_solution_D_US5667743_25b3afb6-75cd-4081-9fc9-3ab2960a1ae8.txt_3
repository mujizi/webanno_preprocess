This Example is intended to show the differences in the drawability of the fibers of the present invention and the development of mechanical properties of the fiber of the present invention over that of the prior art.
MPD-I polymer solution consisting of by weight 19.3% polymer solids, 9% CaCl2, about 1% water; the remainder of which was DMAc, was extruded through a spinneret into a coagulation bath. The coagulation bath contained by weight 20.4% DMAc, 40.8% Ca Cl.sub.2 and 38.9% water and was operated at 110.degree. C. The fiber bundle formed was treated with a conditioning solution of the following composition 40.8% DMAc, 10.7% CaCl.sub.2 and 48.4% water such that each filament was contacted by this solution. The conditioning solution was maintained at 38.degree. C. The conditioned filaments were drawable without difficulty and exhibited low draw tension. The wet draw was accomplished in a solution of 20% DMAc in water at a ratio of 4.31. After drawing, the fiber was washed in water and dried at 120.degree. C. The fiber was then crystallized at 405.degree. C., but without any stretching. The filaments developed the following physical properties: tenacity, 4.7 dN/tex (5.35 gpd); elongation, 29.1%, and modulus, 80 dN/tex (90.6 gpd) with a toughness factor, (TF) of 28.9.
For comparison the same spinning solution was wet spun into a first and second coagulation solution as is taught in Japanese Patent Publication Kokou Sho 56-5844 (please see FIG. 1 for a comparison of the solution concentrations of the present invention with those taught in Kokou Sho 56-5844). The composition of the first coagulation solution was by weight 20.6% DMAc, 41.7% Ca Cl.sub.2 and 39.7% water and was operated at 110.degree. C. Following the first coagulation solution the fiber bundle was contacted with a solution (the second coagulation solution at 36.degree. C.). This second coagulation solution was applied in the place of, but using the same techniques of application as the conditioning solution of the present process. The composition of this second coagulation solution was formulated as taught in Sho 56-5844 to continue to cause solvent to leave the filament structure. This solution was formulated at the high end of the solvent concentrations taught in the publication since lower concentrations of solvent would have an even higher concentration gradient causing greater concentrations of solvent to leave the fiber. The composition of this second coagulation solution was 20.4% DMAc, 5.5% Ca Cl.sub.2 and 74.1% water. This solution was applied to the fiber bundle using the technique of application of the conditioning solution of the present invention. The filaments, formed from the combination and concentrations of solutions as taught in the reference, would not draw in the wet draw step of the present invention. The fiber tension was high and the filaments were broken during the attempt to wet draw them at a ratios equal to and below that of 4.31. Thus, the fiber could not be processed further.
This comparison shows that it is impossible to use the second coagulation bath as taught in the prior art to produce a fiber that is wet drawable. In this comparison the fiber of the present invention was fully drawn in a single step that immediately followed the conditioning step. There was no additional stretching in any subsequent process steps, yet the mechanical properties produced by the present process are comparable to those achieved in the spinning and processing of fiber by dry-spinning or low salt and salt-free wet spinning.
