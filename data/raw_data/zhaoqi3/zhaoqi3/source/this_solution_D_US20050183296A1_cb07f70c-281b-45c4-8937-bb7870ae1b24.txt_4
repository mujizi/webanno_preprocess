[0023] Another feature being claimed by this subsidiary patent is that the said front opening of the vaporiser comprises a vertical tube whose other open end penetrates an expansion chamber provided in the plate, and which is closed underneath by a sheet that is preferably made of stainless steel and which covers the lower surface of the plate as the element in contact with the garment being ironed. This solution has been demonstrated to be more convenient since the plate is less prone to be subject to possible blockage by lime accumulation.
[0024] A possible variant to the above consists in that the said front opening of the vaporiser has a vertical duct that is sealed at its other end, and has lateral openings that communicate with an expansion chamber situated in the plate and is sealed underneath by a sheet which is preferably made of stainless steel, and covers the lower surface of the plate as the element of contact with the garment being ironed.
[0025] Another object of the present subsidiary patent is that the interior of the vaporisation chamber contains at least one partition that extends over its entire height, and is attached to one of the side walls thereof but without reaching the opposite side wall. As will be shown below, a preferred embodiment contains two such partitions. This solution attempts to prevent the passage of the generated steam towards the plate from being too direct, so that it ensures that the steam emerging will not drag with it still liquid water which is present with the steam at a specific stage of the vaporisation procedure, until the pre-set temperature, at which all the water in the vaporisation chamber has been vaporised, has been reached.
