[0004] Given the ever increasing number of airplanes at the sky, bird strikes are becoming more of a problem every year. Nowadays, dozens of airplanes suffer bird strikes annually, of which many suffer from physical damage to the airplane while some of these accidents even result in fatal encounters.
[0005] On Oct. 4, 1960, Eastern Air Lines Flight 375 flying from Boston encountered a flock of common starlings during takeoff. This incident resulted in damage to all four engines and consequentially to a crashing of the plane shortly thereafter into Boston harbor. Of 72 passengers, 62 people lost their life in this incident.
[0006] Annual cost of this problem in the U.S. only is estimated at $400 million and even more. All the more so, bird strikes resulted in hundreds of worldwide deaths. While bird strikes happen most often at low altitudes, and especially during takeoff or landing (or during low altitude flight), the problem is not limited to low altitudes only, and bird strikes occurred at much higher altitudes, even higher than 30,000 feet. It should be noted that bird strikes at low altitudes may not give a pilot sufficient time to recover from the event, and thus crashes are even more likely.
[0007] While birds may strike airplanes in various ways, due to the velocity of the airplane which is much higher than that of the birds, birds usually impact airplanes at forward-facing faces of the airplane, such as cone, wing front edges, and most problematically jet engine cowling or inlets. Collisions of birds into engines of airplanes are extremely dangerous, because of the sensitivity of the engines, due to their design, to any significant impact. The fast rotation of the blades only increases that problem. Even more hazardous than encounters with individual birds are strikes by flocks of birds.
[0008] Conventional art counter measures are of the following types of solution--design of airplanes or parts thereof to be resistant to bird strikes (e.g. engines of large commercial jet are usually designed to securely shut themselves down after being hit by a bird, and while not designed to operated thereafter, residual damage which may result from displacement of blades for example, is restricted), removal of airplanes from the way of birds (e.g. by education of pilots, by restricting takeoffs and landing in view of birds migration patterns, etc.), and moving birds away of airports and airplanes (e.g. using scaring devices like sounds, lights, decoys, etc.).
