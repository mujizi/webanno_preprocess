[0094](Reason 3 for Mixing) There is a difference in FMP production periods. Even if the devices are produced by the same vendor, a storage capacity that can be contained in a FMP differs because of progress in semiconductor technology. Therefore, even when FMDs of the same capacity are supplied from the same vendor, the number of FMP installed in an FMD may be different. As a result, where an FMD replacement operation is conducted as a maintenance operation, when the devices of the same capacity are supplied from the same vendor, the number of FMP differs if the production periods are different. More specifically, for example, in the case where FMD with different production dates are mixed, when maintenance is conducted, the FMD with the oldest production data is sometimes replaced with the FMD of the latest production date that is not present in the storage system.
[0095]The storage system 1000 may also have a configuration in which FMD 1030 and HDD are mixed (not shown in the figure). In this case, because I/O characteristics (for example, random access of sequential access, a large number of write requests or a large number of read requests) differ between the HDD and FMD 1030, a parity group can be configured of HDDs and a parity group explained in the present embodiment can be configured with respect to FMD. In other words, a parity group of HDD and a parity group of FMD may be co-present in one storage system 1000.
[0096]Furthermore, depending of the direction of technological progress in the future, the performance (for example, processor performance) of controller located in the flash memory package, rather than the number of flash memory packages, can become a bottleneck for the I/O performance of FMD. To resolve this problem, a portion associated with the number of flash memory packages relating to information or processing that is explained hereinbelow may be replaced with the performance of controller located in an FMD. For example, a method can be considered by which the performance of controller inside FMD is provided to the outside and the controller 1010 configures a parity group of FMD with the same (including not only identical, but also close) controller performance inside an FMD.
