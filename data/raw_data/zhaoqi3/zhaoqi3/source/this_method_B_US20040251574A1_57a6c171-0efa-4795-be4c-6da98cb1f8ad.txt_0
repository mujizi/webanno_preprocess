[0027] The conceptual view in FIG. 3 illustrates why the object (110) in FIG. 2 exhibits two differently colored regions (112, 114). The cross section (120) in FIG. 3 is formed by depositing drops of binder and differently colored ink in a plurality of predetermined locations to form the cross sectional layer of the object. Magenta colored binder/ink drops are shown as circles with upwardly sloping lines (122) while cyan colored binder/ink drops are shown as circles with downwardly sloping lines (124). The two sets of drops are distinguishable from each other because the dispensing members were misaligned. The cross section (120) exhibits a magenta color on the left and bottom edges while exhibiting a cyan color on the top and right edges. The desired blue color is exhibited where the two colors overlap but at the edges there is no overlap because of the misalignment. With reference to FIG. 2, when several of the cross sections are stacked to form the object (110), the blue color is hidden and only the hue shifted magenta (112) and cyan (114) regions are visible to an observer. The misaligned dispensing members produce objects with undesired, hue-shifted colors. Additionally, the misaligned dispensing members result in rough surfaces and inaccurate dimensions.
[0028] It is possible to prevent or minimize the color hue shift at the edges of the object by defining the object borders with a single dispensing member and by dispensing the colored ink beyond the borders of the object.
[0029] FIG. 4 illustrates a cross sectional layer (130) of an object formed according to one aspect of the invention. The drops of binder (136) are ejected from a single first dispensing member and the drops of ink (132,134) are ejected from a second dispensing member. The second dispensing member should be understood to mean at least one dispensing member while it may comprise more than one dispensing member. In this method, the coloring of the object is performed by the second dispensing members, which over-dispenses the single first dispensing member. Over-dispensing is when the second dispensing member dispenses to cover an area larger than the area covered by the single first dispensing member, as shown in FIG. 4.
[0030] In one aspect of the invention, a binder is released from the single first dispensing member and inert ink is released from the at least one second dispensing member. In this example, the binder is a one part binder released from the first dispensing member. As described above, the first dispensing member releases binder (136) in the area that forms the cross-sectional layer of the object and the second dispensing members ejects ink (132, 134) and over-dispenses the first dispensing member. In this example, the ink released from the second dispensing member does not cooperate in the binding of the powder material. According to this example, the first dispensing member forms a bound region in each successive cross sectional layer to form the object. Because there can be no member-to-member misalignment when only one dispensing member is used to facilitate binding, the edges of the object will be smooth. Additionally, because the second dispensing members over-dispense the first dispensing member, the color extends beyond the borders of the object so that the undesired color hue shifting occurs in powder that does not make up part of the object.
[0031] In this example, the binder may include a UV curable resin. Such UV curable resins include those resins and methods described in U.S. patent applications US2002/0008333 and US2002/0016386. The disclosures of these applications are incorporated entirely herein by reference. When UV curable resins are used, the resin is deposited on the powder material. Then, before depositing the next layer of powder, the object is exposed to UV energy to facilitate curing. The ink used in this example is dependent on the resin selected for use as the binder. One of skill in the art will recognize that the surfactants and pigments can be selected to comprise a solvent system in which the binder will mix. One of ordinary skill in the art can select a solvent system that is stable and mixes well with the binder selected.
