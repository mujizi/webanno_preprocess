[0006]As the content data is transmitted by streaming from the server, the client sequentially stores (buffers) the content data in a buffer temporarily. At a point when a specified amount of the data has been stored, the client reads the content data from the buffer and starts playing back the content. In a case where the client can handle only uncompressed digital data, the server decodes (expands) compressed digital data that has been compressed and encoded by an encoding system such as MPEG1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3) or the like, converts the data into uncompressed digital data, such as linear PCM data or the like, and transmits the data to the client.
[0007]Incidentally, it is conceivable that the content playback system could be configured such that a plurality of the clients are connected to the network and that each of the plurality of the clients receives the content from a server device and plays back the content. For example, in a home network where one client is installed in the living room and another client is installed in a bedroom, suppose that a user who was listening to music content on the client in the living room wants to move to the bedroom and continue listening to the music content in the bedroom. In that case, even though the user is playing back the same content that is on the same server, the user must perform a separate series of operations for each of the two clients, selecting the music content on the server, setting the playback mode, starting the playback, and the like. The user operations are thus cumbersome.
[0008]A technology that pertains to this problem is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2005-242667. For each user, the technology registers setting information related to the music content playback operation in a setting information table on the server. In a case where the same playback operation is restarted on a different client, the technology makes it possible to call up the setting information that is registered on the server by pressing an operation key that corresponds to the desired playback operation, thus making it possible to restart the playback operation by a comparatively simple operation.
[0009]However, the technology described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2005-242667 registers on the server the playback operation setting information from each client. Therefore, the technology cannot be used unless a server is installed that has a registration function for the setting information. Moreover, in a case where the server that distributes the content and the server on which the setting information is registered are separate servers, the technology cannot be used unless the server on which the setting information is registered is in operation. For example, many manufacturers provide a wide variety of server models that conform to the DLNA standards, and it cannot be expected that all of these servers will be provided with the registration function for the setting information.
[0010]Furthermore, with the technology described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2005-242667, even if the setting information is registered on the server, each client must operate separately to perform the playback operation, so there is room for improvement. The technology is also not capable of providing a continuous, seamless playback operation in real time between the clients.
