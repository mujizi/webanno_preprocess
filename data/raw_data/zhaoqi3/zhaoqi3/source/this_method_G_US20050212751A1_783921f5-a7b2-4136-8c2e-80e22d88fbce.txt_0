[0065] As an example, a motion response module which modifies display 12 based on motion detected at motion detector 22, may have a mode of operation in which it awaits a trigger for switching to another mode of operation in which motion sensitivity is enabled. When motion sensitivity is not enabled, any motion of the device may be disregarded. The trigger may also set a zero-point for the device. When the zero-point is set, the motion response module may measure a baseline orientation of the device based on measurement from motion detection components. The baseline orientation may comprise the position of the device (determined from information from motion detector components) when the trigger is received. Future movement of the device will be compared against the baseline orientation to determine the functions to perform or the modifications which should be made at display 12 based on the user's motion of the device.
[0066] Particular embodiments provide for any number of user-initiated actions to act as a single trigger for zero-point selection and selective engagement/disengagement of the motion sensitivity of the device. Such actions may include, for example, the pressing of a key on input 14, moving device 10 in a particular way (e.g., movement corresponding to a particular gesture), and tapping display 12. It should be understood that any user-initiated action may set a zero-point and engage motion sensitivity of the device at the same time.
[0067] In some embodiments, a period of inactivity or minimal activity (i.e., relative stillness) may also set a zero-point and engage or disengage motion sensitivity. FIG. 7 illustrates a flowchart 80 for the passive setting of a zero-point for a handheld device. Change in acceleration with respect to an x-axis is detected at step 82a, change in acceleration with respect to a y-axis is detected at step 82b and change in acceleration with respect to a z-axis is detected at step 82c. At steps 84a, 84b and 84c, it is determined whether any acceleration change detected is greater than a particular respective threshold. If detected acceleration change along each of the three axes is not greater than a set threshold, then the device may be considered at rest, and at step 86 a zero-point will be set. An at rest position may be determined, for example, from stabilization of the raw data or motion components of components of motion detector 22. However, if detected acceleration change along any of the three axes is greater than a set threshold, then the process returns to acceleration change detection at steps 82. Thus, this method of passively setting a zero-point may ensure that when the handheld device is at rest, a zero point will be set. Moreover, if a device is in constant motion but not being moved by a user at a particular time (e.g., resting in a train moving at a constant speed), a zero-point will be set since there will be no detected change in acceleration. The use of thresholds to determine whether an acceleration change is high enough so as not to trigger the setting of a zero-point enables a user to hold the device still to passively set the zero-point. Otherwise, this may be difficult since a device with highly sensitive accelerometers may detect acceleration change as a result of very minor unintended, user-initiated movement. It should be understood that similar methods may be used in connection with motion detectors with components other than accelerometers. Thresholds may also be used in such similar methods to account for small, unintended movements that may otherwise prevent setting of a zero point.
[0068] Particular embodiments of the present invention include the ability to allow a user to repeatedly selectively engage and disengage the motion sensitivity of the handheld device in order to allow greater movement through a virtual desktop (or information space) using motion input in a limited amount of physical space. This process can be analogized to "scrubbing" with a mouse controlling a cursor, or lifting the mouse off of a surface and replacing the mouse on the surface at a different location to allow greater movement of the cursor. Lifting the mouse breaks the connection between the motion of the mouse and the motion of the cursor. Similarly, a user may be able to engage and disengage the connection between the motion of a handheld device, such as device 10, and the operations, functions or actions based on movement of the device.
[0069] FIG. 8 illustrates an example of the use of scrubbing functionality to navigate across a virtual desktop, or information space, larger than the display of a handheld device. In the illustrated example, a handheld device is used to navigate through virtual desktop 90. Virtual desktop 90 is illustrated as a grid map and may represent any suitable information through which a user may desire to navigate. Information of virtual desktop displayed at the handheld device is represented by box 92. In this embodiment, translation of the handheld device is used to navigate through virtual desktop 90. For example, a user may move the handheld device from right to left to navigate from right to left through information of virtual desktop 90. It should be understood that while the example illustrated describes moving the device to the right to implement the scrubbing process, it should be understood that handheld devices of particular embodiments may be moved in any suitable manner to implement the scrubbing process.
