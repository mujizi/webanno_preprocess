Each individual shaft may be rotated by a motor, which is coupled to the shaft axle by a gear train. The successive drive units move the wafer carrier along the track through the individual processing stations. The length of the carrier is dimensioned so that when the carrier passes between successive housings, the spiral magnetic drive unit of the former housing drives the back end of the carrier forward while the spiral magnetic drive unit of the next successive housing magnetically engages the front end of the carrier to continue its forward linear translation through the successive processing station. Alternatively, one shaft may extend under all of the housings to move the carrier through the wafer processing lines.
While one embodiment of the present invention utilizes a rotating magnetic shaft having one spiral magnetic drive extending around the shaft, alternative embodiments utilize a plurality of magnetic drives wrapped spirally around the same shaft to interleave with one another. Preferably, each magnetic drive of the plurality originates its spiral path around the shaft at a point on the periphery of the shaft end which is equidistant from the origination points of the other adjacent spiral drives. The multiple spiral drives also preferably maintain equal lead angles with respect to the longitudinal shaft axis and each other so that they do not intersect. A plurality of drives results in spiral sections having closer spacing so as to produce a smoother translation of the wafer carrier along the track as the shaft rotates. Another embodiment might decrease the lead angle of a single spiral drive to decrease spacing between adjacent drive sections and provide a smoother translation of the wafer barrier.
Compared to prior wafer translating mechanisms, this wafer translating mechanism is simple, clean and results in reduced particulate generation from frictional mechanical components. For example, silicone wafer processing equipment for LSI and VLSI applications requires a cleanliness level of less than 0.01 to 0.30 micrometers or larger size particles per cm.sup.2 of substrate surface. In such an application, a sputtering system is used for aluminum metallization. Because this process is particularly sensitive to particles generated from frictional forces, the system used cannot employ internal mechanical components which generate particles due to frictional forces. However, the present invention is very suitable to such an application.
Another advantage of this invention relates to its ease of maintenance. All of the major drive components associated with the translating mechanism are located outside of the vacuum processing housings and can be easily reached for service, repair or replacement without breaking the vacuum or requiring entry into any of the separate processing stations or housings. Furthermore, with a minimum amount of moving parts, and the absence of a belt or track which may stretch length as it is used, the present invention does not require constant maintenance or adjustment. Even when maintenance or adjustment is required, it will generally be simple, quick and accurate. This increases the up time of the equipment and decreases the time associated with service, repair and replacement. The net result is an overall increase in productivity for the wafer processing line.
These and other features of the invention will be more readily understood in view of the following detailed description and the drawings.
