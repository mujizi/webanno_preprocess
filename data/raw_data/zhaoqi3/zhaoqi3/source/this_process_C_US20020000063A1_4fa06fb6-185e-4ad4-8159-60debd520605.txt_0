[0009] Similarly, WO 96/23855 relates to the use of glycol ethers and esters as lubricity enhancing additives to fuel oils such as diesel. There is no mention of using any alcohols as such although several alcohols have been listed as being used to prepare the ethers and esters.
[0010] Like the WO 96/23855 above, U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,478 refers to the use of polyethers and esters of aromatic carboxylic acids in diesel fuels as additives. There is no mention of the use of any alcohols as additives.
[0011] U.S. Pat. No. 5,324,335 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,613 both in the name of the same assignee relate to fuels produced by the Fischer-Tropsch process which also contain inter alia alcohols formed in situ in the process which is recycled to the process. Whilst several primary alcohols are disclosed most of these are linear except the reference to methyl butanol and methyl pentanol. However, the streams recycled contain a considerable amount of other components such as, e.g., aldehydes, ketones, aromatics, olefins, etc. Also, the amount of alcohols generated by this process, especially the content of branched alcohols (<0.5%), appears to be very low in relation to the total stream recycled.
[0012] U.S. Pat. No. 5,720,784 refers to fuel blends and the difficulty in rendering diesel fuels miscible with the conventionally used methanol and ethanol. This document purports to mitigate the problem of miscibility by adding to such formulations a C.sub.3 (excluding n-propanol)-C.sub.22 organic alcohol. However, whilst the document refers to the use of higher alcohols to form single phase compositions which are not prone to separation, it is silent on the nature of the diesel fuel--for these can vary significantly in their composition from light naphtha to heavy duty diesel oils--nor indeed the effect of any of the alcohols referred to on the problems of particulate emissions when using such fuels in diesel fuel powered internal combustion engines. Furthermore, when addressing the issue of miscibility, it fails to distinguish between fuel compositions which contain the lower C.sub.1 and C.sub.2 alcohols and compositions which contain no lower alcohols.
[0013] WO 92/20761 discloses compositions comprising biodiesel in which the base fuels are predominantly esters and alcohols. There is no mention in this document of reducing particulate matter from emissions.
