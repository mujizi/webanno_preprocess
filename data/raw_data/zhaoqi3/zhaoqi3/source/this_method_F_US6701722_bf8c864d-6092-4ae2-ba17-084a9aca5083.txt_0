The outdoor unit 104 comprises an outdoor heat exchanger 122 and a compressor 118. The outdoor heat exchanger 122 is a device at which heat is transferred between the refrigerant and outdoor air. The compressor 118 sucks low temperature and low pressure refrigerant, and compresses the low temperature and low pressure refrigerant to make high temperature and high pressure refrigerant prior to discharging the refrigerant from the compressor 118. The outdoor unit 104 also has an outdoor expansion valve 128 which regulates pressure of the refrigerant flowing to the outdoor heat exchanger 122 during a heating mode operation. A four-way valve 130 is mounted on a refrigerant circulating line in the outdoor unit 104, and controls a flowing direction of an output refrigerant from the compressor 118 such that the output refrigerant flows to the outdoor heat exchanger 122 or the indoor heat exchanger 116 in accordance with a selected mode of the air conditioner.
Extending between the indoor unit 102 and the outdoor unit 104 of the air conditioner is the refrigerant circulating line (refrigerant pipe) which guides the flow of the refrigerant between the indoor unit 102 and the outdoor unit 104. Particularly in the case of a multiunit-type air conditioner having a plurality of indoor units 102, the refrigerant pipe is very long in length and somewhat complex in construction, and so by integrating a plurality of short pipes having an easily-handled length to each other to form a long and complex refrigerant pipe through, for example, a welding process is necessary. However, when the welding process is not effectively or sufficiently performed at welded junctions of the refrigerant pipe or when the refrigerant pipe is not properly managed after an installation of the pipe in the air conditioner, the refrigerant pipe may be broken at the welded junctions and undesirably allow a refrigerant leakage through the broken junctions. Further, repeated operation of the air conditioner over a lengthy period of time causes the refrigerant pipe to gradually become fatigued, and, in such a case, the refrigerant pipe may be loosened at connected junctions of the refrigerated pipe, thus allowing a refrigerant leakage through the loosened junctions. When the refrigerant leakage from the refrigerant pipe occurs, the air conditioner cannot perform an operation of the air conditioner. Therefore, in such a case, a user of the air conditioner must find positions of broken or loosened junctions of the refrigerant pipe to quickly repair the refrigerant pipe and restore a desired operation of the air conditioner.
The refrigerant leakage from the refrigerant pipe of an air conditioner has been detected by checking a variation in pressure of the output refrigerant from the compressor. However, this method only informs a user of an occurrence of the refrigerant leakage from the refrigerant pipe, but does not allow the user to find exact positions of the broken or loosened areas of the refrigerant pipe, and so the user cannot easily or quickly repair the broken or loosened refrigerant pipe. In the case of a multiunit-type air conditioner having a very long and complex refrigerant pipe, to find the exact positions of the broken or loosened areas of the refrigerant pipe is more important than to detect an occurrence of the refrigerant leakage from the refrigerant pipe. However, to find the exact positions of broken or loosened areas of the long and complex refrigerant pipe is very difficult. Particularly, in the case of a building with a centralized air conditioning system, the refrigerant pipe of an air conditioning system is typically installed in the building at the same time as constructing the building such that the refrigerant pipe is hidden in walls, ceilings and floors. Therefore, to find the exact positions of the broken or loosened areas of the pipe in the case of a refrigerant leakage is even more difficult.
Accordingly, an air conditioner and a method of detecting a refrigerant leakage in the air conditioner are provided, in which an entire refrigerant pipe of the air conditioner is sectioned based on expansion valves into a plurality of sections, and the sections are checked one by one to quickly detect a refrigerant leakage from the sections, as well as to find an exact position of a broken or loosened area of the refrigerant pipe causing the refrigerant leakage.
