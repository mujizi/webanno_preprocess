Permanent Drug-Eluting Stent with Absorbable Polymeric Coating Matrix and Incorporated Antiproliferative Immunosuppressant (Low Dose)
[0077] A 0.3% w/w solution of P4HB (TephaFLEX.RTM. biomaterial from Tepha, Inc. Mw 300-600K) and rapamycin (70/30% w/w, polymer/drug) in chloroform was prepared. Metallic coronary stents were spray-coated with this solution until a mean coating layer thickness of 15-20 micrometer was achieved. After 24 h storage under vacuum to remove the chloroform, the stents were mounted on standard balloon catheters and afterwards deployed to a nominal diameter of 3.5 mm. Rapamycin as the active agent was released from the coating.
