Absorbable Polymeric Matrix for a Drug-Elating Stent Coating
[0076] A 0.3% w/w solution of P4HB (TephaFLEX.RTM. biomaterial from Tepha, Inc., Mw 300-600K), in chloroform was prepared. Metallic coronary stents were spray-coated with this solution until a mean coating layer thickness of 15-20 micrometer was achieved. After 24 h storage under vacuum to remove the chloroform, the Stents were mounted on standard balloon catheters and afterwards deployed to a nominal diameter of 3.5 mm. Detailed electron micrographs of metallic stent struts coated with P4HB before and after stent dilation illustrate the smoothness and integrity of the coating before and after balloon expansion.
