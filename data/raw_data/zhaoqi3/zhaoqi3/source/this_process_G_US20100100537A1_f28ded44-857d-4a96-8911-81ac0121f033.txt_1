[0106] This process is further illustrated diagrammatically in the example of FIG. 5. The down-weighting allows negative feedback looping to mitigate the effect of false positives. Since the probability that an active agent contacts an agent evaluating the same word/phrase increases with cluster size, the down-weighting keeps groups from growing too fast and activating more agents than needed.
[0107] For a second agent that has evaluated a phrase/word and remains in the first state (e.g., has not reached evaluation threshold), the analysis engine 228 selects another agent which is configured to use the same trending parameter for analysis as the second agent. The analysis engine 228 can detect whether the selected agent has reached evaluation threshold and if so, the engine 228 changes the state of the second agent to an activated state (e.g., second state). Furthermore, the analysis engine 228 can detect the candidate phrase/word (e.g., or "hypothesis") which the selected trend analysis agent reached evaluation threshold with and such word/phrase is also assigned to the second agent such that the second agent is now in active same with the same phrase/word. However, if the selected agent also has not reached evaluation threshold, the state of the second agent is also maintained in the first state (inactive state).
[0108] This process can be repeated for all agents and is illustrated diagrammatically in the example of FIG. 5. A candidate phrase can be identified as a trended phrase based on the number or percentage of trend analysis agents that are active with the phrase/word (e.g., having reached threshold in the second state). The agents may have reached the active state through analyzing the phrase or through assignment based on the state of a neighboring agent.
[0109] One embodiment of the trending engine 214 includes a scoring engine 230 coupled to the trend analysis engine 228 and/or the trend identification engine 232. The scoring engine 230 can be implemented, for example, as software embodied in a computer-readable medium or computer-readable storage medium on a machine, in firmware, in hardware, in a combination thereof, or in any applicable known or convenient device or system. The scoring engine 230 can include any combination of hardware components and/or software agents able to weight the scores for a candidate phrase based on collective states of trend analysis agents in the trend analysis engine 228.
[0110] For example, the scoring engine 230 can determine a number or percentage of trend analysis agents that determines that the candidate phrase qualifies as the potential trended phrase, or the number or percentage of agents that have reached evaluation threshold (e.g., in a second state). Additionally, the scoring engine 230 can determine the number of differently configured types of trend analysis agents that determined that the candidate phrase qualifies as the potential trended phrase. Since the agents can be configured to analyze phrases using term frequency, document frequency, term occurrence frequency, click rate or other metrics, for example, candidate phrases with more agents of differing types that have reached threshold may typically correspond with stronger trends.
