Into 100 mL of a reclaimed spinning solution B containing 57.6% by weight of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, 2 g of each ion exchange resin (Amberlite IRA 416), active carbon power (Junsei chemical, purity 1 class) and active carbon bead (Samcheonli chemical, coal) was added respectively and then gently stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The resin, the active carbon powder and the active carbon bead were filtered off, and AOOD values for the resulting filtered solutions were measured. The results are given as shown in the following Table 2.
EXAMPLE 1
Into 100 mL of a spinning solution A containing 30 % by weight of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, aqueous hydrogen peroxide was added in an amount of 3% by weight of hydrogen peroxide based on the total weight of the solution and then, kept at 70.degree. C. for a predetermined time. AOOD values for this solution were measured.
After reacting with the aqueous hydrogen peroxide from 120 to 360 minutes, the solution was mixed with each of active carbon powder and Amberlite IRA 416 in an amount of 2g/100 mL. Subsequently, the resulting solution was gently stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, and the resin and the active carbon powder were filtered off. AOOD values for the resulting filtered solutions were measured.
The results of measurement are given as shown in the following Table 3.
