The invention is also applicable to the control of active filters arranged at the harmonic filter 53 shown in FIGS. 3 and 8. With knowledge of the commutating currents Ik and the direct current I1, calculated by means of models of the type illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, the phase currents on the a.c. side of the converter can be easily reconstructed and a control signal according to the invention be generated in dependence thereon for control of the active filters arranged at the harmonic filter 53.
Especially as regards the embodiment shown, the invention can also be applied to the control of an active filter arranged at the passive filter 56 indicated in FIG. 8 between the electrode line and ground, and be extended to control active filters in a two-pole HVDC plant. In case of feedback control, it is advantageous to transform, in a manner known per se, the fed back currents into one pole mode and one ground mode component, whose disturbance contents are eliminated separately. This is illustrated in FIG. 9 in which a component-transforming member 86 is adapted to transform the sensed pole line currents I2 and a pole line current I22, sensed at the other pole, into one ground mode component IJ and one pole mode component IP. In this case, the ground mode component is adapted to constitute the actual value of the controller 85 whereas the pole mode component is adapted to constitute the actual value of a controller 85' which in FIG. 9 is only indicated in dashed lines. This controller 85', whose output signal is adapted to influence an active filter (not shown in the figure), can be arranged in the same way as described above for the controller 85 but its amplification must normally be adapted to the reflection phenomena in the line which are accentuated for the pole mode. An equivalent signal CE, formed according to the above description, can, of course, also be formed for the purpose of generating a control signal to the active filter which is influenced by the controller 85'.
An advantageous embodiment, especially in case of a feedback control, is to form the control deviation from a combination of several sensed state variables. A control deviation DUY1i, associated with each sensed first state variable Y1i, is then formed as the difference between a reference value YRi for the respective state variable and its sensed value Y1i, whereupon the control deviation DU is formed from a combination DUK=.SIGMA.Gi * DUY1i. The coefficients Gi then generally consist of transfer functions. Thus, it is advantageous to sense, in the first section A--A or in the second section B--B, both the voltage of the relevant section and the current which flows through that section and to calculate an equivalent disturbance voltage or disturbance current generator 62 as well as an equivalent internal impedance 61 for the disturbance source, as viewed from the first section A--A, or an equivalent disturbance voltage or disturbance current generator 62' as well as an equivalent internal impedance 61' for the disturbance source, as viewed from the second section B--B. The latter case is illustrated in FIG. 2C. FIG. 10 shows the signal-converting member 90 adapted to receive a value of the pole line current I2 and a value of the voltage UL between the pole line and the electrode line, measured by means of a voltage measuring device 26. The reference member 91 is supplied with a reference value IRs for current and a reference value URs for voltage and is adapted to form a control deviation DU of the form DU=(URs-UL)+ZI*(IRs-I2), where ZI is the value of the equivalent internal impedance 61' of the disturbance source. It has proved that this method generally renders the transfer function from control signal to sensed state variables independent of the properties of that part of the power network which lies between the first section A--A and the second section B--B, respectively, and the output lines. Within the scope of the invention the control deviations can also be formed in accordance with other criteria such that a desired target function for the power network is attained.
It is not necessary for all signal processing in the controller 85 to be controlled by a common pulse train S' generated by the synchronization member 88. Thus, for example, the signal-converting member 90, the reference member 91, the first summator 92, the first filter device 93 and the level control member 97 may be adapted to work asynchronously with the synchronizing pulses S. In other cases, for example when the disturbance source consists of a diode rectifier, the synchronization signal S must be generated from currents and/or voltages sensed in the power network. In the example with a diode rectifier, the discontinuities in the differential coefficient of the output voltage of the diode rectifier, which occur during commutation of the rectifier, may then, for example, be sensed and a pulse generating member be adapted to deliver pulses timely related to these discontinuities. Similarly, within the scope of the inventive concept, at least parts of the control member may be implemented by hard-wired circuits.
The control signal C1 can be formed as a sum of the control signal, generated in dependence on the equivalent signal, and a control signal generated in dependence on the output signal of the controller 85 but also in dependence only on the equivalent signal or in dependence only on the output signal of the controller 85. In the latter case, of course, it is sufficient that the fourth calculating member 84 be adapted to comprise the required signal adaptation members for adaptation between the output signal C1" of the controller and the control signal C1. These signal adaptation members can also be arranged in the controller, in which case the fourth calculating member is completely omitted.
