[0118] This heat quantity can be found by multiplying a difference between the temperature of cycle 7 or exchanger 10 before they start operating and the temperature at normal operation, and the heat capacity together. However, the temperature at the normal operation largely differs depending on sections. Thus the sixth embodiment adopts the temperature difference as a typical value between a temperature detected before the operation by hot water temperature detector 22 and the temperature set by temperature setter 23, then this typical value is multiplied by a coefficient for determining the heat quantity. The heat quantity determined by start-up setter 30 is the total heat quantity needed for the start-up, thus it is necessary to convert the quantity to a quantity per unit time for controlling compressor 2. For this reason, adder 26 adds the load of hot water supply calculated by second calculator 25 and the heat quantity set by setter 30 together, then this added quantity is divided by the maximum heating amount at the maximum rotation speed of compressor 2 for finding an operating time at this maximum heating amount. Next, the heating amount needed for this operating time is set as the maximum heating amount for compressor 2. When this operating time is over, adding of the heating amount set by start-up setter 30 is ended, and the operation is restored to that in the fifth embodiment.
[0119] As discussed above, in the sixth embodiment, the heat quantity corresponding to a delay in heat response of heat pump cycle 7 or heat exchanger 10 is added to the load of hot water supply, and compressor 2 is heated with the maximum heating amount by the heat quantity corresponding to the delay. In other words, load setter 18 in this embodiment includes start-up setter 30 that determines the heat quantity corresponding to the delay in heat response of heat pump cycle 7 or heat exchanger 10. When a necessary heating amount is set, this quantity set by setter 30 is added. As a result, heating control incorporating the compensation for the delay in heat response can be achieved when the hot water supply starts or the load of hot water supply changes, thereby minimizing the delay in heat response.
[0120] The heat quantity corresponding to the delay in heat response can be found by multiplying a temperature difference between a temperature detected before operation by hot water temperature detector 22 and a temperature set by temperature setter 23, and a coefficient together. This method needs no special detector, so that an inexpensive control can be expected.
[0121] In the sixth embodiment, the heat quantity corresponding to the delay in heat response can be found by multiplying a temperature difference between a temperature detected before operation by hot water temperature detector 22 and a temperature set by temperature setter 23, and a coefficient together. However, a temperature of heat exchanger 10, compressor 2, heat absorber 5 or a discharging section of compressor 2 in refrigerant flow path 1 can be used.
