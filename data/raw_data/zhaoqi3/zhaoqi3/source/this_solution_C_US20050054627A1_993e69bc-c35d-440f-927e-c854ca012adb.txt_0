[0518] Preparation A1: Synthesis of Benzyloxycarbonylamino-7-oxo-6-aza-bic-yclo[3.2.1]octane-6-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester
[0519] Preparation A1, Step 1: (1S,2R)-cis-2-Methoxycarbonyl-cyclohex-4-en-e-1-carboxylic acid (66.0 g, see Bolm et al. J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 6984-6991) was dissolved in dry acetone (815 mL) prior to the addition of triethylamine (43.4 g). This solution was cooled to 0.degree. C. and ethyl chloroformate (46.7 g) was added. The resulting solution was stirred 1 h before NaN.sub.3 (35.0 g) was added. The cooling bath was removed, and the reaction was warmed to rt overnight. All solid material was removed by filtration, and the solution was partially concentrated. Water was slowly added and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with ether. The combined organic layers were washed with water and brine before they were dried, filtered, and concentrated. The resulting oil (66.1 g) was dissolved in benzene (800 mL) and was warmed to a gentle reflux. After 4 h, the solution was cooled back to rt. Benzyl alcohol (37.5 g) and p-TsOH (1.5 g) were added, and the solution was warmed back to a gentle reflux overnight. After cooling to rt, the reaction was washed with NaHCO.sub.3 and brine, dried, filtered, and concentrated to give (1R,6S)-6-benzyloxycarbonylamino-cyclohex-3-enecarbo-xylic acid methyl ester (97.7 g). MS found: (M+H).sup.+=290.2.
[0520] Preparation A1, Step 2: A sample of (1R,6S)-6-benzyloxycarbonylamin-o-cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid methyl ester (91.4 g) was dissolved in MeOH (500 mL) prior to the dropwise addition of NaOH (25.3 g) in water (95 mL). After 3 h, the solution was partially concentrated and an Et.sub.2O/water mixture was added. The aqueous layer was separated and was acidified (pH.about.2) with concentrated HCl. The resulting mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were washed with water and brine before they were dried, filtered, and concentrated to give (1R,6S)-6-benzyloxycarbonylamino-cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid (72.7 g). MS found: (M+H).sup.+=276.2.
[0521] Preparation A1, Step 3: A sample of (1R,6S)-6-benzyloxycarbonylamin-o-cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid (72 g) was dissolved in CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 (750 mL) prior to the addition of CDI (50.9 g). After 2.5 h water was added, and the solution was extracted with CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2. The combined organic layers were dried, filtered, and concentrated. The resulting material was dissolved in CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 and ammonia gas was bubbled through the solution for 1.5 h. After stirring overnight, the majority of the solvent was removed and Et.sub.2O was added. The product precipitated as a white solid and was collected to give (1R,6S)-6-carbamoyl-cyclohex-3--enyl)-carbamic acid benzyl ester (61.5 g). MS found: (M+H).sup.+=275.3.
