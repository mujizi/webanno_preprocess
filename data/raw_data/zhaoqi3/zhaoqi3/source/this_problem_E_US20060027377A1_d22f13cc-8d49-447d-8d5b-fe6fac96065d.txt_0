[0013] The present invention relates to various apparatuses, systems and methods for controlling fluid flow in a well. One aspect of the present invention relates to a conduit having an aperture for communicating with a target reservoir and a one-way valve in the aperture. Other aspects of the present invention, which are further explained below, relate to improving injection well performance using valves, preventing cross-flow in multizone and multilateral completions, and other methods and apparatuses for controlling fluid flow in a well.
[0014] As an example, FIG. 1 illustrates a well 10 having a cased section 12 and an open hole section 14. A conduit 16, or liner, extends from a packer 18 positioned in the cased section 12 downward into the open hole section 14. At least a portion of the conduit 16 is perforated to define multiple orifices or apertures 20 therein. Mounted within each of the apertures 20 is a one-way valve or check valve 22. The check valve 22 may take a variety of forms. However, the one-way valve 22 acts to allow flow in one direction and restrict or limit flow in an opposite direction. Depending upon the application and aperture size and other factors, some of the apertures 20 may omit valves 22, for example, if some bidirectional flow is acceptable.
[0015] The arrows 23 in FIG. 1 illustrate the direction of flow in an injection application. In an injection application, fluid is injected into a well 10. For example, a common practice used to increase recovery of oil from a reservoir is water-flooding. Water is injected into the reservoir through an injection well 10 as a nearby producing well produces oil from the formation. The goal is to maintain reservoir pressure and to generate a sweep effect pushing the oil using the injected water. One problem often encountered in injection applications occurs when injected fluid flows back into the well 10 or when cross-flow occurs. Another problem occurs when an inline valve or a pump is shut suddenly. When this happens an over pressure wave is generated creating a water hammer. This wave, or water hammer, propagates downhole and "liquefies" the poorly consolidated sand of the formation. Each of these problems can create a sanding issue in which sand enters the well 10, progressively plugging the well 10 and requiring expensive cleaning operations. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed with standard sand control methods, such as sand screens, gravel packs, and expandable sand screens. However, by preventing the flow of fluids back into the conduit 16, the present invention prevents sanding and acts as a dampener in the water hammer scenario reducing the water hammer affect. Thus, one aspect of the invention is a method to dampen a wave by limiting the flow of fluid into a well 10 with valves 22 positioned in the conduit wall that respond to the flow of fluid (e.g., like a check valve 22).
[0016] The check valve(s) 22 in the conduit 16 allows fluid to flow from an interior 24 of the conduit 16 to its exterior 26 and, thus, into the target reservoir. However, the valve(s) 22 limits or prevents flow in the opposite direction, from the conduit exterior 26 to its interior 24.
[0017] FIG. 2 illustrates a conduit 16 or tubing for use in a well 10. The conduit 16 has substantially radial apertures 20 extending through its wall 28. Valves 22 are mounted in each of the apertures 20 and are adapted to limit or prevent flow therethrough. For example, in the injection example described above, the valves 22 could be one-way check valves that allow flow from the conduit 16 only (or at least limit inward flow). In other applications, the valves 22 may limit flow in the opposite direction (i.e., limit flow from the tubing). The valve 22 may take a variety of forms and may be mounted to the conduit 16 in a variety of ways. For example, the valve 22 may be mounted to the tubing by threaded connection, welding, interference fit, friction, detents, snap rings, or by any other connection technique. The valves 22 shown in the figure are generally flush with the exterior 26 of the wall 28, although they could extend from the wall 28 without departing from the scope of the present invention.
