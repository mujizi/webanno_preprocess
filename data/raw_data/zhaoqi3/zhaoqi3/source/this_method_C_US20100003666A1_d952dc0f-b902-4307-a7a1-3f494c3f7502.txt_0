[0028] For biomolecule recognition the most common methods employ fluorescence or chemiluminescent detection. In this scheme a recognition element with a label element is bound to a molecule of interest and unbound recognition element is removed by a method of washing (Marquette et al., Biosensors & Bioelectronics 2006, 21, 1424-1433). Thus a selective signal is produced only when binding occurs.. In most cases the recognition element is immobilized on a surface. These techniques usually require a complicated optical system with a light source, filter, and detector before a signal of binding is determined. In most cases a large microscope or microplate reader will be used for this purpose. A common commercial implementation of this technique is the ELISA (Engvall et al., Journal of Immunology 1972, 109, 129). For portable and cheap diagnostic systems purely electrical detection without optical transduction is desired. A variety of chip-based microfluidic devices have also been developed as diagnostic systems using optical or electrochemical transduction of biomolecule recognition (Yager et al., Nature 2006, 442, 412-418; Warsinke et al., Journal of Analytical Chemistry 2000, 366, 622-634). Here the system integration of optical components or repeatability of electrochemical measurements can be limiting.
[0029] Microparticles are often used as a stationary site for recognition element immobilization in macroscale (Yingyongnarongkul et al., Combinatorial Chemistry & High Throughput Screening 2003, 6, 577-587) and microfluidic assays (Verpoorte, E., Lab on a Chip 2003, 3, 60n-68n). This is because particles with different elements can be interchanged easily to conduct different assays and the surface area for immobilization is large leading to large optical signals that increase with decreasing particle size. However, microparticle or bead-based bioassays have been limited to fluorescent or colorimetric detection of binding.
[0030] One of the most typical bead based assay uses a `sandwich assay` (see FIG. 1), where an antibody is attached to the bead surface. An antigen, if it is specific to the antibody, will then bind to the beads. Then, a second antibody that is tagged with a fluorescent molecule is attached to the antigen, forming a `sandwich`. This method works well, but a second labeling step is required, and the fluorescence must be monitored with an optical system, a light source, and a photodetector.
[0031] Another method for detecting biomolecules and their interactions is the bead agglutination assay (Coombs et al., British Journal of Experimental Pathology 1945, 26, 255-266; Reis et al., Transfusion 1993, 33, 639-643). In this assay the aggregation of multiple beads or cells into clumps mediated by some biomolecular recognition event is usually detected as a change in the optical properties of a solution containing the suspended beads/nanoparticles. In this type of system the aggregation is very dependent on the ratio of microparticles/nanoparticles to molecule of interest (FIG. 2) and so will only lead to a positive detection if the concentration is within an optimum range. Macroscale methods can be utilized to increase this range, but require centrifugation and resuspension of aggregate (FIG. 3). These manual operations are not easily performed in a portable system, and are expensive and time consuming.
[0032] Flow cytometry (FC) and laser scanning cytometry (LSC) are some of the most widely used techniques for single cell analysis. Well characterized distributions of cellular behavior are often observed using flow cytometry. Briefly, this technique involves the hydrodynamic isolation of individual cells that have been previously labeled using fluorescent dyes that reveal information about the quantity of biomolecules of interest within that cell. A light source, filtering mechanism, and detector are present to observe these signals of individual cells. The technique is a very high throughput serial process, where in most cases cells are discarded after analysis.
