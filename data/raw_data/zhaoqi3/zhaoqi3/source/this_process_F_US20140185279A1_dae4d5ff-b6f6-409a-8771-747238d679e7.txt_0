[0004] When a LED is used as the light source of a lamp, heat generated from the LED should be effectively transferred to the exterior of the lamp because the LED diffuses a large amount of heat.
[0005] FIG. 1 illustrates a traditional general tubular LED lamp. The housing of the lamp can be prepared by assembling a hemispherical heat radiation section and a hemispherical light transmission section, and a LED device and power supply, respectively, can be installed as the light source inside the housing.
[0006] Generally, the heat radiation section of the LED lamp housing may be prepared by die-casting a metal material having excellent heat conductivity, such as aluminum. However, there can be problems associated with this process, such as high manufacturing costs and low productivity.
[0007] In addition, if the heat radiation section is prepared with metal materials, the weight of LED lamp can increase due to the weight of the metal materials. This can render the LED lamp unsuitable as a home lamp.
[0008] The heat radiation section and the light transmission section can also be assembled by mechanical fastening methods. This, however, can increase the likelihood of LED lamp malfunction due to penetration of moisture or/and water through the crack between connections.
