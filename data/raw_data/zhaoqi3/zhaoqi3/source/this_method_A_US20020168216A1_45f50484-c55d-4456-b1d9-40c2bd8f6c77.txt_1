[0504] (b) contacting the surface with a cleaning implement comprising a handle and a removable, pre-moistened cleaning wipe, preferably a pre-moistened cleaning wipe as described herein, to remove additional soil from the surface; and
[0505] (c) allowing the surface to dry without rinsing the surface with a separate rinse solution.
[0506] The utilization of a two-step floor cleaning method comprising a dry mopping step followed by a wet mopping step helps to improve the overall end result performance of a wet mopping system such as the cleaning implement described hereinbefore comprising a disposable cleaning pad. In addition to providing better overall end result, especially in regard to the filming and/or streaking and soil removal of the hard surface being cleaned, this method provides the potential to increase the area that could be cleaned with a single cleaning pad of the present invention and therefore increases the cleaning pad mileage. Increased cleaning pad mileage also leads to better consumer value.
[0507] The present two-step floor cleaning method can be executed in the context of a two-implement system--i.e. one cleaning implement for dry mopping/dusting and one cleaning implement for wet mopping--or the present method can be executed as an all-in-one mopping system--i.e. using the same cleaning implement for both steps. If the present method is executed using an all-in-one mopping system, additional benefits include greater convenience due to easier storage and potentially lower cost.
[0508] In addition, the present two-step floor cleaning method can optionally comprise an additional step, wherein the third step comprises polishing and/or buffing the surface to improve shine, and/or add a protective coating and/or soil repellence coating.
