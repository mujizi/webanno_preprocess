[0082]In the second embodiment described above, the triaxial stack 74 is produced by stacking the grid-patterned sheets 39 and the homogeneous sheets 33. Alternatively, a triaxial stack may be produced by stacking the grid-patterned sheets 39 and other grid-patterned sheets different from the grid-patterned sheets 39. Alternatively, a triaxial stack may be produced by stacking the grid-patterned sheets 39 and the above-described striped sheets 10.
[0083]In the second embodiment described above, the grid-patterned sheets 39 and the homogeneous sheets 33 have the same shape and the dimensions (length.times.width.times.thickness). However, the shape and the dimensions of the sheets are not necessarily the same. The grid-patterned sheets 39 and the homogeneous sheets 33 that have different shapes and dimensions may be stacked. By appropriately determining the shape and the dimensions of the grid-patterned sheets 39 and the homogeneous sheets 33, the outer shape of the ceramic structure 75 can be freely designed.
[0084]FIG. 14 shows an example in which the production method of the second embodiment is applied to an all-solid state rechargeable battery 95. In FIG. 14, a biaxial stack 54 prepared by using the uniaxial stack 60 shown in FIG. 8 is cut in the X-Y plane. Thus, grid-patterned sheets 89 are produced. The biaxial stack 54 includes striped sheets 50 and homogeneous sheets 55. Each of the striped sheets 50 has a structure in which units each including a first layer 51 made of a positive electrode material, a second layer 52 made of a solid electrolyte material, a third layer 53 made of a negative electrode material, and a second layer 52 made of the solid electrolyte material are stacked. The homogeneous sheets 55 are made of a solid electrolyte material. The biaxial stack 54 is produced by alternately stacking the striped sheets 50 and the homogeneous sheets 55 in a direction (Y direction) orthogonal to the stacking direction of the layers 51 to 53. Accordingly, each of the grid-patterned sheets 89 obtained by cutting the biaxial stack 54 in the X-Y plane has a structure in which striped blocks 87 and homogeneous blocks 88 are stacked in the Y direction. In each of the striped blocks 87, first pieces 81 made of the positive electrode material, second pieces 82 made of the solid electrolyte material, third pieces 83 made of the negative electrode material, and second pieces 82 made of the solid electrolyte material are stacked. Each of the homogeneous blocks 88 is made of the solid electrolyte material. Each of the first pieces 81 is a segment obtained by cutting the first layer 51. Each of the second pieces 82 is a segment obtained by cutting the second layer 52. Each of the third pieces 83 is a segment obtained by cutting the third layer 53. Each of the homogeneous blocks 88 is a strip-shaped segment obtained by cutting the homogeneous sheet 55. In addition, homogeneous sheets 92 made of a solid electrolyte material are also prepared as other sheets different from the grid-patterned sheets 89. Subsequently, the grid-patterned sheets 89 and the homogeneous sheets 92 are alternately stacked in a direction (Z direction) orthogonal to the stacking direction of the pieces 81 to 83 of the striped blocks 87 and the stacking direction of the striped blocks 87 and the homogeneous blocks 88 so that adjacent grid-patterned sheets 89 are shifted in the vertical direction and the first pieces 81 and the third pieces 83 of the adjacent grid-patterned sheets 89 face each other. Thus, a triaxial stack 94 having stacking axes in three directions (X direction, Y direction, and Z direction) is produced. This triaxial stack 94 has a structure in which the first pieces 81 and the third pieces 83 are arrayed in a checkered pattern in the Z direction. The triaxial stack 94 is then fired to produce the all-solid state rechargeable battery 95. This method can provide the all-solid-state rechargeable battery 95 having a structure in which six negative electrodes face a single positive electrode, with the solid electrolyte therebetween.
Example 1
[0085]In Example 1, a method of producing an SOFC using a biaxial stack will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 7. In this example, a fuel electrode material tape that contained a NiO--YSZ mixed material as a main component and that had a thickness in the range of 10 to 50 .mu.m was used as a first raw material sheet 21. A removable material tape that contained a theobromine material as a main component and that had a thickness of 100 .mu.m was used as a second raw material sheet 22. The tapes of these materials were prepared by using a slurry containing a binder, a plasticizer, and the like by a doctor blade method. As shown in FIG. 1, the first raw material sheet 21 and the second raw material sheet 22 constituted a unit, and 50 units of these sheets were stacked in the X direction. These sheets were then bonded by thermal compression at 80.degree. C. under a load in the range of 5 to 30 kgf/cm.sup.2. Thus, a uniaxial stack 20 was produced. The uniaxial stack 20 was cut along the first stacking direction X with a dicer to prepare striped sheets 10 each having a thickness of 200 .mu.m. A fuel electrode material tape having a thickness in the range of 10 to 50 .mu.m was prepared as a homogeneous sheet 13. The striped sheet 10 and the homogeneous sheet 13 constituted a unit, and 50 units of these sheets were stacked in the Y direction. These sheets were then bonded by thermal compression at 80.degree. C. under a load in the range of 5 to 30 kgf/cm.sup.2. Thus, a biaxial stack 14 was produced. In this step, the striped sheets 10 and the homogeneous sheets 13 were stacked so that the fuel electrode material layers (first layers 11) of adjacent striped sheets 10 faced each other, that is, the fuel electrode material layers were arrayed in a line along the Y direction. Subsequently, the biaxial stack 14 was debinded at 600.degree. C. for 24 hours and then fired at 1,400.degree. C. for two hours. In this step, the temperature was increased at a rate of 100.degree. C./hr. After the firing, the removable material layers (second layers 12) became cavities. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 7, a ceramic structure 17 having a honeycomb structure and including through-holes 16 was produced. The openings of the through-holes 16 of the ceramic structure 17 were masked in a checkered pattern. The ceramic structure 17 was then dipped in a slurry containing YSZ used as a solid electrolyte material and then fired under the same conditions as those described above. Accordingly, a solid electrolyte layer having a thickness in the range of 5 to 20 .mu.m was formed on the inner walls of the through-holes 16 that were not masked. Subsequently, the ceramic structure 17 was fired at 1,400.degree. C. for two hours to fix the solid electrolyte layer. Subsequently, the ceramic structure 17 was dipped in a slurry containing LSM used as an air electrode material and then fired at 1,200.degree. C. for two hours. Accordingly, an air electrode layer having a thickness in the range of 5 to 10 .mu.m was formed on the solid electrolyte layer on the inner walls of the through-holes 16 that were not masked. The mask was then removed. Thus, an SOFC stack 40 having dimensions of 30 mm.times.30 mm.times.50 mm was obtained. Subsequently, the SOFC stack 40 was treated in a hydrogen reducing atmosphere at 800.degree. C. for five hours. Consequently, the fuel electrode layers were reduced to obtain a Ni-YSZ cermet structure.
