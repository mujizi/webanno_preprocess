[0062]Applying the nanoparticles can involve coating the nanoparticles dispersed in a solvent onto the flexible substrate and allowing the solvent to evaporate before overcoating the backfill layer. Applying the nanoparticles can also involve applying them in dry form to the flexible substrate and then overcoating them with the backfill layer. An alternative to the method involves using substrate with a release agent, in which the particles are applied to a substrate with a release agent, the substrate with the particles is applied to a device substrate with the particles in contact with it, and then the substrate is released to transfer the particles to the device substrate.
Replication Method
[0063]One solution for forming a master tool having nanostructures involves the use of interference lithography. Regular periodic features as small as 100 nm-150 nm can be quickly written using this method. An advantage involves being able to write these patterns over larger areas, which can make the process more amenable to manufacturing.
[0064]Production of a master tool for replication of the pattern can involve the following. A substrate is coated with an overlayer of photoresist and then illuminated with one or more UV interference patterns to expose the resist in a regular pattern with the desired feature sizes. Development of the resist then leaves an array of holes or posts. This pattern can subsequently be transferred into the underlying substrate through an etching process. If the substrate material is not suitable to be used as a replication tool, a metal tool can be made using standard electroforming processes. This metal replica would then become the master tool.
[0065]Another method involves forming a master tool having randomly-distributed nanostructures. A solution is prepared comprising nanoparticles of the appropriate size and with the appropriate surface modifications to prevent agglomeration. Methods for preparing such solutions are generally specific to the particular nanoparticles to be dispersed; general methods have been described elsewhere, including U.S. Pat. No. 6,936,100 and Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals, 444 (2006) 247-255, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The solution is then coated onto a flexible substrate using one of a variety of solvent coating techniques, including knife coating, dip coating, or spray coating. Pretreatment of the substrate using methods such as plasma etching may be required in order to assure uniformity of the solution coating. After solvent evaporation, the nanoparticles should be distributed in a way that is microscopically random but macroscopically uniform. As was the case with the uniform tool fabrication process described above, this pattern could then be transferred to an underlying substrate material through an etching or embossing process, or a metal tool can be made using standard electroforming processes.
