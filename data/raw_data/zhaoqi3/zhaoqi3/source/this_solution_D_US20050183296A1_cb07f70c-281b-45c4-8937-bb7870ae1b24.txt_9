[0070] Another object of this invention is that the said front opening (4) of the vaporiser (2) comprises a vertical tube (3a) the other end of which opens into an expansion chamber (1a) formed in the plate and for it to be closed below by a sheet (19) which is preferably made of stainless steel, and which covers the lower surface of the plate (1) as the element of contact with the garment to be ironed. This procedure is clearly illustrated in FIG. 7, especially in the enlarged details, where the situation of the gasket (16) can also readily be identified, and its position guarantees water-tightness between the vaporisation chamber (3) and the plate (1), against the circulating steam which, through the said expansion chamber (1a), ends up emerging via the holes (17) to the exterior of the plate (1) and its corresponding ones in the sheet (19), and that in respect of the present patent Number 200400197, it now becomes fully clarified. This variation to the vertical tube (3a) is also illustrated in FIG. 9.
[0071] By way of a variant to this, the invention also proposes a solution whereby the said front opening (4) of the vaporiser (2) is a vertical conduit (3b) which is closed at its other end, and is provided with lateral ports (3c) which communicate with an expansion chamber (1a) formed in the plate and which is closed below by a sheet (19) which is, preferably, made of stainless steel, and which covers the lower surface of the plate (1) as the element of contact with the garment to be ironed. This solution is clearly illustrated in FIG. 10.
[0072] Another feature that is an object of the present invention is that the interior of the vaporisation chamber (3) contains at least one partition wall (3d) which occupies the whole available height, and is attached to one of the side walls of the chamber but without extending to the opposite side wall. This solution is clearly illustrated in FIG. 8, where a preferred embodiment can be seen in which two of the said partition walls (3d) are provided, arranged in opposing directions and generating a wave pattern between the front part and the rear outlet (11) of the vaporisation chamber (3).
