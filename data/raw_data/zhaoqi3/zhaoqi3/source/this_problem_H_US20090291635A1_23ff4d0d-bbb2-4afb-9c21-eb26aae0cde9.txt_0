[0089] In order to receive data from the contactless card, circuit 62 comprises a differential amplifier 631, a correlation demodulator 632, a second data processing module 633 and a clock recovery module 634 used to recover the clock from the carrier of the fixed reader; these components are similar to those in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 5 and 6.
[0090] A device according to the invention equipped with such a circuit 62 can therefore operate if the contactless reader is a type A reader according to Standard ISO 14443 and uses a very high modulation index, such as 100% for example, in order to send commands. With this type of modulation with a 100% modulation index, there are periods during which the reader sends no signal. In fact, during such periods, neither the contactless card or the device according to the invention are remotely powered. In addition, because the reader does not send a signal, there is therefore no basis which can be used in order to establish communication between the device according to the invention and the contactless card.
[0091] In order to overcome this problem, circuit 62 described in relation to FIG. 7 recreates the signal during periods when the reader is silent. Second switch 643 is thus closed during the card's command phases. An adjustable gain is then applied to the signal produced by oscillator 637 and the signal, thus amplified, is subtracted from the antenna signal sampled by subtracter 642. When first switch 640 is open, the resulting signal has a constant amplitude and gaps in the reader's signal are filled regardless of their duration and amplitude.
[0092] Adjustment of the gain of first multiplier 638 is obtained by monitoring variations in the envelope of the signals on the antenna terminals thanks to gain adjustment module 644. This module 644 actually determines the variations in this envelope relative to its mean and the signal generated on the output of second subtracter 642 tends towards this mean.
[0093] Modulation of the control signal for the contactless card is also obtained by opening and closing first switch 640. Closing this switch actually causes a drop in the amplitude of the signal on the terminals of antenna 71 and this corresponds to the low modulation level.
