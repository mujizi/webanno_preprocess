#Text=[0219] Solution (12-b):
#Text=29 ion exchanged water 400 g silver sulfate (as silver) 1 g
#Text=[0220] After this solution (12-c) was left to stand for at least 24 hours, the solution was directly used as a solution (12-c') for providing a catalyst for electroless copper plating.
#Text=[0221] After an ABS resin sample subjected to pretreatments, i.e., etching and conditioning, in accordance with a conventional method was immersed in the solution (12-c') for 5 minutes, the sample was rinsed with water and then immersed in the solution (1-d) for 3 minutes.
