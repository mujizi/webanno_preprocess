The "count," or number of pills in the bottle, is determined by positioning the bottles in the pill dropping zone for a predetermined time. The duration of the filling operation for each bottle corresponds to the number of openings in each slat that the machine is capable of delivering to the bottles per unit of time. The duration of the filling operation, speed of the rotary slats, and configuration of the pill capturing device are used to calculate the count.
Unfortunately, if the pill capturing device fails to capture a pill in each and every cavity or receptacle, or if a pill should mistakenly be diverted, at least one of the bottles can be improperly filled. The conventional solution to this problem is to situate an operator adjacent to the slats to ensure that each receptacle is filled with a pill. If a pill is missing, the operator manually places a pill in the receptacle. Such an approach involves labor costs and can be unsatisfactory for sterility purposes. In addition, the accuracy of the count of each bottle is largely determined by the operator and, as such, a fully and consistently accurate count cannot be guaranteed.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,185,901 to Aylward, which is incorporated herein by reference, provides an exemplary solution to this problem by way of a machine with independently driven rotary slats. The pills are allowed to fall into an exterior receptacle of a rotary slat and, in one embodiment, passed under a rotary brush in an attempt to prevent two pills from being disposed in the same receptacle. A separate counting device is associated with each rotary slat for counting each pill as it falls from the slat into the container. A positive count is provided for each container and improperly filled slats will not affect the total count for that container. If a particular container has a low count, the respective slat can be further rotated to fill the container. Because the slats are independently driven, the other slats can remain stationary to prevent overfilling. Thus, the machine permits an accurate filling of each bottle.
One alternative apparatus is a rotatable drum, as provided in U.S. Pat. No. 4,094,439 to List. The rotatable drum includes a plurality of parallel rows of throughgoing holes that constitute receptacles for dragees. The dragees enter the receptacles in the drum from the interior of the drum at an inner input location, exit to the exterior of the drum at an outer retrieval location, and are filled into bottles. An ordering device facilitates the entry of the dragees into the receptacles, and feeler blades engage the receptacles. If any of the receptacles in an axially extending row do not contain a dragee, one of the feeler blades actuates a bolt pusher, which prevents any of the dragees in the row from being filled into the bottles. Instead, a solenoid and knockout bar empty the receptacles of the row. By preventing the bottles to be filled from partially filled rows of receptacles, the apparatus prevents the different bottles from being filled at different rates.
Undesirably, the additional mechanical components that are required for emptying the partially filled rows of apertures increase the complexity, cost, and likelihood of failure of the apparatus. Additionally, emptying the partially filled rows slows the process of filling the bottles because no pills are dispensed from those rows.
