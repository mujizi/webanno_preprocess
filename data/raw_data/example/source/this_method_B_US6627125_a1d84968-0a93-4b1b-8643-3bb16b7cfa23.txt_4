An optical substrate 1 according to this preferred embodiment thus has the functionality of both a color filter incorporating the color pattern layer 60, and a microlens array incorporating the lenses 34. As a result, a bright color display can be achieved.
It should be noted that if the second and third light transmitting layers 40 and 70 can provide the mechanical strength, gas barrier properties, chemical resistance, and other properties required for the optical substrate, the corresponding first and second reinforcing layers 50 and 80 can be removed. In this case the second and third light transmitting layers 40 and 70 become protective films for the first light transmitting layer 30. Moreover, if the light transmitting layer 30 itself has sufficient strength, the second and third light transmitting layers 40 and 70 can also be omitted.
As described above, color recesses 36 and lenses 34 can be easily formed by transfer to a light transmitting layer 30 according to the present invention. With this method there is highly efficient use of material, the number of production steps can be reduced, and cost reduction can be achieved.
Furthermore, once manufactured, the first and second masters 10 and 20 can be used repeatedly insofar as durability allows. The steps required to produce the masters 10 and 20 can therefore be eliminated from the production process for the second and subsequent optical substrates, thereby further reducing the number of production steps and helping to further reduce cost.
