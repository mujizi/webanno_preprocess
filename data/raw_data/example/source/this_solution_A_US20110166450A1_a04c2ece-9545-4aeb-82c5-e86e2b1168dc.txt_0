[0086] To avoid these checks, the subject matter of the invention according to one advantageous characteristic of embodiment, makes provision so that the means to determine the position of the displacing means 2-30a; 30b are part of the remote locating system 15. According to this advantageous variant of embodiment, the table 2 is equipped with a third marker 31 which is also visible by the two cameras 17. This third marker 31 comprises at least three, and in the illustrated example four reflective spheres 32 whose positions relative to one another are known. The locating system 15 therefore determines the spatial position of the table 2 within the same reference frame as the one associated with the first 21 and second 24 markers. The determination of the position of the table 2 and hence of the movement of the target t C allows tracking of the movement of the table 2 until the target C and the focal point F2 coincide.
[0087] Advantageously, this third marker 31 is oriented along three axes of movement of the table, namely axes OX, OY, OZ allowing calculation of the movement to be made within the reference frame X, Y, Z of the patient support, without having to calibrate the orientation of movements of the table 2 relative to the orientation of the third marker 31.
[0088] It is to be noted that this solution offers the advantage that the position of the cameras 17 may be any position and may vary from one locating procedure to another.
[0089] The locating system 15 transfers data to the apparatus 1 on the position of the displacing means 2-30a, 30b. The apparatus 1 is capable of recording the position of the displacing means and of displaying on the screen 8 the pathway taken by the displacing means, namely the pathway of the focal point F2 or the pathway of the target C, i.e. their position at each instant when being moved.
[0090] The apparatus 1 described above allows a novel and original method to be implemented for the locating and visualization of the target C.
