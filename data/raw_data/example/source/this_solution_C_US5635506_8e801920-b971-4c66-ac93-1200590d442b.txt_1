Alternatively, the compound can be prepared as follows:
B. A mixture of 210.3 mg of 10-acetamido-2-[2'-(dimethylamino)ethyl)ethyl]-1,2-dihydro-3H dibenz(deh) isoquinoline-1,3-dione, 50 ml of ethanol, and 5 ml of 37% HCl was heated under reflux for 2 hours and then concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in methanol and this solution was made alkaline with methanolic KOH. It was then concentrated to a residue that was purified by preparative TLC on silica gel with toluene-methanol (9:1) as solvent. This procedure gave 162 mg (76%) of the title compound as a brick-red solid that had a melting point of 143.degree.-145.degree. C. after crystallization from toluene.
