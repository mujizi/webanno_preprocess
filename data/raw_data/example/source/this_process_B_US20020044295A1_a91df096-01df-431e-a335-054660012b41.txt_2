[0060] As shown in FIG. 3, when the supply switch not shown in the attached drawings is turned on, the process of initializing the 1-chip microcomputer 28 itself, and each component of the printer device including the printing mechanism unit 40, etc. is first performed (step (hereinafter referred to simply as S) 301).
[0061] Then, the processes of selecting a memory card and displaying data for the initializing process are performed (S302 through S304). In this process, it is sequentially determined whether or not a memory card containing image data readable and displayable to each card slot has been inserted therein, displays the index after reading the image data readable and displayable from the memory card when such a memory card is inserted, and performs a process of lighting the LED 22 corresponding to the card slot into which the memory card has been inserted. The memory card for which an index has been displayed is set as a memory card selected in the initializing process. The processes in S302 through 304 are described later by referring to FIG. 4.
[0062] Then, normal memory card selecting and displaying processes are performed (S305 through S310). In this process, to determine whether or not a selected memory card has been changed, it is determined whether or not the memory card selection key 21 has been pressed (S305). In this determining process, if the memory card selection key 21 has been pressed (Y in S305), then it is further determined whether or not a memory card has been inserted into the card slot corresponding to the memory card selection key 21 (S306). If it has been inserted (Y in S306), then image data readable from the memory card is read and the index is displayed (S308), the memory card is set as a selected memory card, and control is passed to the subsequent process in S311. On the other hand, if no memory card has been inserted (N in S306), then an error process is performed by, for example, displaying a warning that no memory card has been inserted on the LCD monitor 6, etc. (S307), and control is passed to the process in S305.
[0063] On the other hand, if it is determined that the memory card selection key 21 has not been pressed in the determining process in S305 (N in S305), then it is determined whether or not the selected memory card bas been inserted (S309). If the selected memory card has not been inserted (N in S309), then control is returned to S305. If the selected memory card has been inserted (Y in S309), then it is further determined whether or not the memory card has been newly inserted, that is, whether or not the memory card has been preceded by no card (S310). If it is determined in this determining process that the memory card has been newly inserted (Y in S310), image data readable and displayable from the memory card is read, and an index is displayed (S308). If not (N in S310), then control is passed to the subsequent process in S311. The processes in S305 through S310 are described later by referring to FIG. 5.
[0064] The selected memory card is set as described above, and is then set in the memory card of a printing source, the memory card of a copying source.
