Example 67
2-ethyl-6-fluoro-4-trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0303]The compound of Example 46 (2.88 g) was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL). To this solution, triethylamine (4.51 mL) was added, followed by addition of anhydrous trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (2.97 mL) at 0.degree. C. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Subsequently, the reaction was terminated by adding water and the mixture was extracted three times with ethylacetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure and purification by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=20:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow oil (4.25).
