[0048] The transparent thermo-plastic resin, especially polyvinylchloride, co-polymer between vinylchloride and vinyl acetate, polymethylmethacrylate, nitrocellulose, chlorinated polyethylene, chlorinated polypropylene, and fluorovinylidene and the transparent hardening resin that is hardened by the application of heat, ultra-violet ray, electric beam or radioactive ray, especially melamine acrylate, urethane acrylate, epoxy resin, polyimid resin, and silicon resin such as acryl-transformer silicate are used as a binder. Therefore, the conductive layer 2, which is made of the transparent binder and the ultra fine conductive fiber, is a transparent layer. Also, inorganic material such as colloidal silica can be added to the binder. When the substrate 1 is made of a transparent thermo-plastic resin, the same transparent thermo-plastic resin or the different transparent thermo-plastic resin with the mutual-solubility is preferably used as the binder for acquiring the transparent conductive article. The article P with the durability against wearing can be obtained when the binder with a hardening resin or colloidal silica is used. Since the conductive layer 2 is formed on the surface of the substrate 1, adequate binder should be chosen to improve the particular property such as the durability against weathering, surface strength, and durability against wearing.
[0049] When the estimated content of the ultra fine conductive fiber 3 in the conductive layer 2 is 1.0-450 mg/m.sup.2, and when the thickness of the conductive layer 2 is reduced to 5-500 nm, the surface resistivity of 10.sup.0 to 10.sup.11.OMEGA./.quadrature. with the excellent conductivity, the anti-electrostatic property, and transparency is obtained, because the ultra fine conductive fibers 3 or the bundle of the fiber are dispersed so that each fiber or bundle is separated from other fibers or bundles. The preferable estimated content of the ultra fine conductive fiber 3 is 1.0 to 200 mg/m.sup.2 and the preferable thickness of the conductive layer 2 is 5 to 200 nm. The powdered conductive metal oxide of 30 to 50 weight % can be added beside the ultra fine conductive fiber to the conductive layer 2.
[0050] The conductive article P described above can be efficiently produced, for example, by the following methods. First, the binder for forming the conductive layer is solved into a volatile solvent. The ultra fine conductive fiber 3 is equally dispersed in this solution, making a coating solution, which is then applied to one surface of the substrate 1. The conductive layer 2 is obtained by drying the coating solution on the substrate 1, forming the conductive article P. In the second method, the coating solution is applied to the surface of the thermoplastic resin film, which is the same thermoplastic resin film as that the substrate 1 or the different thermo-plastic resin film with the mutual-solubility. Then, the coating solution is dried on the conductive film, forming the conductive film with the conductive layer 2. The conductive film is placed to one surface of the substrate 1 through thermal pressing or roll pressing, forming the conductive article P. In the third method, the coating solution is applied to and dried on a peeling-off film made of polyethyleneterephtalate, forming the conductive layer 2. Then, if necessary, an adhesive layer is formed on the conductive layer 2, forming a transfer film. The transfer film is pressed on one surface of the substrate 1, transferring the conductive layer 2 or the both adhesive layer and the conductive layer 2. The conductive article P is obtained. Also, the article of this invention can be produced by any conventional methods.
[0051] When the article P is formed through the first method, it is important to apply the thermal pressing at the final stage of the forming, because the thermal pressing can shrink the conductive layer 2 in the vertical direction. The frequency of contact between the ultra fine conductive fibers, which are dispersed in the conductive layer 2, increases and the space between the fibers is reduced, promoting the better flow of electricity, when the conductive layer 2 is pressed down in the vertical direction. This method has an effect to further reduce the surface resistivity. If the latter methods, the laminating method or transfer method is employed, the thermal pressing at the final stage of the production is not necessarily required, because the conductive layer has already been pressed down during the thermal pressing or the transferring process. Also, the final thermal pressing is not required if the desirable conductivity for the particular use of the conductive article has already been achieved before its application.
[0052] The following examples illustrate embodiments of the invention, but should not be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention.
