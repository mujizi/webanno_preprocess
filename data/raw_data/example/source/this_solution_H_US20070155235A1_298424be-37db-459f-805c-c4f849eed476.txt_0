[0007] Observed in prior art, on the other hand, is the fact that the strands are often compressed and deformed in a heterogeneous manner; that is, the compression is correct only in certain parts of the section of the cable.
[0008] In order to improve the electrical continuity and the resistance to traction in open crimp contacts, it has already been proposed to form indentations in the crimp barrel. Reference may be made, for example, to U.S. Pat. No. 5,901,439 on this subject.
[0009] However, when it is applied to open crimpings, this solution has been found to be unsatisfactory due to the fact that the indentations could "injure" the core of the cable by cutting some of the conducting strands.
[0010] For closed-barrel contacts, one possibility of improvement consists in increasing the necking. However, this possibility is limited, because, above a certain value and with the methods used at present, there is quite substantial formation of fins in the junctions between the parts of the tool used.
[0011] The objective of the invention is to remedy these drawbacks and to propose a crimping that, for the closed-barrel contacts of the above-mentioned type, ensures an optimal contact between the strands of the cable on the one hand and between the cable and the contact on the other hand. The objective of the invention is also to ensure the stability of the electrical connection at the end of the necking operation and throughout the life of the electrical connection.
