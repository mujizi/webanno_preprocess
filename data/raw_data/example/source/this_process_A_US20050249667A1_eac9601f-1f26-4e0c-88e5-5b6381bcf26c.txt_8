[0885] In one embodiment, the inorganic microtubules are metallized.
[0886] FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of a preferred process 410 for preparing specified organic assemblies, and FIG. 8 is a schematic of a portion of such process 410. For the sake of illustration and not limitation, FIG. 7 describes the preparation of a tubulin assembly with a specified polarity and charge density. It will be apparent, however, that the process of FIG. 7 (and FIGS. 8A and 8B) may readily be used to prepare other biological assemblies with other specified properties.
[0887] Referring to FIG. 7, and in step p 412 of this process, and in one preferred embodiment, the polarity and charge density of various alpha and beta tubulins is determined. Some or all of these alpha- and beta-tubulins may thereafter be used, as desired, as a reagent in the process depicted n FIGS. 8A and 8B by adding and/or removing sauch alpha-and/or beta-tubulins from the reaction mixture 428 at specified times and/or by purifying and/or modifying such alpha- and/or beta-tubulins and thereafter using them in the reaction process.
[0888] As is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,750,330, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification, many different forms of tubulin and its monomeric precursors have been isolated. At lines 42 et seq. of column 1 of this patent, it is disclosed that "Different forms of tubulin have been isolated. These include a microtubule associated protein (MAP)-rich tubulin that is 50% to 97% purified (Shelanski, M. L., Gaskin, F., and C. R. Cantor, 1973, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 70, 765-768), highly purified (97% to 99.99% or apparently 100% purified by silver stain or coomassie-blue stained SDS-PAGE) tubulin, e.g., Phospho-cellulose purified tubulin (Lee, J. C., Tweedy, N., S. N. Timasheff, 1978, Biochemistry, 17(14), 2783-2790), tubulin from crude cancer cell line extracts (Weatherbee, J. A., Luftig, R. B., R. R. Weihing, 1980, Biochemistry, 19 (17), 4116-4123), tubulin isolated from higher eukaryotes and their cell lines (Weatherbee et al. 1980), tubulin isolated from fungi and yeasts and their cell lines (Davis, A., Sage, C. R., Dougherty, C., K. W. Farrell, 1993, Biochemistry, 32, 8823-8835), tubulin isolated from parasitic organisms or their cell lines (Dawson, P. J., Gutteridge, W. E., K. Gull, 1983, Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology, 7(3), 267-277), and tubulins isolated from recombinant systems and recombinant organisms (Davis, A., Sage, C. R., Dougherty, C., K. W. Farrell, 1994, Science, 264, 839-842.) Some or all of these "many forms of tubulin and its monomeric precursors" may be used in the processes of FIGS. 7, 8A, and/or 8B.
[0889] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,750,330, "Tubulin is an essential intracellular protein that is necessary for mitosis, transport of intracellular material, cell structure, and cell motility. Tubulin is composed of a heterodimer of two closely related 55 Kilodalton proteins called alpha and beta tubulin. These two proteins are encoded by separate genes or small gene families, whose sequences are highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom."
