[0007] Devices and methods for cleaning dirt according to the type mentioned at the outset are known in practice. Here, reference is made to DE 43 35 117 C2 as an example. In methods of prior art, first a chemical binder and fresh water are applied on the soiled area. The binder-water compound is then rubbed into the surface with brushes, and then it is supplied via a suctioning device to a waste water tank. This cleaning method is called wet scrubbing.
[0008] From prior art, additionally pressure washing machines are known, which apply a concentrated water-cleaning solution on the soiled surface under high pressure, in order to release the dirt this way. Then, the waste water is suctioned off the area via a suction device.
[0009] The wet scrubbing method is disadvantageous in that in practice usually several processing steps are required to reach a satisfactory cleaning result. The high consumption of concentrated cleaning solution is also disadvantageous, which leads to extreme environmental contamination. When cleaning areas via pressure washing, it is problematic that this method needs large amounts of water. This leads to high disposal costs for the developing waste water and a short range of operation for the cleaning vehicles. In this method it is additionally disadvantageous that by the high water pressure the surface to be cleaned may be damaged.
BRIEF SUMMARY
[0010] The present invention is therefore based on the objective to provide a device and a method for removing soiling of the type mentioned at the outset equipped and further developed such that with a small amount of cleaning liquid the removal of soiling is possible while using small amounts of cleaning solution and a gentle treatment of the surface, with as little energy as possible being consumed.
