In step 2, an urea/thiourea compound 16 is prepared by reacting a compound 15 with an isocyanate/isothiourea in a organic solvent including dichloromethane, dicloroethane, or tetrahydrofuran.
In step 3, a compound of formula Ie is prepared by removing the amino-protecting group from compound 16 under hydrogenation conditions using a catalyst such as palladium or platinum catalysts. Suitable solvents for the reaction include protic or aprotic organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and the like.
An exemplary preparation of a compound of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compound of formula Ie is described in detail in Example 10.
Scheme F
Scheme F describes an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 is group represented by formula (A), and R.sup.3 is --(CH.sub.2).sub.m SO.sub.2 NR.sup.6 R.sup.9 from the termediate compounds of formula If. ##STR14##
