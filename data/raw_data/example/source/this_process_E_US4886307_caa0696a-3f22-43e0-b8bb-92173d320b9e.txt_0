In FIG. 14 the hinged part 47 is open. The pull lever 89 which is acted on by the force accumulator has its stop 88 resting against the locking shoulder 87 of the release member 85. The fork mouth 81 then extends into the entrance slot 97 for the eye-shaped mating closure part 98. Furthermore the hook end 64 of the locking member 65 blocks the charging lever 58 which represents an abutment for the force accumulator K. The gas pressure spring 52 holds the hinged part 47 in the swung-open position in which the pin 57 lies against one end of the slot 56 of the swing lever 55. Furthermore, in this position the swing lever 55 extends close to a dead-center line, exceeded by it, which passes through the pin 50.
Upon the closing of the hinged part 47, the mating closure part 98 acts on the fork latch 80 in the region of the fork-mouth opening 81; see FIG. 15. Upon further entrance of the mating closure part 98 into the entrance slot 97, the fork latch 80 is moved into the position shown in FIG. 16. The locking tooth 76 of the locking pawl 74 comes into the pre-detent recess 77 of the fork latch. At the same time, the one arm 85' of the release member 85 is acted on via the transverse pin of the fork-latch tail 82. In this way, the locking shoulder 87 of the other arm 85" changes its position with respect to the stop 88 of the pull lever 89, so that upon further displacement of the hood 47 in the closing direction of the pre-detent position, the release of the pull lever takes place with time delay and the force accumulator K can then discharge. Since the cylinder end thereof is blocked by the locking member 65, the discharge can take place only by swinging of the pull lever 89, the pressure shoulder 92 of which acts on the control surface 93 of the fork latch 80 and swings the latter in clockwise direction, further pulling the mating closure part 98 into the closed position shown in FIG. 17. The locking-pawl/locking tooth 76 can then engage into the main detent recess 78 and secure the fork latch 80 against turning backward. In this position the blocking engagement between locking member 65 and charging lever 58 is maintained. Furthermore, the pin 57 extends on the middle portion of the slot 56 of the swing lever. The pull lever 89 is under the action of the tensioned tension spring 95.
For the opening of the lock, the connecting rod 69 must be shifted by the trip eye 68 in the direction indicated by the arrow x into the position shown in FIG. 18. Simultaneously with this, the locking member (blocking member) 65 swings and its hook end 64 releases the charging lever 58. At the same time, the locking pawl 74 is swung in counterclockwise direction via the transmission rod 71, after elimination of the free motion (free path) between coupling pin 73 and slot 72, in such a manner that its locking tooth 76 leaves the main detent recess 78 of the fork latch 78. During this process, the pull lever 89 is swung via the tension spring 95. The discharging force accumulator K thereby displaces the charging lever 58 in clockwise direction, its pin 57 coming into the region of the lower end of the slot 56 of the swing lever 55. The free motion between charging lever 58 and swing lever 55 is thus eliminated. The fork latch 80 is also turned via the tension spring 84. The transverse pin 83 of the fork-latch tail 82 moves away from the release member 85 and permits the latter also to effect a spring-biased swinging in clockwise direction. In this way, the locking shoulder 87 passes in front of the stop 88 of the pull lever 89. With the release of the mating closure part 98, the gas pressure spring 52 has also swung the hinged part 47 slightly into an open-slit position. Upon the further opening of the hinged part 47, the charging lever 58 is immediately swung by the pin 57 present at the end in the slot 56, in which connection the charging of the force accumulator takes place since the piston-rod end cannot move away due to the blocked position of the pull lever. During the opening displacement of the hinged part, the rounded edge 99 on the end of the charging lever arm 58" acts on the facing latch rounding 100 of the locking member 65 and swings it in opposition to its spring charge into the dot-dash position shown in FIG. 14 so that the hook end 64 can engage behind the tooth 63 of the charging lever and thus block the latter, while preventing an unintended discharging of the force accumulator K.
The force accumulator springs 62 and 52 are so adapted to each other that the hinged part 47 remains approximately in balanced condition in the position in which it is.
A reversal is also conceivable in the manner that the mating closure part is associated with the vehicle chassis and the fork latch is associated with the other lock parts of the hood.
