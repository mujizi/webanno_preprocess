In operation of the gas turbine engine 10, in the event that a fan blade 34, or a portion of a fan blade 34, becomes detached it pierces the thin metallic casing 52, before it encounters the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54, 56,56', 58 and 60. The thin corrugated metallic sheets 54, 56,56', 58 and 60 are impacted by the fan blade 34, or portion of the fan blade 34, and effectively remove energy from the fan blade 34, or portion of the fan blade 34.
Each of the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54, 56,56', 58 and 60 has relatively low mass and hence low inertia. This allows the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54, 56,56', 58 and 60 to move with the detached fan blade 34, or portion of the fan blade 34. This movement spreads the impact energy over a larger area of the fan blade containment assembly 38 enabling the use of a lower mass of material to contain the detached fan blade 34, or portion of the fan blade 34.
The detached fan blade 34, or portion of the fan blade 34, causes the corrugations 62 in the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54, 56,56', 58 and 60 to be straightened out and this process absorbs energy from the detached fan blade 34 or portion of the fan blade 34. As the corrugations 62 are straightened out sequentially in the adjacent thin corrugated metallic sheets 54, 56,56', 58 and 60, the adjacent thin metallic sheets 54, 56,56', 58 and 60 slide over each other and absorb more energy from the fan blade 34 by friction between the adjacent thin corrugated metallic sheets 54, 56,56', 58 and 60. As the corrugations 62 are straightened out the welds-between the corrugations 62 on adjacent thin corrugated metallic sheets 54, 56,56', 58 and 60 are broken, this also absorbs more energy. As each thin corrugated metallic sheet 54, 56,56', 58 and 60 is straightens over the impact region it stiffens locally and transfers load to material further from the impact region, this increases the proportion of the fan blade containment assembly 38 contributing to energy absorption.
The fan blade containment assembly 38C, as shown more clearly in FIGS. 15 and 20, comprises a relatively thin metallic cylindrical, or frustoconical, casing 52 and a plurality of, two in this example, relatively thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56'. The thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56' are wound together into spirals around the casing 52 and the circumferential ends of the thin corrugated metallic sheet 54 and 56,56' are joined to the casing 52 by for example welding, brazing, nuts and bolts or other mechanical fasteners. The thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56' are wound around the thin metallic casing 52 more than once, preferably a number of times. The axial ends of the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56' are joined to each other and the casing 52 by welding or other suitable means or retained by band clamps. The axial ends of the casing 52 are provided with the flanges 40 and 42. The thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56' are arranged to abut each other at circumferentially and axially spaced locations where the corrugations 62 contact. The thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56' are spot welded, or seam welded, together at the spaced locations where the corrugations 62 contact to improve the rigidity or integrity of the fan blade containment assembly 38. The corrugations 62 of the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56' are shown more clearly in FIGS. 17, 18, 19 and 20.
In some circumstances the welds between the corrugations 62 of the thin corrugated metallic sheets may not be required.
