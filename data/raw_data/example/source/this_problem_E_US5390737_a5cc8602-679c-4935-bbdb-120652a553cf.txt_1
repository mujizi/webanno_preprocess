DRILLING OUT THE PACKER APPARATUS
Drilling out any embodiment of downhole tool 10 may be carried out by using a standard drill bit at the end of tubing string 16. Cable tool drilling may also be used. With a standard "tri-cone" drill bit, the drilling operation is similar to that of the prior art except that variations in rotary speed and bit weight are not critical because the non-metallic materials are considerably softer than prior art cast iron, thus making tool 10 much easier to drill out. This greatly simplifies the drilling operation and reduces the cost and time thereof.
Fifth embodiment packer 412 has an advantage over the other embodiments in that sliding valve 474 therein is above the packer elements and slips. Thus, when packer 412 is drilled out, sliding valve 474 is drilled first, thus relieving pressure from below the valve before the slips and packer element are drilled. With the first, second, third and fourth embodiments, the upper slips and packer elements are drilled before the valve, and thus before any pressure is relieved. In some cases, this can result in the lower end of the packer being forced upwardly by the pressure once the restraint of the upper slips is removed. It is possible that this can cause jamming of the drill bit or lifting of the tool string. Fifth embodiment packer 412 avoids this problem.
In addition to standard tri-cone drill bits, and particularly if tool 10 is constructed utilizing engineering grade plastics for the mandrel as well as for slip wedges, slips, slip supports and housings, alternate types of drill bits may be used which would be impossible for tools constructed substantially of cast iron. For example, polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits may be used. Drill bit 14 in FIG. 1 is illustrated as a PDC bit. Such drill bits have the advantage of having no moving parts which can jam up. Also, if the well bore itself was drilled with a PDC bit, it is not necessary to replace it with another or different type bit in order to drill out tool 10.
While specific squeeze packer configurations of the downhole tool have been described herein, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that other tools may also be constructed utilizing components selected of non-metallic materials, such as engineering grade plastics.
