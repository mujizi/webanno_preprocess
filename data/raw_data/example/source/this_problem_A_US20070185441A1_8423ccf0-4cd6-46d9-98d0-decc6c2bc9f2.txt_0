[0004] 2. Description of the Related Art
[0005] Subcutaneous injection is a standard method for the delivery of medication into a patient's body. To facilitate frequent or continuous subcutaneous injection of medication, subcutaneous injection ports are often used. Such injection ports extend through the skin and may remain in place for several days. Currently, a major application of such injection ports is to provide continuous delivery of medication, such as insulin, from portable pumps carried with the patient. When used with a portable pump, the injection port is typically connected to the pump via a fluid line. Another application of subcutaneous injection ports is to permit multiple injections of medication into a patient without the need to re-puncture the patient's skin. In this application, medication is injected from a standard medical implement, such as a syringe, through a soft elastomer septum into the injection port which delivers the medication subcutaneously.
[0006] Subcutaneous injection ports generally require a sharp, rigid needle to pierce the patient's skin when initially attached to the patient. However, in some applications, if the needle were left in place through the skin to provide medication delivery, after one or two days the needle could become uncomfortable to the patient. To solve this problem, infusion sets with removable needles and soft plastic cannula to be placed inside the body of a patient have been developed. However, these sets have many disadvantages. There remains a need for an improved infusion set that is less bulky, less susceptible to contamination, more comfortable to a user, and easier to use.
[0007] Some embodiments of the present invention provide an infusion set comprising a base member, an introducer cap, and an infusion cap. The base member preferably comprises a port on a first side thereof, and a soft cannula extending from a second side of the base member. The port is configured to be in fluid communication with the cannula. The port also comprises a septum adapted to seal the port against unwanted fluid flow. The introducer cap is adapted to be mounted to the base member and has a needle adapted to extend through the septum and said soft cannula in an assembled position. Other embodiments can use a rigid cannula of various materials. The infusion cap comprises a lumen adapted to receive an elongate flexible tube. The infusion cap also comprises a hard cannula adapted to be inserted through the septum and to place said soft cannula in fluid communication with said lumen.
[0008] The base member is preferably circular, and the port preferably comprises a cylindrical portion extending from a first side of the base member. The introducer cap preferably comprises a hollow cylindrical portion extending from the second side of the introducer cap and located coaxially with the introducer needle. The infusion cap preferably comprises a hollow cylindrical portion extending from the second side of the infusion cap and located coaxially with the hard cannula. The first side of the infusion cap preferably is dome-shaped, and the infusion cap is preferably adapted to be rotatable relative to the base member when the infusion cap and the base member are assembled.
