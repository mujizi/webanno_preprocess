[0069] Table IX shows fuel properties of sample diesels produced by Example 2. The NOISE analysis of the diesel fraction indicates that it is mainly composed of paraffins, iso-paraffins, and naphthenes, as shown in Table IX. The amount of naphthenes in hydrocondensation diesel is twice the amount in ULSD, the amount of paraffins is 1/5, and aromatics are 1/10 of the amount in ULSD. This unique product distribution resulted in excellent cold flow properties compared to ULSD. The cloud point and pour point of the distillate fraction were -66 and -70.degree. F. indicating that this biomass based diesel fuel may be used at or below 60.degree. F. The cetane number of the hydrodeoxygenation-diesel measured through a blended IQT test is .about.58, superior to conventional ULSD. Other properties such as density, API gravity, lubricity, heat of combustion, and total acid number (TAN) are similar to that of ULSD. The distillation profile (T10, T50, and T90 points) also resembles that of ULSD. Furthermore, the amount of sulfur is <1 ppm. This superior quality on-spec diesel can be directly blended into the existing ULSD pool as a drop in fuel. The measured flash, pour and cloud point of distillate fraction are superior to that of ULSD.
