It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple preparation method for silver and silver alloyed nanoparticles having a well-controlled size in a surfactant solution. It is a further objective of this invention to provide an economic and simple preparation method for silver alloyed with other inorganic elements such as Pt, Pd, Au, Al or S to modify the physico-chemical properties of silver nanoparticles in a surfactant solution.
The procedure for the formation of size-controlled silver nanoparticles in surfactant solutions can be described as follows: (step 1) prepare an aqueous silver salt solution such as silver nitrate, silver acetate or other water soluble silver salts, (step 2) prepare an aqueous solution of a reducing agent of silver ions and surfactant, and (step 3) adding the solution prepared in step 2 into the solution prepared in step 1, or vice versa to form a silver colloid.
For the formation of alloyed silver nanoparticles, a mixed water-soluble salts solution of silver and water-soluble salt is prepared, which can bring together the wanted ions in the same manner as in the above-mentioned step 1. Metals such as palladium nitrate for Ag--Pd alloyed nanoparticles, HAuCl.sub.4 for Ag--Au alloyed nanoparticles, and so can be used. For example, the alloyed nanoparticles of silver and palladium can be prepared by mixing a mixed salt solution of silver nitrate and palladium nitrate and adding the aqueous solution of the reducing agent and the surfactant into this solution. Nanoparticles of Ag/Pd alloy are then obtained. In this case, the physico-chemical properties of the particles would be different from those of silver and palladium nanoparticles. The size of the alloyed nanoparticles depends on the kind and/or concentration of surfactant used, similar to the procedure used in the formation of silver nanoparticles.
For the formation of Ag/Au alloyed nanoparticles, silver nitrate and HAuCl.sub.4 are dissolved in water at a desired ratio. The aqueous solution of reducing agent such as hydrazine, ethylene glycol, ethylene oxide based chemicals, NaBH.sub.4, LiBH.sub.4, or LiAlH.sub.4 and surfactant are added into a mixed salt solution while stirring. Thus, an alloyed Ag/Au nanoparticles can be obtained.
The size of the nanoparticles can be adjusted by changing the type of the surfactant or the concentration of the surfactant in an aqueous solution. For the silver and alloyed silver nanoparticles, anionic and nonionic surfactants produced fine particles, but the cationic surfactant was not as efficient as anionic or nonionic surfactants possibly due to the positive surface charge of silver particles in aqueous solution.
