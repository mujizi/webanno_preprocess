[0056] A buffer 39 sequentially stores the print data stored in the D-RAM 38 for each piece of line data corresponding to a thermal head 41 of a printing mechanism unit 40. The stored line data is sequentially transmitted to the printing mechanism unit 40.
[0057] The printing mechanism unit 40 performs a printing process by sublimating and adsorbing the dyestuff of the ink film (ink ribbon) on paper by driving the thermal head 41 based on the line data sequentially output from the buffer 39. At this time, the paper is moved forward and backward along the longer side of the paper by a feed roller (not shown in the attached drawings), etc. in response to the sequential application of each color ink film of Y (yellow), M (magenta), and C (cyan), thereby realizing an overlapping printing process using three color ink films.
[0058] Described below in detail is the control process by the 1-chip microcomputer 28 of the printer device with the above mentioned configuration. This process is performed by the 1-chip microcomputer 28 executing the control program stored therein.
[0059] FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example of a control process performed when the supply switch of the printer device is turned on.
[0060] As shown in FIG. 3, when the supply switch not shown in the attached drawings is turned on, the process of initializing the 1-chip microcomputer 28 itself, and each component of the printer device including the printing mechanism unit 40, etc. is first performed (step (hereinafter referred to simply as S) 301).
