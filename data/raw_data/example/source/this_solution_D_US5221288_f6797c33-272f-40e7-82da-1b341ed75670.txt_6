Next, to a 10-l vat, 6000 parts of water, 2.7 parts of SUNFIX 70 (trade name, dicyanamide type cationic polymer compound, product of Sanyo Kasei Co., Ltd.) and 15 parts of ethylene glycol were added, and the trainer described above was immersed in this solution and treated at 60.degree. C. for 15 minutes and then thoroughly rinsed and dehydrated.
Next, 6000 parts of water were added to this vat, and 45 parts of the thermochromic microcapsules of Preparation example 3 were added and dispersed.
This dispersion was gradually heated to 70.degree. C., at which temperature it was treated for 15 minutes, after which it was thoroughly rinsed and dehydrated. Then, 6000 parts of water were added and 30 parts (solid content=about 9 parts) of HYDRIN AP-20 (trade name, polyurethane resin emulsion, product of Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, Inc.) were added, and this solution was gradually heated to 70.degree. C., at which temperature it was treated for 15 minutes, after which it was dehydrated and allowed to dry.
This trainer was found to be dark yellow at temperatures below about 25.degree. C., but it became white at about 30.degree. C. This change could be reversibly repeated in cycles. In addition, the appearance, handling touch, color fastness to rubbing and color fastness to washing of the trainer were all good.
