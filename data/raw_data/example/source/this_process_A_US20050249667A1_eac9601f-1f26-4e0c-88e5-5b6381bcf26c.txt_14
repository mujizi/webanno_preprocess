[1214] Referring again to FIGS. 43 and 44, in one embodiment, a microtubule, intermediate filament, or actin fiber of the diseased cells in the organ 7020 are treated with sonic energy at a frequency between about 100 kilohertz and about 100 megahertz, more preferably from about 1 megahertz to about 100 megahertz, and more preferably from about 10 megahertz and about 100 megahertz. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, the applicants believe these filaments and microtubules are a part of the cell division apparatus of a dividing cell called the mitotic spindle and disrupt this spindle or its connections with cellular components such as chromosomes or centrosomes, resulting in cell damage or death. In one preferred embodiment, microtubules are vibrated until they become disconnected from the kinetechore of the metaphase chromosome or the polar bodies via one or more of the processes of this invention.
[1215] A process for determining the effect of a sonic energy regimen on cells may be carried out by methods described elsewhere in this specification. Alternatively, the effect may be determined by any conventional method. Methods that describe the characterization of the assembly and disassembly of microtubules are well known to those skilled in the art. Reference may be had, e.g., to U.S. Pat. No. 6,740,751 (Methods and compositions for stabilizing microtubules and intermediate filaments in striated muscle cells), U.S. Pat. No. 6,699,969 (Assays for the detection of microtubule depolymerization inhibitors), U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,687 (Polypeptides for the detection of microtubule depolymerization inhibitors), and U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,206 (Process for the formation of high aspect ratio lipid microtubules). The entire disclosures of said patents are incorporated by reference into this specification.
[1216] Alternatively, one may use the process 5000 described in FIG. 45. In this embodiment, one can perform step 5010 by combining tubulin monomers with a radioactively labeled guanosine tri-phosphate (GTP). As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the gamma phosphate is the third phosphate group attached to the GTP molecule and is the moiety that is cleaved during GTP hydrolysis during microtubule disassembly. Placement of the radioactive label in the gamma position allows for the monitoring of radioactivity of the radioactive phosphate group once it is separate from the GTP molecule following GDP hydrolysis thus resulting in the polymerization of microtubules that contain the labeled GTP. Radioactive phosphate gamma-labeled GTP is easily obtained from Perkin Elmer Life And Analytical Sciences, Inc. 549 Albany Street, Boston, Mass. 02118-2512. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 6,872,537 (Assays for the detection of microtubule depolymerization inhibitors), which teaches this process: "Microtubules can be purified to homogeneity by a single taxol-induced microtubule polymerization step in ib supplemented with 1 mm gtp as described previously (bokros et al. (1993), biochemistry 32(13): 3437-47). Briefly, samples of deae-isolated tubulin are thawed and resuspended in ib supplemented with 1 mm dtt and 1 mm gtp, and clarified by centrifugation for 1 hr at 100,000.times.g (2.degree. c.) In a beckman tl-100 ultracentrifuge (tla-100 rotor). Clarified tubulin is polymerized with a two fold molar excess of taxol in a microtubule assembly buffer composed of ib, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm gtp and 1% dmso. Assembly of microtubules was performed by gradual temperature ramping from 2.degree. c. To 25.degree. c. Over a 2-hour period." The entire disclosure of this United States patent is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification.
[1217] Referring again to FIG. 45, step 5020 comprises washing assembled microtubules with phosphate buffered saline. Step 5030 comprises centrifugation in which the microtubules are separated from the unpolymerized components of the mixture. In one embodiment, one centrifuges in accordance with the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,872,537: "Polymer is collected by centrifugation for 45 min at 30,000.times.g at 25.degree. C., through a cushion of 20% (w/v) sucrose in assembly buffer." It is the object of this step 5020 to obtain pellets with the polymerized microtubules.
[1218] Referring again to FIG. 45, step 5040 comprises insonifying the sample according to the technique described elsewhere in this disclosure. Step 5050 comprises repeating the steps of step 5030 centrifugation and 5040 insonification. Step 5060 comprises measuring the radioactivity in the supernatant of the sample recovered in step 5050 by any conventional method. Alternatively, in one embodiment, one can measure radioactivity using a scintillation counter. One may use any of the commercially available instruments. Examples of typical instruments used in this embodiment are a Beckman-Coulter LS 6500 Scintillation (obtained from Beckman Coulter, Inc., 4300 N. Harbor Boulevard, P.O. Box 3100, Fullerton, Calif. 92834-3100) or a Packard Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation Counter (obtained from Global Medical Instrumentation, Inc., 6511 Bunker Lake Boulevard, Ramsey, Minn. 55303). It is the object of this step to determine how much of the p32 radioactively labeled phosphate was cleaved from the GTP during hydrolysis.
