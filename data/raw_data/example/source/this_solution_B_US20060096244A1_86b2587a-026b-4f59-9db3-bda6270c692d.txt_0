[0011] a second sealer and cutter assembly similar to the first assembly, and independent of it, mounted close to the base of the portal frame and mobile in synchrony with the first assembly by means of two additional arms, designed to seal and cut the second band in the same way as the first.
[0012] This type of solution consists basically of a machine already well known in the trade used to apply a single band, with the simple addition of another pair of film rolls and a second, fixed, independent unit but without adapting its constructional philosophy to suit the new requirement.
[0013] This type of structure has several disadvantages which have been overcome in a new solution proposed by the same Applicant as the present (see Italian patent application BO2002 A000232), in which the two sealing and cutting units are supported by a single mounting unit that projects from the portal frame and that slides along the frame crossbeam to and from the idle and working positions of the units: this solution has made the sealing and cutting units extremely, practical and adaptable to any type of production line in which the portal frame is used.
[0014] This improvement has led to a widespread and increased use of labels applied to the plastic bands and bearing information such as product type, destination, origin, quantity, weight, etc.
[0015] The labels, usually placed on three sides of the palletized load, are applied to the plastic band at a station located downstream of the banding machine and equipped with independent label application means.
