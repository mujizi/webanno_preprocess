[0073] The model 6' and the sleeve 6 are then simultaneously placed into rotation at the same angular velocity around their respective axes X and X' and in a direction of rotation which makes it possible to unwind the belt 5 from the model 6' and to wind it simultaneously around the sleeve 6.
[0074] FIG. 7 shows the case where the direction of the rotation of the model 6' and of the sleeve 6 are the same and where the portion of the belt 5 connecting the model 6' to the sleeve 6 does not cross through the plane passing through the axes X and X', in which case the directions of winding of the belt 5 onto the model 6' and of the sleeve 6 are the same.
[0075] It is nevertheless possible to rotate the model 6' and the sleeve 6 in the opposite direction in relation to one another by passing the portion of the belt 5 connecting the model 6' to the sleeve 6 through the plane passing through the axes X and X', in which case the directions of winding of the belt 5 onto the model 6' and of the sleeve 6 are inversed in relation to one another, this solution having the advantage of making it possible to shorten as much as possible the length of the intermediary section formed by the belt that is already unwound from the model 6' and not yet wound onto the sleeve 6.
[0076] Regardless of the solution adopted, the state of elongation of the belt 5 on the sleeve 6, for each one of the coils of this belt, is then such that, during future inflation of the jacket 2 of this sleeve, the maximum diameter that this jacket can reach on this coil will be equal to the diameter of the model 6' at this same point, inasmuch as the geometry of the jacket 2 of the sleeve 6 at its maximum inflation will be identical to that of the model 6'.
[0077] Alternatively to this method, it is possible to manufacture, by knitting or weaving, a retaining sheath 3 intended to cover the jacket 2 and having the same properties as the bandage accomplished by winding the belt 5.
