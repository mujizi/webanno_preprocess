[0090] According to a preferred embodiment, the outer layer Ce comprises 4 to 10 wires (N=4-10), in other words the cord of the invention is chosen from the group of cords with 1+4, 1+5, 1+6, 1+7, 1+8, 1+9 and 1+10 constructions. According to a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the cord selected has a 1+5, 1+6 or 1+7 construction.
[0091] The cord according to the invention may be manufactured using various techniques, for example: [0092]firstly by sheathing, via an extrusion head, a core thread with the sheathing rubber in the uncured state, followed by [0093]a final cabling or stranding operation, in line with the previous operation, of the N wires of the layer Ce around the layer Ci, during which operation the N wires will transiently bear on the uncured sheathing rubber.
[0094] A person skilled in the art might expect that the sheathing rubber in the uncured state, and at a relatively high temperature, and consequently having a low viscosity, would migrate between the N wires of the outer layer before they have time to be correctly positioned. Surprisingly, nothing of the sort takes place--the viscoelasticity of the diene elastomer composition seems a posteriori to be well suited to avoiding this problem.
[0095] Preferably, the above final operation of positioning the outer layer Ce is carried out by a twisting operation, for example using a twister with a rotating feed or reception, said process substantially comprising the following steps: [0096]the wires of said outer layer Ce are wound in a helix with a given transient twist pitch on said inner layer Ci; then [0097]an overtwist is applied so as to reduce this transient pitch, that is to say to increase the helix angle of said outer layer Ce and, consequently, the helix curvature of the latter; and then [0098]the cord obtained is stabilized by untwisting it so as to obtain a zero residual torque.
[0099] Such a twisting process gives each wire of the outer layer Ce an excessively large curvature which moves it away, upon untwisting, from the inner layer Ci and from the sheathing rubber. This curvature is defined on the one hand by the helix diameter of this outer layer and, on the other hand, by the helix pitch p.sub.2 (or else the helix angle) of said outer layer Ce.
