[0009] In the cooling tower constituted as described above, if the sprinkler 4 sprays a cooling fluid as the atmospheric air passes through the evaporative cooling section 3, the cooling fluid is evaporatively cooled as it passes through the evaporative cooling section 3.
[0010] The cooling fluid, which has been evaporatively cooled by the above process, circulates in the apparatus to be cooled. This process is repeated.
[0011] According to the conventional cooling tower of the prior art, atmospheric air introduced into an inlet 6 passes through the evaporative cooling section 3 and moves toward the ventilating fan 5. During this process, contact of the induced air with a cooling fluid injected by the sprinkler 4 causes the evaporation of the cooling fluid, so that the cooling fluid can be evaporatively cooled.
[0012] The corresponding changes in the temperature of the air and the cooling fluid are depicted in FIG. 9B. As shown in FIG. 9B, the inflow air induced from the atmosphere is introduced into the evaporative cooling section with the wet-bulb temperature Twbi1, evaporatively cools the cooling fluid and then is discharged with the outlet wet-bulb temperature Twbo increased higher than the inlet wet-bulb temperature Twbi1. Thereby, the cooling fluid is cooled from the inlet cooling fluid temperature Tfi to the outlet cooling fluid temperature Tfo. In this cooling procedure, the evaporative cooling temperature of the cooling fluid is limited to the wet-bulb temperature Twbi of the induced atmospheric air.
[0013] Since the wet-bulb temperature of the atmosphere can not be controlled arbitrarily, the heat and mass transfer between the air and the cooling fluid are devised to be improved in the prior arts for a better performance of the cooling tower so that the outlet temperature of the cooling fluid comes closer to the atmospheric wet-bulb temperature. For the improved heat and mass transfer, the filler composing the evaporative cooling section 3 and the ventilating fan 5 must be enlarged, which results in an undesirable increase in the external volume of the cooling tower.
