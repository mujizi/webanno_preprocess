The remaining portions of knitted component 130 other than monofilament knit element 131, including peripheral portions such as throat portion 134 and collar portion 133, may incorporate various types of yarn that impart different properties to separate areas of upper 120. That is, one area of knitted component 130 may be formed from a first type of yarn that imparts a first set of properties, and another area of knitted component 130 may be formed from a second type of yarn that imparts a second set of properties. In an exemplary embodiment, peripheral portions of knitted component 130, including throat portion 134 and collar portion 133, may be formed from the first type of yarn and/or the second type of yarn. With this configuration, properties may vary throughout upper 120 by selecting specific yarns for different areas of knitted component 130.
The properties that a particular type of yarn will impart to an area of knitted component 130 partially depend upon the materials that form the various filaments and fibers within the yarn. Cotton, for example, provides a soft hand, natural aesthetics, and biodegradability. Elastane and stretch polyester each provide substantial stretch and recovery, with stretch polyester also providing recyclability. Rayon provides high luster and moisture absorption. Wool also provides high moisture absorption, in addition to insulating properties and biodegradability. Nylon is a durable and abrasion-resistant material with relatively high strength. Polyester is a hydrophobic material that also provides relatively high durability. In addition to materials, other aspects of the yarns selected for knitted component 130 may affect the properties of upper 120. For example, a yarn forming knitted component 130 may include separate filaments that are each formed of different materials. In addition, the yarn may include filaments that are each formed of two or more different materials, such as a bicomponent yarn with filaments having a sheath-core configuration or two halves formed of different materials. Different degrees of twist and crimping, as well as different deniers, may also affect the properties of upper 120. Accordingly, both the materials forming the yarn and other aspects of the yarn may be selected to impart a variety of properties to separate areas of upper 120.
In some configurations of knitted component 130, materials forming yarns may be non-fusible or fusible. For example, a non-fusible yarn may be substantially formed from a thermoset polyester material and fusible yarn may be at least partially formed from a thermoplastic polyester material. When a fusible yarn is heated and fused to non-fusible yarns, this process may have the effect of stiffening or rigidifying the structure of knitted component 130. Moreover, joining portions of non-fusible yarn using fusible yarns may have the effect of securing or locking the relative positions of non-fusible yarns within knitted component 130, thereby imparting stretch-resistance and stiffness. That is, portions of non-fusible yarn may not slide relative to each other when fused with the fusible yarn, thereby preventing warping or permanent stretching of knitted component 130 due to relative movement of the knit structure. Another feature of using fusible yarns in portions of knitted component 130 relates to limiting unraveling if a portion of knitted component 130 becomes damaged or one of the non-fusible yarns is severed. Accordingly, areas of knitted component 130 may be configured with both fusible and non-fusible yarns within the knit structure.
In an exemplary embodiment, upper 120 may include a first type of yarn that is knitted to form portions of knitted component 130 other than monofilament knit element 131. In one embodiment, peripheral portions of knitted component 130, including throat portion 134 and collar portion 133, are formed by knitting with the first type of yarn. In an exemplary embodiment, the first type of yarn is a natural or synthetic twisted fiber yarn. In contrast, monofilament knit element 131 incorporated into upper 120 may be formed by knitting with one or more monofilament strands to form knitted component 130 of unitary knit construction with the peripheral portions of knitted component 130 knitted with the first type of yarn. That is, monofilament knit element 131 is formed of unitary knit construction with the remaining portions of knitted component 130 so as to be a one-piece element. Accordingly, in this embodiment, monofilament knit element 131 is formed of unitary knit construction with throat portion 134 and collar portion 133 so as to be a one-piece element.
In some embodiments, knitted component 130 may include one or more boundary zones. A boundary zone defines the portion of knitted component 130 where the yarn used to knit knitted component 130 transitions from one yarn type to another yarn type. For example, knitted component 130 may transition from a first type of yarn to a monofilament strand forming monofilament knit element 131 at one or more boundary zones on upper 120. In an exemplary embodiment, the first type of yarn transitions from a natural or synthetic twisted fiber yarn to the monofilament strand at one or more boundary zones around collar portion 133 and/or along instep area 150 on either side of throat portion 134.
