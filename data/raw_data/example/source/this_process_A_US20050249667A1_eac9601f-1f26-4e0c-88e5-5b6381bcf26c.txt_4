[0765] As will apparent, one may use other analytical techniques to determine the degree to which the cells are synchronized in a specified phase. In one embodiment, the phase-sensitive flow cytometer described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,548 is used; the entire disclosure of this United States patent is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. This patent claims "1. A phase-sensitive flow cytometer for resolving fluorescence emissions from fluorochrome labeled cells into two components, comprising: flow cytometer means for providing a flow steam containing said labeled cells; an excitation light for exciting said labeled cells to fluoresce in said flow stream; modulation means for modulating said excitation light and generating a reference signal at a selected modulation frequency; detector means for receiving fluorescence emission spectra from said labeled cells as a modulated fluorescence signal and outputting a modulated intensity signal functionally related to said fluorescence emission spectra from said labeled cells; and phase detector means for resolving said modulated intensity signal into two signal components, each functionally related to a different fluorescence decay lifetime of said fluorescent emission spectra."
[0766] Referring again to FIG. 5, and in the preferred embodiment depicted therein, it is preferred to treat the cells with the synchronizing agent for at least about 25 minutes prior to it is contacted with ultrasound in step 266. It is more preferred to wait at least about 60 minutes prior to time one contacts the cells with ultrasound. In one embodiment, one waits at least about 4 hours until after first administration of the synchronizing agent until the cells are contacted with ultrasound. In one embodiment, a period of at at least about 48 hours is allowed to pass from the initial administration of the synchronizing agent before the cells so synchronized are contacted with the ultrasound energy.
[0767] Referring again to FIG. 5, and in step 262 of this process, microtubules in diseased cells are preferably stabilized by one or more conventional means. As is known to those skilled in the art, stabilization of microtubles at metaphase can result in the synchronization of a population of cells at the metaphase checkpoint of the cell division cycle.
[0768] Thus, e.g., one may effectuate such stabilization by using anti-mitotic or other chemical agents known to affect microtubules, or using chemicals that influence proteins that aid in the stabilization of microtubules (e.g. Rho or FAK), or a process of post-translational modification to the tubulin protein, until the half-life of an individual microtubule in the mitotic spindle of a dividing cell is an average of at least 8 minutes, or more than 10 percent of the microtubules in a non-dividing cell have a half-life of more than 8 minutes. One may use standard means for stabilizing the microtubules to this extent. Thus, e.g., reference may be had to U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,898 (method of stabilizing microtubules); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,616,608; 6,403,635; 6,414,015 (laulimalide microtubule stabilizing agents); U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,429,232; 6,500,859 (method for treating atherosclerosis or restenosis using microtubule stabilizing agent); U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,767 (coumarin compounds as microtubules stabilizing agents); U.S. Pat. No. 6,740,751 (methods and compositions for stabilizing microtubules and intermediate filaments); and the like. The entire disclosure of each of these United States patents is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification.
[0769] In step 264 of this process, the resonant frequency of the stabilized microtubules in the diseased cells to be treated is determined. As used herein, the term "resonant frequency" is that frequency which, at a power level of 10 milliwatts per square centimeter, a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, and atmospheric pressure, is sufficient to break at least 50 weight percent of the microtubules in the cell after an exposure time of five (5) minutes. That frequency which breaks the maximum number of microtubules under these conditions is the resonant frequency.
