In yet another embodiment of the invention encompasses reagents for detecting fungal infection, including A. fumigatus infection, which comprise at least one A. fumigatus-derived nucleic acid defined by any one of SEQ ID NO: 1-SEQ ID NO: 22156, or sequence-conservative or function-conservative variants thereof. Alternatively, the diagnostic reagents comprise nucleotide sequences that are contained within any open reading frames (ORFs), including preferably complete protein-coding sequences, contained within any of SEQ ID NO: 1-SEQ ID NO: 22156, or polypeptide sequences contained within any of SEQ ID NO: 22157-SEQ ID NO: 44266, or polypeptides of which any of the above sequences forms a part, or antibodies directed against any of the above peptide sequences or function-conservative variants and/or fragments thereof.
The invention further provides antibodies, preferably monoclonal antibodies, which specifically bind to the polypeptides of the invention. Methods are also provided for producing antibodies in a host animal. The methods of the invention comprise immunizing an animal with at least one A. fumigatus-derived immunogenic component, wherein the immunogenic component comprises one or more of the polypeptides encoded by any one of SEQ ID NO: 1-SEQ ID NO: 22156 or sequence-conservative or function-conservative variants thereof; or polypeptides that are contained within any ORFs, including complete protein-coding sequences, of which any of SEQ ID NO: 1-SEQ ID NO: 22156 forms a part; or polypeptide sequences contained within any of SEQ ID NO: 22157-SEQ ID NO: 44266; or polypeptides of which any of SEQ ID NO: 22157-SEQ ID NO: 44266 forms a part. Host animals include any warm blooded animal, including without limitation mammals and birds. Such antibodies have utility as reagents for immunoassays to evaluate the abundance and distribution of A. fumigatus-specific antigens.
In yet another aspect, the invention provides diagnostic methods for detecting A. fumigatus antigenic components or anti-A. fumigatus antibodies in a sample. A. fumigatus antigenic components may be detected by known processes, including but not limited to detection by a process comprising: (i) contacting a sample suspected to contain a fungal antigenic component with a fungal-specific antibody, under conditions in which a stable antigen-antibody complex can form between the antibody and fungal antigenic components in the sample; and (ii) detecting any antigen-antibody complex formed in step (i), wherein detection of an antigen-antibody complex indicates the presence of at least one fungal antigenic component in the sample. In different embodiments of this method, the antibodies used are directed against a sequence encoded by any of SEQ ID NO: 1-SEQ ID NO: 22156 or sequence-conservative or function-conservative variants thereof, or against a polypeptide sequence contained in any of SEQ ID NO: 22157-SEQ ID NO: 44266 or function-conservative variants thereof.
In yet another aspect, the invention provides a method for detecting antifungal-specific antibodies in a sample, which comprises: (i) contacting a sample suspected to contain antifungal-specific antibodies with an A. fumigatus antigenic component, under conditions in which a stable antigen-antibody complex can form between the A. fumigatus antigenic component and antifungal antibodies in the sample; and (ii) detecting any antigen-antibody complex formed in step (i), wherein detection of an antigen-antibody complex indicates the presence of antifungal antibodies in the sample. In different embodiments of this method, the antigenic component is encoded by a sequence contained in any of SEQ ID NO: 1-SEQ ID NO: 22156 or sequence-conservative and function-conservative variants thereof, or is a polypeptide sequence contained in any of SEQ ID NO: 22157-SEQ ID NO: 44266 or function-conservative variants thereof.
In another aspect, the invention features a method of generating vaccines for immunizing an individual against A. fumigatus. The method includes: immunizing a subject with an A. fumigatus polypeptide, e.g., a surface or secreted polypeptide, or a combination of such peptides or active portion(s) thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such vaccines have therapeutic and prophylactic utilities.
