[0221] Going back to block 714, if the DVD menu is not selected, the method proceeds to block 724 where a determination is made as to whether or not a DVD play control has been selected/activated. This may be accomplished by highlighting the Begin playing or resume playing movie option on the DVD feature menu, and thereafter pressing the play/pause button on the remote control. If the play control is not selected, the method proceeds back to block 712. If the play control is selected/activated, the method proceeds to block 722 where the DVD movie is presented. For example, the DVD feature menu is removed and the movie is outputted on the screen. Following block 722, the method proceeds to block 726 where a determination is made as to whether or not the menu button on the remote control is pressed. If the button has not been pressed, the method continues to output the movie. If the button has been pressed, the method proceeds to block 728 where the DVD movie is stopped and the location of the movie is retained for future use.
[0222] Thereafter, in block 730, the method includes going back to a menu. In one embodiment, the method includes going back to the DVD menu. In another embodiment, the method include going back to the DVD feature menu. In yet another embodiment, the method includes making a determination as to which menu instructed the movie to play, and then going back to the menu that instructed the movie to play. For example, if the method flowed through block 724, the method includes going back to block 712, and if the method flowed through block 720, the method includes going back to block 716.
[0223] One advantage of this method is the ability to navigate both sets of menus with a single menu button on a remote control. Conventional know how would use two dedicated buttons for these two tasks. This however, would confuse the user as they would be unsure which button does what.
[0224] FIG. 26B is a method 750 of operating a DVD player, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Method 750 may for example start from block 730 in FIG. 26A. In block 752, the DVD menu is presented after stopping the movie. Thereafter, in block 754, a determination is made as to whether or not the menu button on the remote control is pressed. If pressed, the method proceeds to block 758 where the DVD feature menu and DVD menu are integrated and presented. If not pressed, the method proceeds to block 756 where a determination is made as to whether or not a DVD play control has been selected/activated. If so, the method proceeds to block 770 where the movie resumes playing at the last marked location. If not, the method proceeds back to block 752.
[0225] Following block 758, the method proceeds to block 760 where a determination is made as to whether or not the menu button has been pressed. If pressed, the method proceeds to block 762 where the main menu is presented. Thereafter in block 764 a determination is made as to whether or not a DVD feature has been selected/activated. If so, the method proceeds back to block 758. If not, the method proceeds back to block 762. If the menu button is not pressed in block 760, the method proceeds to block 766 where a determination is made as to whether or not a DVD play control has been selected/activated. If so, the method proceeds to block 770 where the movie resumes playing at the last marked location. If not, the method proceeds back to block 752. If not, the method proceeds to block 768 where a determination is made as to whether or not the DVD menu has been selected. If so, the method proceeds to block 752. If not, the method proceeds back to block 758.
