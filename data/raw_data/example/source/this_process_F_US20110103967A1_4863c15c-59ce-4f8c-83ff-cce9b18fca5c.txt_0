[0040] High resistance to oxidation
[0041] Good wetting and encapsulation of the abrasive particles
[0042] In terms of production technology, the realization of the abrasive, single-crystal blade tip by the E-LMF method after preceding, conventional coating of the main blade section is particularly interesting: in this process sequence, existing production processes have to be modified only minimally and it is possible to dispense with the masking of the abrasive coating during the application of the MCrAlY protective coatings on the main blade section. The component (turbine blade 1) can therefore be used without carrying out further, subsequent steps immediately after the abrasive blade tip has been applied. It is advantageously possible to dispense with further heat treatment.
[0043] One possible production sequence for the production of an abrasive single-crystal turbine blade 1 according to the invention is shown in FIG. 3. An MCrAlY adhesive coating 11 is applied to the surface of a blade body 4, which consists of a single-crystal material, for example a single-crystal Ni-based superalloy, and a ceramic thermal barrier coating (TBC) 12 is applied in turn to said adhesive coating (see FIG. 3a). The coating on the radially outer blade tip 3, which is in the form of a crown in this exemplary embodiment, is removed mechanically and/or chemically, e.g. ground away, milled away or etched away (see FIG. 3b), such that the surface of the single-crystal basic body 4 at this point is free from protective coatings, i.e. is uncovered. According to the invention, an epitaxially solidified intermediate coating 5 and an abrasive coating 6 thereon are then applied by E-LMF (see FIG. 3c).
[0044] FIG. 4 shows photographic images of an exemplary realization of such an abrasive single-crystal blade tip 3, which was produced by the LMF method. Here, the blade tip 3 is designed as a crown. The radiation source used was a fiber-coupled high-power diode laser having an output power of 1000 W. The intermediate coating 5 (buffer coating), which is solidified epitaxially and in single-crystal form and is comprised of the alloy known commercially under the name Amdry 995, is firstly arranged on the single-crystal basic body 4 (nickel-based superalloy MK4) on the radially outer surface, the optimum microstructure of said coating also continuing at the interface with the overlying abrasive coating 6 which, in this exemplary embodiment, consists of Amdry 995 as binder material 7 and cBN particles embedded therein as abrasive material 8. Naturally, continuation of the single-crystal microstructure is no longer possible above the first abrasive particles 8.
