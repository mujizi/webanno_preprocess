[0109] Grams 32 and PLSIQ algorithms (Thermo-Galactic) are used to determine the correlation between the spectral features and the concentration of serotonin in ECF samples. The wavelength range best suited for serotonin between 1390 to 1450 cm.sup.-1. FIG. 26 shows the correlation between actual serotonin concentrations and predicted concentrations. At a concentration of 1.0.times.10.sup.-9 M serotonin, the R.sup.2, or determination value, in the model was 0.9756 and the detection limit was 1.00.times.10.sup.-10 M (3.times. signal to noise). FIG. 27 depicts several spectra of the 0507 tether reacted with serotonin in the ECF (notated as CSF Samples 1-3) along with a 1.times.10.sup.-6 M serotonin/tether spectrum in a buffered solution to show the correlation between ECF samples and a control. The peaks of interest can still be seen in the ECF samples and thus the concentration of serotonin level can be determined by the PLS algorithm.
[0110] In an alternative methodology, the paramagnetic particles can be chemically tethered to spectral enhancement particles. Nanoscale spinel iron oxide paramagnetic particles are again prepared as described above. However, instead of coating the paramagnetic particles with a SERS reactive metal, the paramagnetic particles are chemically tethered to a SERS reactive nanoparticle. SERS reactive silver nanoparticles are prepared using by a modified Lee and Meisel procedure. (Lee, P. C.; Meisel, D., Adsorption and surface-enhanced Raman of dyes on silver and gold sols. Journal of Physcial Chemistry 1982, 86, (17), 3391-5.) Ninety (90) mg of silver nitrate is dissolved in 500 mL of water in a 1000 mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a large stir bar. The solution is brought to a boil and 10 mL of 1% sodium citrate is added. The solution is boiled for an additional 30 minutes. The solution is then removed from the heat and allowed to cool to room temperature while continuing to stir. Once cool, the solution is rediluted to 500 ml.
[0111] The neurotransmitter specific coating for the silver nanoparticles is prepared by diazotizing 1.5 mg of a 0507 amine precursor (Corcoran Research Group, University of Wyoming) (as the stable amine) in a 1-dram screw top vial to create a 5.times.10.sup.-3 M solution of the activated 0507 tether. Nine hundred (900) .mu.L of absolute ethanol purchased from Aldrich and 100 .mu.L of p-toluene sulfonic acid solution (PTSA, 100 mg/mL in absolute ethanol) is added to 1.5 mg of the 0507 amine precursor. This solution is stirred with a micro-stir bar in an ice bath in a refrigerator at 0.degree. C. for 30 minutes. To form a diazonium, 2 .mu.L of butyl nitrite is added to the reaction mixture and stirred for an additional 30 minutes.
[0112] An equimolar amount of paramagnetic particles is then added to the tether solution with the SERS reactive silver particles. A chemical tether designed to join the paramagnetic particles to the silver particles is also added to the solution. An exemplary tether is a 1,10-phenanthroline-4,7-diol (Aldrich) coupled by mercaptoundecanoic acid chloride synthesized from mercaptoundecanoic acid (Aldrich) as shown in FIG. 28. This phenanthroline compound will bind strongly to the paramagnetic particles through the 1,10-phenanthroline and to the silver nanoparticles through the thiols. A fifty (50)-fold excess of the phenanthroline compound is added to the particle solution. The tethered particle solution is further diluted to 1.0.times.10.sup.-4 M with Millipore water for use in experiments to detect serotonin levels in samples as described above.
[0113] Conceptually, one can see how the ultimate limit of detection occurs with free floating silver colloidal particles. As the amount of serotonin decreases the coverage of serotonin tethered to the surface of a spectral enhancement particle decreases to the point of one or less per particle. One could decrease the number of silver particles to decrease the active SERS surface area. This would make the number of analytes tethered per spectral enhancement particle higher. But again a limit is rapidly reached where there are insufficient particles in the laser beam to produce a good signal.
