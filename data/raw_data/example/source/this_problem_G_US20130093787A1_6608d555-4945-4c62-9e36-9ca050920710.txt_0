[0045] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a system capable of generating a perspective display, according to one embodiment. It is becoming increasingly popular for service providers and device manufacturers to bundle or make available navigation and mapping services on an array of user devices (e.g., mobile handsets, computers, navigation devices, etc.). Such devices may utilize location-based technologies (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, cellular triangulation, assisted-GPS (A-GPS), etc.) to provide navigation and mapping information. One growing trend for these services is to move beyond two-dimensional (2D) maps and provide location services based on three-dimensional (3D) maps or representations of locations and/or routes of interest. For example, modern devices may utilize an augmented reality mode to superimpose graphics and text over video images showing points of interest (POIs) in front of the user. Moreover, certain devices may utilize perspective-based displays such as 3D representations (e.g., rendered 3D models) of buildings and streets to provide navigational, mapping, or other location-based information.
[0046] However, as previously discussed, such perspective-based displays can be complex and resource intensive to generate. For example, on a device with a touch screen, virtual POIs can be displayed as touchable buttons. This typically requires that the buttons be separated and have minimum screen dimensions. On a device with a camera, the virtual POIs can be displayed over the camera's viewfinder image. In most cases, it is desired that the representations (e.g., the touch buttons, icons, graphics, etc.) of the virtual POIs appears in the vicinity of the corresponding real world locations in the user interface. In addition, in the case of a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone, mobile handset, etc.), the available display is generally limited and can quickly become cluttered when there are many elements or items (e.g., POIs) to display. This cluttered display makes it much more difficult for a user to quickly identify important information. By way of example, in an augmented reality application, multiple nearby POIs can cause clutter in the display, making it difficult (if not impossible) to see all POIs. In other words, when there is a high density of POIs in the display, graphical representations (e.g., icons, labels, etc.) depicting the POIs can overlap and obscure one another. Therefore, service providers and device manufacturers face the problem of selecting a subset of the POIs or other items and then displaying them as separate buttons appearing near their location in the viewfinder. In other embodiments, service providers and device manufacturers may face the challenge of grouping and/or de-overlapping the representations to, for instance, declutter the perspective display. In addition, particularly for mobile devices, service providers face the additional problem of implementing a perspective-base display process that has enough computational efficiency for real-time or substantially real-time display.
[0047] To address this problem, a system 100 of FIG. 1 introduces the capability of generating a perspective display (e.g., an augmented reality display) by efficiently mapping and selecting items (e.g., POIs) for generating a perspective display. More specifically, in one embodiment, the system 100 generates a perspective display by converting geographic location information (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) of POIs to pixel locations in a user interface. In one embodiment, the locations are converted from coordinate information (e.g., latitude and longitude) to polar coordinates relative to a viewing location (e.g., location of a mobile device in an augmented reality display or a specified viewing location in a virtual reality display). Representations of the POIs are then mapped onto a predetermined surface (e.g., a cylinder or sphere) around the device using perspective information or an approximation of the perspective information (e.g., an artistic perspective). In one embodiment, the surface can be defined to extend beyond the visible range of a particular display (e.g., extend to a 360 degree representation of the area around a viewing location such as the cylinder or sphere mentioned above).
[0048] In one embodiment, the surface is then divided into an array of cells (e.g., a grid or other like pattern). In this way, representations of the POIs can be mapped to cover one or more of the cells and then arranged among the cells so that the representations do not overlap or substantially overlap. In one embodiment, the system 100 can employ a search process to locate non-overlapping cells or block of cells for associating with the representations of the POI. In some cases, the system 100 can discard any POI that cannot be assigned an empty cell or block of cells following the search process.
[0049] In one embodiment, to avoid discarding any POIs, the system 100 can employ means for grouping and/or de-overlapping the representations of the POIs. In one embodiment, to maximize the information (e.g., representations of POIs) presented to the user, the system 100 prioritizes the de-overlapping of close POIs to avoid grouping or clustering them. Then if de-overlapping is not possible (e.g., no more available display area), the system 100 can perform grouping. It is contemplated that the system 100 can vary the degree of grouping versus de-overlapping to balance the information presented against the available display resources.
