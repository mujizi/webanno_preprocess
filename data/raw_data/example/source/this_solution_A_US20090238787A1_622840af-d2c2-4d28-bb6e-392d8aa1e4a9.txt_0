Air Freshener in Gel Form
[0161] 5 g of Accurel (porous homo-polypropylene powder with 75% porosity, produced by Akzo Noble Faser AG, Obernburg, Germany) are charged with 15 g of the perfume oil from Example 4 by mixing both constituents under vacuum. The resulting powder is then stirred with 4.5 g of water under normal pressure (Mix 1). In a separate vessel, 2.5 g of carrageenan, 0.3 g of chloracetamide and 0.5 g of calcium chloride dehydrate are dissolved in 62 g of water with heating at a maximum of 75.degree. C. Mix 1 is introduced into this solution with stirring and is homogenised. The resulting, preferable still warm mixture is poured into the desired mould (balls, semi-spheres, pads, cylinders, cuboids, cubes, shells or the like). After cooling to approximately 20.degree. C., air fresheners are obtained in gel form, the charging of which with perfume oil from Example 4 is approximately 20%, based on the total weight of the air freshener.
