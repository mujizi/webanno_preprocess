Another electro-optical triangulation arrangement is illustrated in FIG. 6. There, the triangulation base is defined by two stationary light detectors 34, 34'. A highly directional, rotatable light source 36, such as a laser transmitter, is mounted under a transparent acrylic dome on top of the robot and is mechanically coupled with an electric motor coaxial with a high-resolution shaft encoder. A maximum signal is produced by detectors 34, 34' when hit by the beam from the rotating light source 36. This, with the aid of the shaft encoder, facilitates the determination of angles .alpha. and .beta., and thus of the actual location of the robot.
However, as the difference in height between the pool edge and the light source 36 varies due to the slope of the pool floor, means must be provided to ensure that the rotating laser beam will always hit the detectors 34, 34', even when the robot is at the deeper section of the pool.
The solution to this problem is represented in FIG. 7. There is seen a light-collector rod 38 made of a transparent plastic material, carrying a transmission grating 40, behind which is arranged a reflector 42. In dependence on the given wavelength of the light source 36, grating 40 is configured to maximize first-order beams and minimize zero and other order beams.
As seen in FIG. 7, a light ray B from source 36 which hits grating 40 at an angle of incidence of about 0.degree. is diffracted, producing a first-order beam that hits reflector 42 at an angle of incidence of about 30.degree., is then reflected, and arrives at grating 40 (from the rear) at the same angle of incidence. Passing through grating 40 to be again diffracted, it arrives at the opposite wall of rod 38 at an angle of incidence of about 60.degree. which, given the indices of refraction of the media involved (N.sub.rod =1.5; N.sub.water =1.33), is beyond the critical angle, producing total internal reflexion that confines the beam inside rod 38 and carries it upwards until it hits detector 34. Rod 38 must, of course, be long enough to intercept the beam also from the deepest positions of the beam. Head 44 accommodates a preamplifier to be connected to the interconnection box 28 (FIG. 6).
Yet another embodiment of the triangulation concept of the system according to the invention is illustrated in FIG. 8. There is seen, mounted under a transparent acrylic dome on top of the robot, a rotatable, highly direction-sensitive light detector 46 mechanically coupled with a high-resolution shaft encoder (not shown) driven by an electric motor. There are further provided four nondirectional light sources in the form of high-intensity infrared transmitters 48, 50, 52 and 54, attached below water level to one each of the pool walls, substantially at the center of the pool length and the pool width, thus dividing the pool into four quadrants I, II, III, IV. Each light source is modulated at a different frequency, enabling the robot to determine immediately in which quadrant it is moving, the two sources of that particular quadrant defining the instantaneous base for triangulation. At maximum stimulation of detector 46, the angle is read off the shaft encoder and the robot location is determined by triangulation. This embodiment is particularly suitable for very large swimming pools, as the large area is subdivided into smaller "cells," enhancing navigation accuracy.
