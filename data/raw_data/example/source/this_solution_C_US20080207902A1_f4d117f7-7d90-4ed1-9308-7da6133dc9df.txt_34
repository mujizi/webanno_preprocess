[0543]Methyl 3-(2-ethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)-3-oxopropionate
[0544]The compound of Example 77 (1.38 g) was dissolved in dimethyl carbonate (20 mL) in an argon atmosphere. To this solution, 60% sodium hydride (520 mg) was added and the mixture was refluxed for 30 min. After cooling, saturated aqueous ammonium chloride was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=1:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (1.66 g).
