[0041] As we described the light emitting sources of the present invention, with the method of setting optical path, the light emitting sources do not darken easily in the periphery of the light emitting sources, and brightness of the light emitting sources can be further equalized. In addition, as the brightness distribution of the light emitting sources becomes uniform, an equipment with this light emitting source can be made thinner. Furthermore, if more than one element with different luminous colors is used in a light source unit, and when it is used in a liquid crystal display system, color reproducibility can be improved, and color can be mixed uniformly even though thickness is decreased.
[0042] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, in light emitting sources comprising a reflecting member for reflecting light, a light guiding unit arranged on the side of a light reflecting surface of the reflecting member, and light emitting devices for outputting light to the light guiding unit, a method of outputting light to be output from light emitting sources is characterized in that the light emitting devices are arranged on an optimal axis of the reflecting member, that a part of the light guiding unit outputs light outputted from the light emitting device to the external, while after another part of the surface of the light guiding unit total reflects the light outputted from the light emitting device, a still further part of the surface of the light guiding unit total reflects it and orients it toward the reflecting member, that the part of the reflecting member reflects the light total reflected by the light irradiation surface of the light guiding unit to the direction being gradually away from the optical axis, and orients it to the periphery of the light guiding unit away from the optical axis, and that shapes of and a positional relationship among the reflecting member, the light guiding unit and the light emitting devices are such defined that the another part of the reflecting plate further reflects the light reflected by the another part of the optical waveguide so as to output it to the external from the surface of the optical waveguide.
[0043] With this method of outputting light, as we described in details the light emitting sources of the invention, the light emitting sources do not darken easily, and brightness of the light emitting sources can be further equalized. In addition, as brightness distribution of the light emitting sources is equalized, the light emitting sources can be made thinner. Furthermore, if the light emitting devices of red, blue and green are used as light emitting sources, and when they are used in a liquid crystal display system, color reproducibility can be better and colors can be mixed uniformly in spite of decreased thickness.
[0044] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an illumination system comprises a light emitting source array in which a plurality of light emitting sources of the present invention are arranged, and a power supply unit that supplies electricity to the light emitting source array. With these light emitting sources, the light emitting sources do not darken easily in the periphery of the light emitting sources, which can then be made thinner, and thus an illumination system that has uniform brightness and decreased thickness can be manufactured.
[0045] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a liquid crystal display system according to the present invention is characterized in that it comprises a light emitting source array in which a plurality of light emitting sources of the present invention are arranged, and a liquid crystal display panel placed opposite to the light emitting source array. With this liquid crystal display system, corners of respective pixels do not become dark easily, display of the liquid crystal display panel can be crisp, and the liquid crystal display system can be made thinner. Furthermore, color reproducibility can be improved in the color display liquid crystal display system.
