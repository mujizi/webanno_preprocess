For example, if an ink jet head 64 having an array of 64 nozzles for ejecting pigment 62 is used, and three drops are ejected into each color recess 36 at a drive frequency of 14.4 kHz (ejecting 14,400 drops per second), the time required to fill each of the color recesses 36 in an approximately 900,000 pixel display panel with pigment 62 is: 900,000.times.3 drops/(14,400 times.times.64 nozzles)=approximately 3 seconds. Even considering the time required to move the ink jet head 64 between color recesses 36, all color recesses 36 can be filled with pigment 62 in approximately two to three minutes. To assure the color recesses 36 are filled with a uniform amount of pigment 62, the ink jet head 64 is moved and otherwise controlled to control the position at which pigment is ejected.
When the pigment 62 contains solvent, the solvent is evaporated by heat treatment. Removing the solvent, however, causes the pigment 62 to contract. It is therefore necessary to fill the recesses with enough pigment 62 so that the thickness needed to assure the required color density remains after solvent evaporation and pigment shrinkage.
This process forms a color pattern layer 60 on the light transmitting layer 30 as shown in FIG. 3(B).
A second reinforcing layer 80 is then bonded to the color pattern layer 60 side of the light transmitting layer 30 with a third light transmitting layer precursor 72 disposed therebetween. This operation is the same as that for bonding with the first light transmitting layer precursor 32, and the light transmitting layer precursor 72 can also be selected from the materials available for use as light transmitting layer precursor 32.
By thus spreading the third light transmitting layer precursor 72 and applying an appropriate setting process to form a third light transmitting layer 70 as shown in FIG. 3(C), optical substrate 1 is achieved.
