[1264] Referring again to FIG. 58, step 9080 repeats the entire process of steps 9030 through 9070 numerous times during which the conditions of the insonification step and the second therapeutic agent step are altered. Each variation in steps 9030 and 9065 in ways that are described elsewhere in this disclosure or convention methods well known to those skilled in the art. By way of example, the second therapeutic agent may be incrementally increased or decreased. The object of this step is the accumulation of a data set in step 9070. Comparison of the accumulated data sets in 9080 allow for the identification of conditions in which microtubules are most effectively disassembled by the combined therapy of insonification and the second therapeutic agent.
[1265] In one preferred embodiment, the response seen at step 9070 includes decrease in time and increase in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the second therapeutic agent at or about the same time that it encounters sonic energy of said frequency and strength. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9070 includes an increase in time and decrease in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the second therapeutic agent at or about the same time that it encounters sonic energy of said frequency and strength. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9070 includes decrease in time and decrease in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the second therapeutic agent at or about the same time that it encounters sonic energy of said frequency and strength. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9070 includes an increase in time and increase in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the second therapeutic agent at or about the same time that it encounters sonic energy of said frequency and strength. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9070 includes no change in time or rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the second therapeutic agent at or about the same time that it encounters sonic energy of said frequency and strength.
[1266] FIG. 59 depicts a process 11000 for using sonic energy response, and in particular, absorption spectrum of the microtubules of the mitotic spindle, as an in vivo assay technique. It should be recognized that this process is an extension of Process 9000 in FIG. 48, and therefore, like steps are numbered identically. Referring to FIG. 49, for this specification, absorption spectrum as used in the previous sentence of this paragraph is defined as the collection and analysis of the data from the plurality of sonic energy receivers 8090 and the sonic energy emitter 8040 in FIG. 49. Such data includes the magnitude of incident sonic energy wave 8030, the magnitude of the transmitted sonic energy wave 8070, the magnitude of reflected sonic energy wave ????, and the magnitude of scattered sonic energy wave 8080.
[1267] Step 9050 comprises the analysis of the absorption spectrum from e.g., any of the embodiments depicted in FIGS. 49-55, to determine whether the spectrum is characteristic of dividing cells. In one embodiment, the absorption spectrum will show characteristics of dividing cells by exhibiting an increase in the absorption of sonic energy at about the resonance frequency of the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. An example of this response is depicted in FIG. 56. The object of these steps is to determine a baseline absorption spectrum of the dividing cells for evaluation of the effect of introducing the therapeutic agent under test.
[1268] Referring again to FIG. 59, step 9056 comprises the treatment with the therapeutic agent under test. By way of example, but not limitation, the second therapy may be thermal therapy, radiation, pharmaceutical therapy, or the like. By way of further example, the second regimen may be a combination of two or more therapies.
