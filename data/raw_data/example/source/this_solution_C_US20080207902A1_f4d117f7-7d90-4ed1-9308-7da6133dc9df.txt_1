[0171]The reaction involves a base such as sodium carbonate or cesium carbonate and is preferably carried out at 80.degree. C. to reflux temperature in a solvent such as THF, benzene, toluene, xylene or 1,4-dioxane in the presence of a palladacycle catalyst, such as tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium.
[0172]In Synthetic Pathway K, the compound represented by the general formula (1g) can be produced by treating the compound represented by the general formula (55) with MSH and reacting the resulting product with the compound represented by the general formula (8) in which G is a lower alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, as shown by the following general formula (8a):
[wherein R.sub.2 and R' are as defined above] in the presence of a base (Step K-3). Specifically, the compound represented by the general formula (55) is dissolved in an organic solvent such as THF, DMF, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene or methylene chloride. This solution is reacted with a solution of MSH in methylene chloride at 0.degree. C. to room temperature. Subsequently, the compound of the general formula (8a) is added, along with an inorganic base such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, and the reaction is allowed to proceed at 0.degree. C. to room temperature.
[0173]Of the compounds represented by the general formula (1), shown below by the general formula (1h) are compounds in which R.sub.3 is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a lower alkoxycarbonyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R.sub.6 is R.sub.7--(CH.sub.2).sub.m-- (wherein R.sub.7 is a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, a hydroxyl group or an aromatic or saturated heterocyclic ring that may contain 1 or 2 heteroatoms, and m is an integer of 1 or 2), and -- -- is a single bond:
[wherein Z is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a lower alkoxycarbonyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.4, R.sub.5, R.sub.7 and m are as defined above]. These compounds can be produced by reacting the compounds represented by the general formulas (1b), (1c) and (1d) with the compound represented by the following general formula (56):
