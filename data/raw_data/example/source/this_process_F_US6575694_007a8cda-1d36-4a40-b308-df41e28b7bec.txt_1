In operation of the gas turbine engine 10, in the event that a fan blade 34, or a portion of a fan blade 34, becomes detached it pierces the thin metallic casing 52, before encountering the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56, 56'. The thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56 are impacted by the fan blade 34, or portion of the fan blade 34, and effectively remove energy from the fan blade 34, or portion of the fan blade 34.
Each of the turns of the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56 has relatively low mass and hence relatively low inertia. This allows the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56, 56' to move with the detached fan blade 34, or portion of the fan blade 34. This movement spreads the impact energy over a larger area of the fan blade containment assembly 38 enabling the use of lower mass of material to contain the detached fan blade 34, or fan blade portion 34.
The detached fan blade 34, or portion of the fan blade 34, causes the corrugations 62 in the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56' to be straightened out and this process absorbs energy from the detached fan blade 34 or portion of a fan blade 34. As the corrugations 62 are straightened out in each turn of the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56', the adjacent thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56, 56' slide over each other and absorb more energy from the fan blade 34 by friction between the adjacent thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56'. As the corrugations 63 are straightened the welds between corrugations 62 on adjacent thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56' are broken also absorbing energy. As each turn of the thin corrugated metallic sheets 54 and 56,56' straightens over the impact region it stiffens locally and transfers load to material further from the impact region, this increases the proportion of the fan blade assembly 38 contributing to energy absorption.
The corrugations lead to a low-density structure with a greater stiffness to weight ratio than a solid casing of the same material.
The orientation of the corrugations relative to the axis of the gas turbine engine allows the elongation axially and circumferentially to be adjusted to an optimum for fan blade containment.
