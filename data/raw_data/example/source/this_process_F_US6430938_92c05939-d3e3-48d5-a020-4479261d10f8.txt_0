The geometry and pulsing configuration of the pulse tube refrigeration system is such that before the compression pulse from the driver passing through the working gas reaches the cold end of the pulse tube, the driver initiates the expansion phase. This causes the cooled compressed working gas at the cold end of the pulse tube to expand. The cold end of the pulse tube is the end adjacent the cold heat exchanger. This expansion causes the working gas within the pulse tube to be compressed in the direction of the warm end of the pulse tube and heat is removed from the warm end typically by use of a hot heat exchanger 25 by indirect heat exchange with cooling medium, such as water 26. Preferably the pulse tube refrigeration system employs an orifice 15 and reservoir 14 to maintain the gas displacement and pressure pulses in appropriate phases.
The warmer compressed pulse tube gas within the warm end of pulse tube 10 is processed in hot heat exchanger 25 and then into reservoir 14 through orifice 15. The gas motion, in appropriate phase with the pressure, is facilitated by incorporating orifice or valve 15 and a reservoir volume 14 where the gas is stored at an average pressure with small fluctuation. The size of reservoir 14 is sufficiently large so that essentially very little pressure oscillation occurs in it during the oscillating flow in the pulse tube. The inlet flow from the wave-generation device/piston 11 stops and the tube pressure decreases to a lower pressure. Gas from reservoir 14 at an average pressure passes through the orifice to the pulse tube, which is at the lower pressure. The further cooled expanded gas at the cold end of pulse tube 10 provides the refrigeration to the external load as it passes through the cold heat exchanger 13. Refrigeration from the further cooled working gas is thus passed by indirect heat exchange to the interior 2 of vessel 20 thereby serving to counter heat leak into the vessel and reduce or completely eliminate cryogenic fluid loss from the vessel due to such heat leak. The resulting warmer working gas is further warmed by processing in regenerator 12 as it cools the regenerator. Then it is ready to receive the next pulse. Cryogenic fluid may be withdrawn from vessel 20 such as through piping 27.
The orifice pulse tube refrigerator functions to provide refrigeration as the working fluid goes through cyclic compression and expansion in the pulse tube. The cycle is as follows: the pulse generator through timed compression and expansion phases causes the working gas at its warm end to be compressed and thereby heated. Since the compressed gas is at a higher pressure than the average pressure in the reservoir, it flows through the orifice into the reservoir and exchanges heat through the hot heat exchanger located at the hot end of the pulse tube. The flow stops when the pressure in the pulse tube is reduced to the average pressure. The pulse generator moves back and thus expands the gas at its warm end. The cold, low-pressure gas in the warm end of the pulse tube is forced toward the cold end of the pulse tube by the gas flow from the reservoir into the pulse tube through the orifice. This in turn pushes the further cooled gas at the cold end of the pulse tube to be processed through the heat exchanger at the cold end of the pulse tube. In this process it removes the heat from the fluid or other entity being cooled. This flow stops when the pressure in the pulse tube increases to the average pressure. The cycle is then repeated.
In FIG. 1 the cold heat exchanger is shown as being within the vessel interior 2 in the volume occupied by vapor. The cold heat exchanger could also be positioned so that it delivers at least some refrigeration directly to liquid within the vessel interior. In another embodiment the cold heat exchanger could be connected to a heat pipe or other heat transfer device which passes the refrigeration to the cryogenic vapor and/or cryogenic liquid within the vessel interior. In yet another embodiment, the cold heat exchanger could be positioned to deliver refrigeration directly to the insulation within the vessel interior.
FIG. 2 illustrates another embodiment of the invention wherein a heat pipe is used to deliver refrigeration from the cold heat exchanger to cryogenic liquid within the vessel interior. The numerals in FIG. 2 are the same as those of FIG. 1 for the common elements, and these common elements will not be described again in detail.
