a step for forming a color pattern layer by filling the color recesses in the light transmitting layer with pigment; and
a step for separating the second master from the light transmitting layer.
This method of the invention uses the color protrusions of the first master as a die for molding color recesses in the light transmitting layer. Then, using the curved surface parts of the second master, lenses are molded on the side opposite the color recesses. Finally, the color recesses are filled with pigment to form a color pattern layer. An optical substrate of which one surface functions as a microlens array and the other surface functions as a color filter is thus achieved.
Because the pigment is only filled to the color recesses and it is not necessary to separate the pigment from the master, the pigment is not deformed and voids do not occur. Furthermore, because the masters can be used repeatedly insofar as durability allows once manufactured, the steps required to produce the masters can be eliminated from the production process for the second and subsequent optical substrates, thereby further reducing the number of production steps and helping to further reduce cost.
(2) In the method described in (1) above, the step for forming the light transmitting layer can bond the first and second masters with the color protrusions of the first master opposite the curved surface parts of the second master. This assures that light gathered by each lens passes each pixel of the color filter.
