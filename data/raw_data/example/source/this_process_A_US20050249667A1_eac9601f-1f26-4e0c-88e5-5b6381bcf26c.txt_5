[0767] Referring again to FIG. 5, and in step 262 of this process, microtubules in diseased cells are preferably stabilized by one or more conventional means. As is known to those skilled in the art, stabilization of microtubles at metaphase can result in the synchronization of a population of cells at the metaphase checkpoint of the cell division cycle.
[0768] Thus, e.g., one may effectuate such stabilization by using anti-mitotic or other chemical agents known to affect microtubules, or using chemicals that influence proteins that aid in the stabilization of microtubules (e.g. Rho or FAK), or a process of post-translational modification to the tubulin protein, until the half-life of an individual microtubule in the mitotic spindle of a dividing cell is an average of at least 8 minutes, or more than 10 percent of the microtubules in a non-dividing cell have a half-life of more than 8 minutes. One may use standard means for stabilizing the microtubules to this extent. Thus, e.g., reference may be had to U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,898 (method of stabilizing microtubules); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,616,608; 6,403,635; 6,414,015 (laulimalide microtubule stabilizing agents); U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,429,232; 6,500,859 (method for treating atherosclerosis or restenosis using microtubule stabilizing agent); U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,767 (coumarin compounds as microtubules stabilizing agents); U.S. Pat. No. 6,740,751 (methods and compositions for stabilizing microtubules and intermediate filaments); and the like. The entire disclosure of each of these United States patents is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification.
[0769] In step 264 of this process, the resonant frequency of the stabilized microtubules in the diseased cells to be treated is determined. As used herein, the term "resonant frequency" is that frequency which, at a power level of 10 milliwatts per square centimeter, a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, and atmospheric pressure, is sufficient to break at least 50 weight percent of the microtubules in the cell after an exposure time of five (5) minutes. That frequency which breaks the maximum number of microtubules under these conditions is the resonant frequency.
[0770] In step 264 of the process depicted in FIG. 5, an estimate of the energy and wavelengths associated with the vibration of microtubules from an external source is conducted. By way of illustration and not limitation, and without being bound to any particular theory, applicants believe that such an estimate may be readily made in accordance with the discussion and the equations presented elsewhere in this specification.
