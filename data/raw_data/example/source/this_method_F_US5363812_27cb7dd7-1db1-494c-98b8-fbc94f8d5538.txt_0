Thus, one aspect of the present invention is drawn to a circulating fluidized bed reactor having an enclosure for containing and conveying a circulating fluidized bed of material, said enclosure having a lower portion and an upper portion. A primary particle separator means is provided for collecting particles entrained within a gas flowing through and from said reactor enclosure. Means are provided for returning the particles collected by said primary particle separator means back to the lower portion of said reactor enclosure. Secondary particle separator means are provided for further collecting particles entrained and still remaining within the gas flowing from said reactor enclosure after the gas has passed through said primary particle separator means. Particle storage means are provided to store particles collected by said secondary particle separator means. The particle storage means has a storage capacity determined by a range of variation of a circulating solids inventory in the reactor enclosure required for bed temperature control, considering expected variability of fuel and sorbent properties and load changes of said reactor. A recirculating system is provided for controllably recirculating the particles collected by said secondary particle separator means and stored in said particle storage means back into the lower portion of said reactor enclosure. A bed temperature control system is provided for controlling a recirculation rate of solids from said particle storage means into said reactor enclosure to change an inventory of circulating solids in the circulating fluidized bed reactor as required to control a temperature of the circulating fluidized bed in said reactor enclosure. Finally, a solids level control system, interacting with said bed temperature control system, is provided for controlling the inventory of solids in said particle storage means as required for bed temperature control.
Another aspect of the present invention is also drawn to a circulating fluidized bed reactor; in this embodiment, however, the particle storage means is at a remote location from said secondary particle separator means.
Yet another aspect of the present invention is drawn to a method for controlling a bed temperature of a circulating fluidized bed of solids material contained within and conveyed through a reactor enclosure of a circulating fluidized bed reactor, said reactor including primary and secondary particle separator means. The steps of this method comprise collecting particles entrained within a gas flowing through and from said reactor enclosure in said primary particle separator means and uncontrollably returning said particles to a lower portion of said reactor enclosure. The secondary particle collector is used to further collect particles entrained and still remaining within the gas flowing from said reactor enclosure, after the gas has passed through said primary particle separator means. These further collected particles collected by said secondary particle collector are stored in particle storage means and are controllably recirculated from a hopper connected to said particle storage means back into the lower portion of the reactor enclosure to change an inventory of circulating solids in the circulating fluidized bed reactor as required to control the bed temperature of the circulating fluidized bed in said reactor enclosure.
