BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The problem of mobile devices being used by people while operating vehicles is well-known. Drivers become distracted by these devices, and are at a higher risk of being involved in a driving-related incident. As discussed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/956,067, filed Dec. 13, 2007, one useful approach to mitigating this problem involves monitoring the speed at which a mobile device is traveling. When the mobile device is in transit (typically determined by comparing the speed of the mobile device to a predetermined threshold), access control messages are transmitted either by the mobile communications device itself or a vehicle associated with the mobile device. The access control messages indicate to the mobile device communications network that communication with the mobile communications device should be prevented or deflected until the mobile device is no longer in transit. Another useful approach is described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/040,581, filed Feb. 29, 2008, which includes a mobile phone-based system for disabling a cellular phone when the phone is known to be moving at a predetermined speed. These co-pending applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.
[0002] In some embodiments of the mobile device control technologies described in the above pending applications, positioning systems, such as GPS, are used to determine where the mobile device is located and/or how fast the mobile device is moving. Such positioning systems typically have high power requirements. Consequently, when these systems are included within a battery-powered mobile device, the battery is quickly drained, especially when the positioning system is operated continuously or frequently. Additionally, many such systems rely on a line-of-sight communication path between the mobile device and a satellite or other transmitter. When the mobile device is being used indoors, or in urban areas, no sufficient communication path may exist. To mitigate power consumption, other less "power hungry" motion detection devices are sometimes used. For example, the location technique described by Horvitz et al. in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0005243, published Jan. 4, 2007, only turns on the GPS when an accelerometer indicates that, for example, "the velocity of a user is seen to decelerate from 60 miles per hour to 40 to 30 to 10 to 5 to 2 miles per hour." In the examples described by Gopinath in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0278738, published Nov. 12, 2009, microelectromechanical devices, such an accelerometer or gyroscope, are used to determine relative positions (instead of using GPS to obtain absolute positions).
