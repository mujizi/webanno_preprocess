3-acetyl-2-ethyl-4-methoxy-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0206]The compound of Example 5 (29.8 g) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (100 mL). To this solution, 3-hexyne-2-one (10 mL) and potassium carbonate (37.9 g) were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. Subsequently, ice water was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, washed sequentially with water (.times.2) and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=10:1 to 5:1) to afford the title compound as a yellow powder (8.02 g).
