[0070] Next, a scheduler step 316 and a DL grant step 318 are performed. The scheduler decides which time/frequency resources of a Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) are assigned for DL transmission to the UE. The time/frequency resources are expressed in terms of the assigned Resource Blocks (RB), with one RB comprising 12 sub-carriers of frequency resource during one 0.5 ms slot of time resource. This assignment information along with other transmission parameters, form the DL grant are transmitted as downlink control information (DCI) on the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) to the UE at step 320. This information is detected and recorded by the UE, and used for detection of the data sent on PDSCH at step 322.
[0071] Next, a transport block processing step 324 is performed. Data arrives from a higher layer in the form of transport blocks (TBs). In current releases of LTE, a maximum of two TBs are transmitted in each transmission time interval (TTI). Each TB is encoded into a codeword in a few steps as shown in FIG. 5. First, a Cyclic Redundancy Check field (CRC) is attached to the TB. If the size of the TB is larger than a certain value, code block segmentation is applied to divide the TB into smaller blocks termed code blocks. Channel coding is applied on each code block separately. Rate matching is applied based on the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) assigned to the UE. Finally, the rate matched coded bits are concatenated to form a codeword.
[0072] Next, a physical channel processing step 326 is performed. The codeword formed by the coding unit is converted into OFDM symbols to be transmitted on the DL channel. FIG. 6 shows the steps involved in this process. Each codeword is first scrambled by a cell-specific scrambling sequence. The scrambled bits are then modulated to form modulation symbols. The modulation symbols from all codewords are mapped to layers, where the number of layers (or transmit rank) is indicated in the DL grant carried in the PDCCH. Subsequently, the precoding is applied to the data layers to form the signals for each antenna port. The output of the precoder is mapped to resource elements in the frequency domain and then the OFDM signal in time domain is generated and transmitted over each antenna port. A Resource Element (RE) is a minimum unit of time/frequency resource, defined in the LTE system as one OFDM symbol duration in time and one sub-carrier in frequency.
[0073] The block diagram of FIG. 3 describes the procedures for downlink data transmission in a non-CoMP transmission. For CoMP transmission, some of these procedural components may need to be modified to fully utilize the potential of cooperative communications.
[0074] There are a plurality of feedback and transmission methods for multi-point operation. One such method feeds back a joint CSI. In this method, multiple TPs are considered together as a virtual single TP. Denoting the channel matrix from TP i to the UE by Hi, the composite channel from this virtual single TP to the UE is equal to
