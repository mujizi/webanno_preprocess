[0187]A solution of 14 (11.0 g, 25.3 mmol) in dry 1,2-dichloroethane (50 ml) was placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and cooled to 0.degree. C. TMSOTf (4.6 ml, 25.4 mmol) was then added and the reaction was stirred for 1.5 hours at 0.degree. C. The reaction was then quenched with saturated NaHCO.sub.3 (100 ml) and 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (6.5 g, 25.2 mmol) was added slowly as a gas evolved. The bi-phasic mixture was stirred vigoursouly for 5 hours and then diluted with CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 (50 ml). The organic layer was separated, washed with saturated NaHCO.sub.3 (2.times.50 ml), 10% HCl (2.times.50 ml), and brine (50 ml). The organic layer was then dried with MgSO.sub.4, filtered and evaporated and crude material was purified by flash chromatography using 30% ethyl acetate and 70% hexanes to give 15 in 85.8% yield (12.1 g) as a clear oil. MS: calc 557.66; found 580 (M+Na.sup.+)
Step 3: (3R,4S,5S)-5-((3-(((9H-fluoren-9-yl)methoxy)carbonylamino-4-methox-y-4-oxobutylthio)methyl)-tetrahydrofuran-2,3,4-triyl triacetate 16
[0188]A solution of 15 (10 g, 17.9 mmol) in trifluoroacetic acid (20 ml) and H.sub.2O (20 ml) was stirred at room temperature for 5 hours. H.sub.2O (100 ml) was then added slowly and a white solid precipitated from the solution. After this mixture had stirred for 0.5 hours, the precipitate was filtered and dried under high vacuum. The precipitate was added to a solution of dry CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 (100 ml) and dry pyridine (20 ml) under a nitrogen atmosphere and cooled to 0.degree. C. Acetyl chloride (8.9 ml, 0.125 mol) was added slowly to this solution via syringe over a period of one hour and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight as it warmed to room temperature. The reaction was then quenched slowly with saturated NaHCO.sub.3. The quenched reaction was stirred for an additional 0.5 hours and then the organic phase was separated, washed with saturated NaHCO.sub.3 (2.times.100 ml) and brine (100 ml), dried with MgSO.sub.4, filtered and evaporated and the crude material was purified by flash chromatography using 30% ethyl acetate and 70% hexanes to give the title compound 16 in 77.2% yield (8.7 g) as a mixture of .alpha. and .beta. isomers (1:1.7 molar ratio respectively by .sup.1H NMR). MS: calc 629.67; found 652 (M+Na.sup.+)
Step 4: (2S,3S,4R,5R)-2-((3-(((9H-fluoren-9-yl)methoxy)carbonylamino)-4-me-thoxy-4-oxobutylthio)methyl)-5-(6-chloro-9H-purin-9-yl)-tetrahydrofuran-3,-4-diyl diacetate 18
[0189]A solution of 6-chloropurine 17 (368 mg, 2.38 mmol) and N,O-bistrimethylsilylacetomide (588 .mu.l, 2.38 mmol) in dry acetonitrile (10 ml) was stirred for 1/2 hour at room temperature under an N.sub.2 atmosphere. 16 (1.0 g, 1.59 mmol), in dry acetonitrile (10 ml), was then added followed by TMSOTf (287 .mu.l, 1.59 mmol) and the mixture was refluxed for 1/2 hour. After the reaction had cooled to room temperature, it was poured into saturated NaHCO.sub.3 (100 ml) and extracted into ethyl acetate. The organic phase was then washed With brine (50 ml), dried with Na.sub.2SO.sub.4, filtered and evaporated and the crude material was purified by flash chromatography using 95% CH.sub.2CO.sub.2 and 5% acetone to give the title compound 18 in 78.2% yield (900 mg).
