[0006]Another type of document collaboration tool, such as WebX or LiveMeeting, enables web collaboration via a centralized conference server deployed on the Internet. If the host is presenting a document on his/her PC, then the document collaboration tool converts the format of the document to an image format that can be recognized by a browser (i.e., Internet Explorer) on the other participant's PCs. For example, the LiveMeeting tool converts documents to a Live Meeting format (.lmp). The document collaboration tool then uploads the converted document to the conference server. The other participants may then view the document through their browser on their PCs over the Internet.
[0007]There are problems providing online collaboration in this manner. First, by converting the documents to image files, moving picture content (e.g., PPT customized animation, moving GIF, etc) cannot be displayed to the other participants. Secondly, there is an increased risk of the important business secrets being disclosed because these documents are uploaded and shared via public internet access. Third, the quality of the conference voice and video can't be guaranteed when transmitting over the Internet.
[0008]Some online conference tools also provide dedicated equipment to mix the collaboration data into the conference voice path to share among the participants' PCs, such as Polycom's "Voice+Content" solution. Unfortunately, this solution requires that each conference location has this dedicated equipment installed and connected to the conference endpoints. Using this dedicated equipment can be costly to install, and can be inconvenient as the participants have to gather in a location where the dedicated equipment is installed.
SUMMARY OF THE SOLUTION
[0009]The invention solves the above and other related problems with improved online conferencing systems and methods.
