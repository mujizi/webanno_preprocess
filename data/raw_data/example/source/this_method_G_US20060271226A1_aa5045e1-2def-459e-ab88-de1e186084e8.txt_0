[0006] However, an intermediate product which satisfies a certain quality level does not always become a good product at the last stage. Even when the intermediate product satisfies the quality level, it could contain a potential defect factor which induces a defect in the following process. Such a potential defect factor is referred to as a "defect sign" hereinafter. Thus it is desirable to reject not only the intermediate product that does not satisfy the quality leave, but also an intermediate product that has a defect sign, preventing the defect from being generated in the following processes.
[0007] Nonetheless, it is very difficult to appropriately set an inspection standard to detect the defect sign because it is difficult to clarify and quantify a causal correlation between the degree of the defect sign and probability of defect generation in the following process. Furthermore, when there are several inspection items in the process inspection, it is difficult to specify which inspection standard of the inspection items was effectively adjusted. If the inspection standard is too strict because of a high priority on finding a defect sign, the yield rate (the rate of the number of the accepted products to the total number in the inspection) is lowered, causing the yield to deteriorate or reinspection costs to increase.
[0008] A technique to support inspection standard settingis disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-214394 and is well known. However, according to this method, although an over detection rate of the inspection result is calculated and displayed for a user to confirm whether or not the over detection rate satisfies a predetermined management standard, it only urges the user to determine whether it is necessary to adjust an inspection standard. That is, this method is cannot be used for determining how the inspection standard of an inspection item of a certain process is adjusted.
[0009] In view of the above circumstances herein is provided a technique for appropriately setting an inspection standard to detect a defect sign in a process inspection.
[0010] The present invention provides a technique to set inspection standards (or support to set the inspection standard) for a plurality of inspection items on a production line which executes a process inspection determining pass or fail of an intermediate product by comparing a feature extracted from the intermediate product with a predetermined inspection standard, and a final inspection determining pass or fail of a completed product at a final process.
