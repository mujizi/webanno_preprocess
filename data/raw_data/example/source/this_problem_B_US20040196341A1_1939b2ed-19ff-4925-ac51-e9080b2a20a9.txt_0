Other Constructions of Valve Closing Plate
[0125] FIGS. 13A and 13B and FIGS. 14A and 14B show other example constructions of the valve closing plate 32. In these constructions, the valve closing plate 32 differs in plan-view shape from the previous embodiment.
[0126] FIGS. 13A and 13B are a plan view and a cross-sectional view of a one-way valve constructed of a valve closing plate 32 almost circular when viewed from above. The valve closing plate of the previous embodiment has a roughly rectangular shape in plan view as shown in FIG. 3. With such a rectangular valve closing plate, a side surface of a roughly rectangular prism-shaped ink tank (liquid container) and a side surface of the one-way valve can be set flush with each other. This arrangement has an advantage of being able to enhance an efficiency of accommodating ink in the ink tank. However, since the valve closing plate is rectangular, undulations in the undulated portion of the flexible sheet cross each other at portions corresponding to the vertices of the valve closing plate, slightly increasing the stiffness of the flexible sheet at these corners. To deal with this problem, the valve closing plate 32 is formed almost circular in plan view, as shown in FIG. 13A, to eliminate the intersecting portions and thereby allow the flexible sheet 31 to be deformed more smoothly.
[0127] In FIGS. 14A and 14B, the valve closing plate 32 is formed almost rectangular in plan view, with its four corners rounded or curved. It is seen that, if the plan-view shape of the valve closing plate 32 is rectangular, this arrangement makes it possible to prevent the undulations of the undulated portion of the flexible sheet from crossing each other at portions corresponding to the vertices of the valve closing plate and therefore the stiffness of the flexible sheet from increasing locally.
