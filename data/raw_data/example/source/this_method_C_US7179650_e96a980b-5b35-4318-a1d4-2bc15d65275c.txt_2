A method of inhibiting or modulating sentrin polypeptide function in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal a composition comprising an antibody that specifically binds a sentrin polypeptide.
A method of determining the aggressiveness of a tumor, comprising determining the amount of a sentrin polypeptide produced by a cell and comparing the amount so produced with a normal cell wherein overexpression of the protein is indicative of the aggressiveness of the tumor.
Another embodiment of the invention is a method of producing cell-death in a tumor cell. This method comprises contacting the tumor cell with a composition effective to prevent sentrinization in the cell. The sentrinization may be prevented by blocking the interaction of sentrin and Ubc9, and the composition may comprise a C-terminal peptide fragment of sentrin, or alternatively, a small inhibitor molecule which interacts with sentrin to prevent sentrinization from occurring in the cell. Preferably, the composition comprises an amount of a polypeptide effective to inhibit TNFR- or Fas/APO-1-induced apoptosis.
2.1 Sentrin Affects Apoptosis
Sentrin-1 has several unique features which distinguish it from known death-domain associated proteins. Sentrin-1 does not comprise any known death domain sequences, yet it binds to both Fas/APO-1 and TNFR1, but not CD40 or FADD/MORT1. Sentrin-1 protects the cells from both anti-Fas/APO-1 and TNF-mediated cell death. While the precise mechanism whereby sentrin-1 blocks cell death signaling is not clear, sentrin-1 appears to prevent binding of FADD/MORT1 or TRADD or other proteins to Fas/APO-1 and TNFR1 thus interrupting the signaling pathway. Alternatively, a more complex regulation mediated by sentrin-1 can be envisioned Sentrin most likely does not compete with the ubiquitin mediated pathway of protein degradation. Ubiquitination and "sentrinization" represent distinct pathways each with a specific target.
