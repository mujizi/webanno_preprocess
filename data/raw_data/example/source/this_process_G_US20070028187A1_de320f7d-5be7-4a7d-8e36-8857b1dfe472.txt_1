[0176] In this embodiment, the switching unit 1902 instructs the display processing unit 1901 to rotate the virtual cube at every time interval optimum for the user to set functions in the MFP 1. The switching unit 1902 instructs the display processing unit 1901 to rotate the virtual cube every three seconds as the optimum time interval. It goes without saying that this embodiment does not limit a predetermined time for rotating the virtual cube to three seconds.
[0177] This embodiment does not limit the instruction of the switching unit 1902 for rotating the virtual cube to be performed every predetermined time. The switching unit may instruct the display processing unit to rotate the virtual cube when a selection accepting unit accepts an input instructing to rotate the virtual cube from the user. The switching unit may instruct the display processing unit to rotate the virtual cube based on any conditions.
[0178] FIG. 21 is a diagram for explaining an example at the time when the display processing unit 1901 rotates the virtual cube according to the control by the switching unit 1902. As shown in the figure, the switching unit 1902 controls the rotation of the virtual cube and switches the surfaces having the input function markings shown thereon and the surfaces having the output function markings shown thereon. Specifically, the display processing unit 1901 and the switching unit 1902 rest the virtual cube in a state in which the surfaces having the input function markings shown thereon or the surfaces having the output function markings shown thereon are displayed on the liquid crystal touch panel 320. When three seconds pass after the virtual cube rests, the display processing unit 1901 and the switching unit 1902 rotate the virtual cube by half. After the half rotation of the virtual cube, the display processing unit 1901 and the switching unit 1902 rest the virtual cube in a state in which the surfaces having the input function markings shown thereon or the surfaces having the output function markings shown thereon, which are not displayed earlier, are shown on the liquid crystal touch panel 320. The display processing unit 1901 and the switching unit 1902 repeat this processing.
[0179] When the surfaces having the input function markings shown thereon are displayed on the liquid crystal touch panel 320, the display processing unit 1901 displays a surface 2101 having RECEIVE shown thereon, a surface 2102 having SCAN shown thereon, and a surface 2103 having LOAD shown thereon. When the surfaces having the output function markings shown thereon are displayed on the liquid crystal touch panel 320, the display processing unit 1901 displays SEND 2104, PRINT 2105, and SAVE 2106. Since these functions are the same as those in the first embodiment, explanations of the functions are omitted.
[0180] The display processing unit 1901 rotates the virtual cube on the liquid crystal touch panel 320 around a rotation axis shown in FIG. 21. The virtual cube is repeatedly rotated and rested on the liquid crystal touch panel 320. In a stationary state, the display processing unit 1901 displays the virtual cube, using the rotation axis, such that an area of the surfaces having the input function markings shown thereon and an area of the surfaces having the output function markings shown thereon are substantially equal. This rotation axis does not pierce through vertexes of corners of the virtual cube but pierces through surfaces of the virtual cube. When the display processing unit 1901 displays the virtual cube in this way, areas of the respective surfaces, selection of which is accepted, are equal. Thus, it is easy for the user to depress the respective surfaces.
