[0196] 2 g of the binder solution (A1) (containing 0.1 g of the binder polymer (B1)) and 40 g of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether were placed in a beaker having a volume of 150 mL followed by stirring and mixing. Next, 1.2 g of an electroconductive polymer aqueous solution (C1), having an NV of 4.0% and containing polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDT) and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), 55 g of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, 0.05 g of polyether-modified polydimethylsiloxane-based leveling agent (BYK Chemie GmbH, trade name: "BYK-300", NV: 52%) and a melamine-based crosslinking agent were further added to the beaker followed by mixing well by stirring for about 20 minutes. Thus, a coating composition (D1) was prepared that had an NV value of 0.18% and contained 50 parts of an electroconductive polymer, 30 parts of lubricant (both based on the solid fractions thereof) and a melamine-based crosslinking agent based on 100 parts of the binder polymer (B1) (base resin).
[0197] <Antistatic Coating Composition (D2)>
[0198] The main agent, "BONDEIP PA-200" (Konishi Co., Ltd., NV: 32%), used as an antistatic agent was adjusted to an NV value of 2.1% by diluting with a mixed solvent of isopropyl alcohol and soft water present in a weight ratio of 2:1. 25 parts of the curing agent, "BONDEIP PA-100" (Konishi Co., Ltd., NV: 8.2%), were added to 100 parts of this solution to obtain a solution having an NV value of 2.5%. A coating composition (D2) was prepared by diluting this solution to an NV value of 1.15% by addition of isopropyl alcohol.
[0199] <PSA Composition (G1)>
[0200] 199 parts of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (2EHA), 1 part of a reactive surfactant (Kao Corp., trade name: "Latemul PD-420"), 8 parts of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), 0.4 parts of AIBN and 386 parts of ethyl acetate were placed in a four-mouth flask equipped with a stirring blade, thermometer, nitrogen gas feed tube, condenser and dropping funnel followed by introducing nitrogen gas while stirring gently, holding the temperature of the liquid in the flask to the vicinity of 65.degree. C. and carrying out a polymerization reaction for 6 hours to prepare an acrylic polymer (P1) solution having an NV value of 35%. The Tg of this acrylic polymer (P1) was -10.degree. C. or lower, the Mw was 41.times.10.sup.4, and the acid value was 0.0 mgKOH/g.
