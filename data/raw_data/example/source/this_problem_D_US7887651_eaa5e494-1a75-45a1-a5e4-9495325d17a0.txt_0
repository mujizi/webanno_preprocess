If the size of the mixer is reduced, the number of munitions to be filled per mixture is reduced, which is penalising economically.
The person skilled in the art has tried to break this circle of pot life/heat-curing duration, and this obligatory and precise sequencing of the mixing and moulding operations.
J. M. TAUZIA, in a communication entitled "Some comments on Processing Energetic Materials" at the "Compatibility and Processing" symposium organized by the American Defense Preparedness Association (ADPA) on 23-25 Oct. 1989 at Virginia Beach (United States) suggested, to resolve this problem, a two-component method in which two chemically stable polymeric components presenting approximately the same proportion of charge and the same viscosity are first produced, from the constituents, discontinuously in mixers.
These two paste components are then mixed continuously with a mass ratio of close to 1.
This two-component method, while indeed easing the pot life/heat-curing duration compromise and making it possible for the two components to be stored for several weeks, does present several disadvantages.
