In step 1, an alkylbenzoyl-nitrobenzene 6 is prepared by reacting alkylbenzene if with an acylating agent 2f where L is a leaving group such as chloro, under Friedel-Crafts acylating conditions. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a Lewis acid such as aluminum chloride or boron trifluoride, and the like. Suitable solvents for the reaction include halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, carbon disulfide, and the like, preferably carbon disulfide.
In step 2, a phenylamine compound of formula Ib is prepared by the reduction of the keto group and nitro group of the compound of formula 6, utilizing the reaction conditions described in Scheme A, route (a), step 4.
An exemplary preparation of a compound of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compound of formula Ib is described in detail in Example 5.
Scheme C
Scheme C describes an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 is a group represented by formula (A) and R.sup.3 is --(CH.sub.2).sub.m NR.sup.7 SO.sub.2 R.sup.9, from the corresponding intermediate compounds of formula IC. ##STR11##
