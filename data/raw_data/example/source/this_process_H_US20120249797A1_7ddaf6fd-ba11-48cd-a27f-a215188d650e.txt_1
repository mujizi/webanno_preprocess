[0639] In one embodiment, the wrist mounted assembly 5600 includes the following elements in case 5601: straps 5602, setting and on/off buttons 5603, protective cover for sensor 5604, pressure-driven sensor 4405, and a keyboard and LCD screen 5606.
[0640] The fingerprint, palm print, geo-location, and POI enrollments device includes an integrated computer, QWERTY keyboard, and display. The display is designed to allow easy operation in strong sunlight and uses an LCD screen or LED indicator to alert the operator of successful fingerprint and palm print capture. The display uses transflective QVGA color, with a backlit LCD screen to improve readability. The device is lightweight and compact, weighing 16 oz. and measuring 5''.times.2.5'' at the mosaic sensor. This compact size and weight allows the device to slip into an LBV pocket or be strapped to a user's forearm, as shown in FIG. 56. As with other devices incorporating the mosaic sensor, all POIs are tagged with geo-location information at the time of capture.
[0641] The size of the sensor screen allows 10 fingers, palm, four-finger slap, and finger tip capture. The sensor incorporates a large pressure driven print sensor for rapid enrollment in any weather conditions as specified in MIL-STD-810, at a rate of 500 dpi. Software algorithms support both fingerprint and palm print capture modes and uses a Linux operating system for device management. Capture is rapid, due to the 720 MHz processor with 533 MHZ DSP. This processing capability delivers correctly formatted, salient images to any existing approved system software. In addition, the device is also fully EFTS/EBTS compliant, including ITL 1-2007 and WSQ.
[0642] As with other mosaic sensor devices, communication in wireless mode is possible using a removable UWB wireless 256-bit AES transceiver. This also provides secure upload and download to and from biometric databases stored off the device.
[0643] Power is supplied using lithium polymer or AA alkaline batteries.
