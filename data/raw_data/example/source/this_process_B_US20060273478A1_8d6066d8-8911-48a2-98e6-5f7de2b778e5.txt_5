[0062] Then, according to the invention, the mold 110 is removed from the lens section 120 to produce a lens (see FIG. 7c). That is, the mold 110 is released from the lens section 120, leaving the lens section 120 on a side of the substrate 125.
[0063] Thereafter, in a repetition of the steps in FIGS. 7a to 7c, a plurality of lens sections 120 are adhered integrally to the substrate 125 to produce a lens array 140 (see a lower part of FIG. 7c). That is, in repetitive processes, polymer 115 is injected into the grooves 110a of the mold 110 and cured by ultraviolet ray to form the lens sections 120; the substrate is adhered integrally to a back side of the lens sections 120 and the mold 110 is released from the lens sections 120. Then the lens sections 120 are adhered to the substrate 125 on the basis of the alignment layer 135 to form the aligned lens array 140.
[0064] Through this process, the invention eliminates needs to correct an uneven lens surface P resulting from polymer contraction and to repeat a replication method. In addition, additional molds with different forms are not required. Consequently, the invention ensures very high productivity and enables manufacture of a high-quality high sag lens.
[0065] FIG. 8 shows a high sag lens 150 obtained by a method of manufacturing a high sag lens 1, 100 of the invention.
[0066] The lens 150 includes lens sections 20, 120 formed by injecting polymer 15, 115 into a mold 10 and curing the polymer 15, 115 by ultraviolet ray; a substrate 25, 125 having the lens sections 20, 120 arranged on the side; and an adhesive layer 30 which adheres the lens sections 20, 120 integrally to the substrate 25, 125. As shown in FIG. 8, the lens sections 20, 120 are arranged on the substrate 25, 125 in a structure of a lens array. The invention is not limited thereto, but a single lens having a lens section formed on a substrate can be manufactured according to the invention.
