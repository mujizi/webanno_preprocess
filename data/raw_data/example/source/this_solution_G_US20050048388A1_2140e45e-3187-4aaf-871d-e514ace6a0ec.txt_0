EXAMPLE 1
[0052] Preparation of Ag Particulates
[0053] 1.25 g (20 mole) of polyoxyethylene, sorbitanmonolaurate (TWEEN20) and 0.07 g of hydrazine were dissolved in water, and to 100 g of this solution, 5 g of an aqueous solution containing 0.04 g of AgNO.sub.3 was slowly added while stirring to obtain Ag particulates with an average diameter of 50 nm.
[0054] Preparation of a Non-magnetic One-constituent Toner
[0055] 90 parts by weight of polyester having an weight-average molecular weight of 100,000,5 parts by weight of carbon black (manufactured by MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL CO.), 2 parts by weight of a charge control agent (manufactured by ORIENTAL CHEMICAL CO.) and 3 parts by weight of a low molecular weight polypropylene wax (manufactured by SANYO CHEMICAL INDUSTRY CO.) were mixed using a HENSCHEL type mixer. Then, the mixture was infused to a biaxial extruder and a melted mixture was extruded at 130.degree. C., and was cooled to coagulate. Then, an untreated toner with a particle diameter of about 8 .mu.m was obtained using a grinding classifier, and the following external additives were added externally to obtain a toner according to an embodiment of the present invention.
