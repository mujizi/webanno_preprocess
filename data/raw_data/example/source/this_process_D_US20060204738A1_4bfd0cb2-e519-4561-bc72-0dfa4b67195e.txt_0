[0169] An advantage of the nanostructured films of the present invention is the ability to promote adhesion of the endo-graft to the aorta wall, and simultaneously promotes endothelial growth into to the endo-graft.
[0170] Of course, high adhesive force and enhanced tissue integration are only important if the coating is also hemocompatible. Hemocompatibility refers to how the device interacts with blood and its constituent elements. The less the nanostructured film is thrombus generating (or clot forming) on its surface, the more suitable it is for uses in aneurysm repair, Hanson S. R. et al. "Blood Coagulation and Blood-Materials Interactions", In: Biomaterials Science--An Introduction to Materials In Medicine, Ratner, B. D. (ed), pp. 193-200, Academic Press, (1996), the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and discloses suitable materials for hemocompatibility. Silicon dioxide (glass) is considered to be highly clot forming, and therefore has poor hemocompatibility. According to the present invention, the van der Waals interactions are relatively independent of the composition of the nanowires, thus allowing for the independent tailoring of the hemocompatibility properties. This provides flexibility in use for a biostable and hemocompatible coating. For aneurysm uses, the coating must be equivalent in hemocompatibility to the currently used Nitinol endo-graft.
[0171] The present invention contemplates coatings of hemocompatible materials known in the art such aspyrolytic carbon and TiO.sub.2 on the nanostructures (nanowires or nanotubes). TiO.sub.2 is preferred in one embodiment. Techniques for coating various materials are known in the art. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), e-beam evaporation or atomic layer deposition are non limiting examples. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a preferred technology for depositing thin conformal layers of material at low temperature. With ALD, complex structures can be coated to create heterostructures. The outer layer is referred as a shell and the overall architecture is referred to as a core-shell architecture, see for example Ferguson J. D., et al. "TiO2 Atomic Layer Deposition on ZrO2 Particles Using Alternating Exposures of TiCl4 and H2O", Applied Surface Science, (226), pp. 393-404, (2004). This process is conformal even when coating structures with very high aspect ratios such as nanowires. This conformality comes from the layer by layer deposition process. To add a shell (herein, a non-limiting example of TiO.sub.2 is set forth) on a nanowire by this method, generally begins by adsorbing a layer of a titanium containing precursor, such as TiCl.sub.4. until the wire structure is substantially saturated with precursor. This exposure to the point of saturation is what makes end coating conformal and pinhole free. After purging the vessel, the next reactive species is introduced. For TiO.sub.2 synthesis this would be H.sub.2O. HCl(g) and TiO.sub.2(s) are end products of this reaction. Again, the step is performed to saturation to ensure conformatility. This cycle can be continued numerous times to attain a TiO.sub.2 film of desired thickness.
[0172] The shape memory of Nitinol is a key property that makes it very amenable for use in medical devices. Cold working--the temperature at which the shape of the metal is fixed--is usually around 500.degree. C. to 650.degree. C. Wire synthesis is done at a temperature above the eutectic point of gold and silicon, between 360.degree. C. and 550.degree. C. Disilane may be used as a silicon precursor to enhance wire growth at lower temperatures approaching the eutectic point of gold and silicon.
[0173] In another embodiment of the present invention, multiple pieces or strips of nanostructured surfaces may be applied to the patient to treat aneurysm thus allowing for overlap and increased positional accuracy.
