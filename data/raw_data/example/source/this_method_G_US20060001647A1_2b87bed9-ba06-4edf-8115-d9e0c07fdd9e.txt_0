[0011] One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for altering or browsing content displayed on a display screen of a hand-held device by a user handling the hand-held device. The method includes capturing a first user image of the user relative to the device. A second user image of the user relative to the device is subsequently captured. A spatial attribute of the first user image is compared with a corresponding spatial attribute of the second user image. Finally, content displayed on the display screen is altered based upon the comparison. In one embodiment, the content displayed on the display screen is altered by zooming, panning, or tilting (i.e., scrolling) the displayed content. In another embodiment, the compared spatial attributes relate to an area of the user image relative to a reference frame. In another embodiment, the spatial attributes relate to a position of the user image (or identifiable feature thereof) relative to a reference frame.
[0012] Another aspect of the present invention relates to a hand-held device for displaying content to a user. The hand-held device includes a housing, a display screen, a camera system, and a processor. The housing maintains the display screen, the camera system, and the processor. In this regard, the camera system includes a lens that is positioned by the housing such that the lens and the display screen face in a similar direction. The processor is electronically connected to the display screen and the camera system. Further, the processor is adapted to prompt the display screen to display content. The processor is further adapted to capture a first image of a user of the hand-held device relative to the hand-held device via the camera system, and determine a spatial attribute of the first user image. Similarly, the processor is adapted to capture a second image of the user relative to the hand-held device and determine a spatial attribute of the second user image otherwise corresponding with the spatial attribute of the first user image. Finally, the processor is adapted to compare the spatial attributes of the first and second images and alter content displayed on the display screen based upon the comparison. With this construction, the hand-held device is capable of, for example, zooming, panning, or tilting the displayed content based upon a comparison of captured images.
[0013] Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of operating a hand-held display device including a display screen. The method includes prompting the display of a fixed cursor on the display screen, a location of the fixed cursor being fixed relative to a border of the display screen. Moving content is displayed on the display screen. To this end, the moving content is selected from the group consisting of zooming, panning, and tilting content. Regardless, the fixed cursor is displayed on the display screen over the moving content. The hand-held device is then operated to position a desired content sub-set at an activation position on the display screen. The activation position is dictated by a location of the fixed cursor. Finally, with the desired content sub-set in the activation position, the hand-held device is prompted to alter the content displayed on the display screen based upon reference to the desired content sub-set. With this methodology, the fixed cursor provides a convenient means for effectuating displayed content changes, such as zooming, linking, etc., while viewing a moving display.
[0014] Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to a hand-held display device including a display screen and a processor. The processor controls displays on the display screen. To this end, the processor is adapted to cause the display screen to display a fixed cursor. A displayed location of the fixed cursor is fixed relative to a border of the display screen. The processor is further adapted to cause the display screen to display moving content under the fixed cursor, whereby the moving content is zooming, panning, and/or tilting content. With this in mind, the processor is adapted to electronically monitor a relationship between the fixed cursor and the moving display content and alter the content displayed on the display screen based upon a content sub-set associated with the fixed cursor upon receiving a prompt to alter the content. With this configuration, the fixed cursor remains stationary relative to the display screen while displayed content is otherwise zoomed, panned, and/or tilted, allowing a user to easily act upon a desired content sub-set via the fixed cursor.
