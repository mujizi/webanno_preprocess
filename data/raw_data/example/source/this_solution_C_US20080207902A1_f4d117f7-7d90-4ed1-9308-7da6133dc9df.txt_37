Example 206
6-(7-carboxy-2-ethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3--(2H)-pyridazinone
[0609]The compound of Example 204 (19.7 mg) was dissolved in ethanol (1.00 mL). To this solution, 1.00 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (0.20 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Subsequently, the solvent was evaporated and the residue was diluted with water. The mixture was then extracted with diethyl ether and diluted hydrochloric acid was added to the aqueous layer to make it acidic. The aqueous layer was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer was then washed with saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (13.5 mg).
