[0866] FIG. 25 of the Unger et al. article lists various polymorphic tubulin assemblies including dimmers, oligomers, rings, spirals, ring crystals, ring fragments, hoops, C-ribbons, sheets, heaped sheets, S-ribbon, an MT/ribbon complex, a double-wall MT, a macrotuble, a curled ring, and a paracrystal. Such polymorphic forms of tubulin may be used as biological material 302 and/or as a reagent in one or more of the processes of FIGS. 7, 8A, and 8B.
[0867] Another article that dealt with "aberrant forms of tubulin" was one by W. Vater et al. on "Tubulin Assembly in the Presence of Calcium Ions and Taxol: Microtubule Bundling and Fomration of Macrotubule-Ring Complexes," Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton 36:76-83 (1997). The abstract of this article disclosed that " . . . assembly in the presence of Ca.sup.2+ and taxol leads to structural aberrations. The kind of aberration depends on the order of addition of taxol and Ca.sup.2+ to tubulin. When taxol was added first, microtubules were formed preferentially. But, these microtubules typically associated with each other by close wall-to-wall alignments or they formed complexes with some C-shaped protofilament ribbons, resulting in microtubule bundles or doublet-and triplet-like microtubule structures, respectively. When Ca.sup.2 was added firt, macrotubules, rings, and ring crystals were the dominant assembly products. Mostly, the macrotubules were also bundled or they enclosed rings in their lumen." Such calcium ions and/or such taxol and/or such aberrant forms of tubulin may be used as biological material 302 and/or as a reagent in one or more of the processes of FIGS. 7, 8A, and 8B.
[0868] At page 77 of the Vater et al. article, tubulin self-assembly is discussed. It is disclosed that "Tubulin, isolated and purified from cell homogenates, is able to self-assemble into MTs in vitro. This process requires certain conditions, among the appropriate concentrations of Mg.sup.2+ ions (Lee and Timaschef, 1977). The cited Lee et al. article, on "In vitro reconstitution of calf brain microtubules: Effects of solution variables", was published in Biochemistry 16:1754-1764. Such magnesium ion and/or such "solution variables" may be used and/or adjusted in one or more of the processes of FIGS. 7, 8A, and 8B.
[0869] The Vater et al. article also discusses the effects of calcium ions, stating that "By contrast, Ca.sup.+, like cold, usually causes MT disassembly leading to ring structures (circular protofilaments) and similar tubuln ologomers (Weisenberg, 1972)." The cited Weisenberg article, on "Microtubule formation in vitro in solutions containing low calcium concentrations," was published in 1972 in Science 177:1104-1105. Such calcium ion and/or such cold may be used in one or more of the processes of FIGS. 7, 8A, and 8B.
[0870] It is also disclosed in the Vater et al. article that ". Ca.sup.2+ ions are able to cause the formation of curled protofilament ribbons and macrotubules . . . ," citing articles by Matsumarua et al, Langord, and Stromberg et al. The Matsumura et al. article, on "Polymorphism of tublin assembly. In vivo formation of sheet, twisted ribbon, and microtubule", was published in 1976 in Biochim. Biophys. Acta 453:162-175. The Langford article, on "In vitro assembly of dogfish brain tubulin in the induction of coiled ribbon polymers by calcium," was published in 1978 in Exp. Cell Res. 111:139-151. The Stromberg et al. article, on "Differences in the effect of Ca.sup.2+ on isolated microtubules from cod and cow brain," was published in 1994 in Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 28:59-68. Such coiled protofilament ribbons and/or such sheet microtubules and/or such twisted ribbon microtubules may be used as biological material 302 and/or as a reagent in one or more of the processes of FIGS. 7, 8A, and 8B.
