[0197]In the first example, it is assumed that time necessary for switching of the switch 310 in the reference-signal control unit 25 and a comparison operation in the voltage comparing unit 252 is sufficiently short and is also sufficiently short compared with time in which a potential of the reference signal Vslop changes 2 LSB (equivalent to time for one clock of the count clock CK0 (in this example, CKdac). However, actually, in some case, the time is not short in this way.
[0198]For example, as shown in FIG. 8A, time equal to or longer than .beta. clocks and shorter than ".beta.+1" clocks of the count clock CKdac (.beta. is referred to as a processing delay clock width); in the figure, .beta.=1) is further necessary until comparison processing at the reference signal Vslop_1 is completed after comparison processing at the reference signal Vslop_2. In this case, in the processing in the first example, the counter unit 254 stores a count value "T+.beta.". In processing for deciding pixel data, since the counter unit 254 outputs "2 (T+.beta.)-1" or 2(T+.beta.) as a final count value, an error occurs.
[0199]To solve this problem, it is sufficient to set, according to the processing delay clock width .beta., the reference signal Vslop_1 high by "1+2.beta." LSB compared with the reference signal Vslop_2 and perform an AD conversion operation in synchronization with a count operation in the counter unit 254 as described below.
[0200]In order to increase a potential of the reference signal Vslop_1 by "1+2.beta." LSB, a circuit configuration corresponding to the increase only has to be adopted. For example, a resistance value of the resistive element 332 provided between the output node 380_2 for the reference signal Vslop_2 and the output node 380_1 for the reference signal Vslop_1 in FIG. 5A only has to be set "1+2.beta." times as large as a resistance value of the resistive element 330 between the output node 380_1 for the reference signal Vslop_1 and the power supply node.
[0201]Specifically, as shown in FIGS. 8B and 8C, and as in the first example, the voltage comparing unit 252 in each of the pixel rows compares, in the beginning of the comparison processing, the reference signal Vslop_2 and the pixel signal voltage Vx.alpha. supplied from the vertical signal line 19 of the pixel row corresponding thereto. At a point when the pixel signal voltage Vx.alpha. and the reference signal Vslop_2 coincide with each other, the voltage comparing unit 252 switches the comparison pulse COMP from the H level to the L level. The counter unit 254 stores a count value T at this point. In the reference-signal control unit 25, the switch 310 in each of the pixel rows switches the reference signal Vslop_2 to the reference signal Vslop_1 when the comparison pulse COMP from the voltage comparing unit 252 in the column is switched to the L level.
