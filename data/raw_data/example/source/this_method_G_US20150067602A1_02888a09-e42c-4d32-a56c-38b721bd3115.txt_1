Typing Characters on a Virtual Keyboard
[0291] Many electronic devices with touch-sensitive surfaces, such as portable multifunction devices with touch screen displays, have graphical user interfaces with displayed virtual keyboards for typing characters for output in, for example, e-mail messages, notepad applications, and search fields. Some methods for entering a character or a sequence of characters (e.g., entering an input into the device that corresponds to a request to output a character or multiple characters) require separate contacts on a touch-sensitive surface for each character entered. However, entering characters with a separate contact for each character entered can be inefficient and time consuming for a user.
[0292] In the embodiments described below, a faster and more efficient method for accurately typing characters on a virtual keyboard is provided where a sequence of characters can be selected with a continuous contact in response to detecting an increase in intensity of the contact while the contact is over keys corresponding to the characters. In some embodiments, detecting a press input that includes a contact with a respective intensity above a respective threshold (e.g., on a device with a touch-sensitive surface configured to detect intensity of contacts) while a contact is over a respective character causes the device to output the respective character. In contrast, detecting a press input with a maximum intensity below the respective threshold causes the device to forgo outputting the respective character. This method streamlines the character typing process by allowing a user to type characters quickly and accurately using a single continuous movement of a contact.
[0293] FIGS. 11A-11T illustrate exemplary user interfaces for typing characters on a virtual keyboard in accordance with some embodiments. The user interfaces in these figures are used to illustrate the processes described below, including the processes in FIGS. 12A-12D. FIGS. 11B-11T include intensity diagrams that show the current intensity of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface relative to a plurality of intensity thresholds including a first intensity threshold (e.g., "IT.sub.L"), a deep press intensity threshold (e.g., "IT.sub.D") and a character output intensity threshold (e.g., "IT.sub.C").
[0294] FIG. 11A illustrates an exemplary user interface displayed on device 300 with touch screen 112 for typing characters on a virtual keyboard 17704 in accordance with some embodiments. As an example, the device displays a notepad application (app) 17702. Letters and/or other characters produced using inputs (gestures, contacts, etc.) are outputted (e.g., displayed) in the notepad within notepad app 17702.
