[0588] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,307, "In the case of balloon dilation catheters 10, creating a catheter body 12 capable of supporting a substrate layer 16 with enhanced surface area can be done by several means known to the art including altering conditions during balloon spinning, doping with appropriate monomers, applying secondary coatings such as polyethylene oxide hydrogel, branched polylysines, or one of the various Starburst..TM.. dendrimers offered by the Aldrich Chemical Company of Milwaukee, Wis."
[0589] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,307, "The most likely materials for the substrate layer 16 in the case of a dilation balloon catheter 10 or similar apparatus are shown in FIGS. 1a-1g, including synthetic or natural polymers such as polyamide, polyester, polyolefin (polypropylene or polyethylene), polyurethane, and latex. For solid support catheter bodies 12, usable plastics might include acrylamides, methacrylates, urethanes, polyvinylchloride, polysulfone, or other materials such as glass or quartz, which are all for the most part derivitizable." In one embodiment, depicted in FIG. 1A, the photosensitive linker is bonded to a plastic container 12.
[0590] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,307, "Referring to the polymers shown in FIGS. 1a-1g, polyamide (nylon) is treated with 3-5M hydrochloric acid to expose amines and carboxyl groups using conventional procedures developed for enzyme coupling to nylon tubing. A further description of this process may be obtained from Inman, D. J. and Homby, W. E., The Iramobilization of Enzymes on Nylon Structures and their Use in Automated Analysis, Biochem. J. 129:255-262 (1972) and Daka, N.J. and Laidler, Flow kinetics of lactate dehydrogenase chemically attached to nylon tubing, K. J., Can. J. Biochem. 56:774-779 (1978). This process will release primary amines and carboxyls. The primary amine group can be used directly, or succinimidyl 4 (p-maleimidophenyl)butyrate (SMBP) can be coupled to the amine function leaving free the maleimide to couple with a sulfhydryl on several of the photolytic linkers 18 described below and acting as an extender 22. If needed, the carboxyl released can also be converted to an amine by first protecting the amines with BOC groups and then coupling a diamine to the carboxyl by means of carbonyl diimidazole (CDI)." The polymeric material 14, and/or the container 12, may comprise or consist essentially of nylon.
[0591] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,307, "Polyester (Dacron.RTM.) can be functionalized using 0.01N NaOH in 10% ethanol to release hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the manner described by Blassberger, D. et al, Chemically Modified Polyesters as Supports for Enzyme Iramobilization: lsocyanide, Acylhydrazine, and Aminoaryl derivatives of Poly(ethylene Terephthalate), Biotechnol. and Bioeng. 20:309-315 (1978). A diamine is added directly to the etched surface using CDI and then reacted with SMBP to yield the same maleimide reacting group to accept the photolytic linker 18." The polymeric material 14, and/or the container 12, may comprise or consist essentially of polyester."
[0592] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,307, "Polystyrene can be modified many ways, however perhaps the most useful process is chloromethylation, as originally described by Merrifield, R. B., Solid Phase Synthesis. I. The Synthesis of a Tetrapeptide, J. Am. Chem Soc. 85:2149-2154 (1963), and later discussed by Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach, pp. 13-23, (IRL Press 1989). The chlorine can be modified to an amine by reaction with anhydrous ammonia." The polymeric material may be comprised of or consist essentially of polystyrene.
