[0011] using the selection result of a selection criterion with a higher priority as a constraint for a selection based on a selection criterion with a lower priority.
[0012] Furthermore, the above object is achieved by a network node for selecting a combining point at which at least two redundant transmission paths are combined to a single transmission path in a transmission network comprising at least two selectable combining points, said network node being arranged to use at least two measurement-based selection criteria with different priorities for selecting said combining point, and to use the selection result of a higher priority selection criterion as a constraint for a selection based on a lower priority selection criterion.
[0013] Accordingly, the combining point location is optimized based on a goal functionality, e.g. a preemptive method, which works in such a fashion that an optimal solution to a highest priority goal is searched and this solution is added as a new constraint for lower priority goals. If the solution for a higher priority goal leads to a single combining point, lower priority goals may not have to be considered. Such a preemptive method is advantageous in that it always results in an optimum value for the highest priority goal. Moreover, only a decision regarding the priority order of the available different goals is required, while no weights have to be determined. Thereby, lower delays for MDC traffic and a more efficient network utilization can be obtained due to the optimized location of the combining point.
[0014] Preferably, the at least two selection criteria comprise a selection criterion applied to measured lengths or loads of the at least two redundant transmission paths and/or the single transmission path. Furthermore, the at least two selection criteria may comprise a selection criterion applied to measured processing loads of the selectable combining points. In particular, the at least two selection criteria may comprise a first criterion of minimizing the maximum length of the at least two redundant transmission paths, a second criterion of minimizing the maximum total length of the at least two redundant transmission paths and the single transmission path, a third criterion of minimizing the maximum traffic load on the at least two redundant transmission paths and the single transmission path, and a fourth criterion of minimizing the processing load of the combining point. The maximum length and maximum total length may be determined by counting hops of said single and redundant transmission paths, respectively. Furthermore, the highest priority may be allocated to the first criterion, the second highest priority to the second criterion, the third highest priority to the third criterion, and the lowest priority to the fourth criterion. The third criterion may be applied by monitoring and updating real time traffic loads using an averaging function, e.g. an exponential averaging function.
[0015] Thus, the role of load measurements, used for measuring both link loads and combining point processing loads, is emphasized in selecting the optimal combining point. This provides the advantage that both link loads and combining processing loads can be balanced by selecting the optimal combining point.
