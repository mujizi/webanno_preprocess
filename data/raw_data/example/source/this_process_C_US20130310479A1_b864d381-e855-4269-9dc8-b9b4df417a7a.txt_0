[0002] Disclosed are digital offset printing ink compositions and methods for their preparation. Digital offset printing can be used to produce a composite image, which is made up of a number of component images, where each image is formed from a different ink. This is known in normal color printing processes, such as when printing CMYK images. In CMYK color printing, the number of images is four--i.e. a final image is made up of four component images, being formed from C (cyan), M (magenta), Y (yellow) and K (black) inks respectively.
[0003] In such a digital offset printing method, the image is transferred to an intermediate transfer module, e.g., a printing plate or rotating drum under the influence of a holding force to ensure that the image is efficiently transferred and held on the intermediate transfer module. In other embodiments chemical forces or other suitable forces may be used, such as the case when a fountain solution is employed. The force is sufficiently strong to allow accurate accumulation of the image on the intermediate transfer module. The force also is strong enough to ensure that the image is completely transferred from the first surface of the drum, leaving it clean to enable subsequent re-use of the first surface immediately for provision of a subsequent component image to be printed. The transfer module can be a rubber blanket, or a silicone surface on a rotating drum.
[0004] Conventional digital offset printing methods, such as CMYK color offset printing methods usually transfer one component image at a time onto the intermediate transfer module, e.g. the cyan ink component image is first transferred from the first surface to the intermediate transfer module, before being transferred to a substrate (such as a piece of paper) which will bear the final, composite image, before a magenta ink component image is transferred to the intermediate transfer module and then to the piece of paper and similarly followed by the yellow and black inks separately and in turn. This process is called "four shot" since there are four separate transfers from the intermediate transfer module to the substrate.
[0005] In part of other CMYK color digital offset printing processes, there is a process that enables accumulation of all four component inks (C, M, Y and K) on the intermediate transfer module and then to transfer all of the component images at once from the intermediate transfer module to the substrate (i.e. sheet of paper). The images are transferred one at a time onto the intermediate transfer module, where they are accumulated until the component images have been built up--in a superimposed manner. This process is known as "one shot" since all layers of the composite image are transferred at once to the substrate. Accumulating and transferring four superimposed component images at once is a very intensive process and can reduce the lifetime of the intermediate transfer module. Also, the intermediate transfer module and/or the substrate (e.g. sheet of paper) in such intensive processes often need(s) some prior treatment to be able to receive all four inks at once. This treatment can be in the form of applying a coating to the intermediate transfer module or piece of paper. Some of these problems are caused by complications associated with drying of the composite image on the substrate when all four superimposed inks have been transferred simultaneously. Many of these complications can be solved by the use of a UV curable ink that is not a gelling ink.
[0006] For example, a digital offset printing process is known that involves the transfer of a pigmented UV Curable ink onto a silicone printing plate that has been partially coated with a release agent, called a fountain solution, e.g. Novec 7500, commercially available from 3M, Minneapolis, Minn. The ink then can be partially cured using UV light and transferred from the plate to the object, which can be made from paper, plastic or metal, as the case may be. The ink on the object then can be exposed again to UV light for final curing of the ink.
