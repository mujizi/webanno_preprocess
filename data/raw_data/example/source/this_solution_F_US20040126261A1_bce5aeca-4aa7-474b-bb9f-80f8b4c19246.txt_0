[0004] The object underlying the invention is, therefore, to improve a compressor of the generic type in such a manner that the refrigerant drawn in by the scroll compressor is free from lubricating oil to as great an extent as possible.
[0005] This object is accomplished in accordance with the invention, in a compressor of the type described at the outset, in that the refrigerant flows through an oil separator, which is arranged in the outer housing between this and the drive unit, after flowing around the drive motor and prior to entering the scroll compressor.
[0006] The advantage of this solution is to be seen in the fact that a possibility has been created, as a result of this additional oil separator, of separating the oil already carried along with the refrigerant drawn in and also the oil entrained by the refrigerant whilst flowing through the drive motor to a sufficiently large extent prior to it entering the scroll compressor in order to avoid the problems in the scroll compressor caused by oil.
[0007] With respect to as compact a construction of the inventive compressor as possible, it has proven to be advantageous when the oil separator is arranged in a space located between the outer housing and the drive unit in a direction transverse to the central axis since the constructional length, in particular, of the compressor is not altered as a result.
[0008] Furthermore, it has proven to be particularly advantageous when the space between the outer housing and the drive unit extends essentially over the entire extension of the drive unit in a direction parallel to the central axis.
