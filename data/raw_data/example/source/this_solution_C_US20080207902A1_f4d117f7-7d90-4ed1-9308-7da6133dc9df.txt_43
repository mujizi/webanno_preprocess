[0756]6-(2-ethyl-4-hydroxy-7-methylsulfonyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)--4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(2H)-pyridazinone
[0758]The compound of Example 219 (100 mg) was dissolved in methylene chloride (5.00 mL). While this solution was kept at 0.degree. C., 65% m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) (132 mg) was added and the solution was stirred for 1 hour. Subsequently, a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated brine and was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=1:2.fwdarw.ethyl acetate). The product was further purified by amino-silica gel column chromatography (methylene chloride) to afford 7-sulfoxide form, 3-hydroxy-7-sulfoxide form, 7-sulfone form and 3-hydroxy-7-sulfone form as a yellow powder (79.1 mg), reddish orange powder (26.5 mg), yellow oil (13.0 mg) and reddish orange powder (3.00 mg), respectively.
