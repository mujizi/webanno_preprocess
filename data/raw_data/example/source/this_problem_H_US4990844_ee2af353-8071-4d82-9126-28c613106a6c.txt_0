This condition is held until current limit is reached, at which time all phase commands from the logic circuit are turned off (this is done by clearing the GATE.sub.- OUT signal 160A (FIG. 8) which turns off all phase commands). As stated above, this is the difference between Mode 1 and Mode 2. When current limit is reached in Mode 2 the odd output phase command is switched to the same state as the other (instead of turning them all off). This current limit condition is latched, so even if the drive current decreases so as to come out of current limit, the phase commands will remain in this current limit state.
This current limit latch 140 is cleared by clearing the DC.sub.- BRAKE input and setting the DC.sub.- BRAKE.sub.- START input to the logic circuits (FIG. 7). This clear command is executed at a predefined frequency so that the switching of the phase commands occurs at this predefined rate. After this clear command is executed the output phase commands return to the previous state in which two phases are the same and one is opposite.
Usually Mode 1 operation continues for a user defined number of switching periods at which time MODE 2 is entered. This is done by setting the DC.sub.- BRAKE command and clearing the DC.sub.- BRAKE.sub.- START command. There is an exception to the above sequence that occurs at low speeds. Mode 1 is not needed at low speeds and causes undesired "backup" when the apparatus starts DC braking. To avoid this problem Mode 1 is disabled if DC braking is entered below a user-preselected speed.
In addition to the above sequence of events the current limit setting is adjusted, 62b, FIG. 3. When DC braking is entered, a user-selected current-limit setting is used. The current-limit setting is "ramped up" to the user's preselected setting. This ramping up of the current limit setting has helped to resolve problems where the DC bus has overcharged in Mode 1 .
Then, at a user-defined time after DC braking started, another user-selected current limit setting is used. The first current-limit setting is used as a STOPPING limit while the second setting is a HOLDING limit. The STOPPING limit is set to give additional stopping torque, which in turn causes greater motor heating. Then the HOLDING limit is set to give sufficient current to hold the drive without the undesirable excessive heating of the motor.
