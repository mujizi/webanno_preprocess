[0188] Tenth Embodiment
[0189] Referring to FIG. 15, another method for making an openable and re-closable container having the contents stored therein will be discussed hereinafter.
[0190] In this method, preparing of an empty container 10a that is substantially similar to that of FIGS. 13 and 14 and has a pouring-opening 40 is initially performed. Thereafter, the openable section 20 and the communicating section 22 are folded over the storage section 18 at an angle of about 180 degrees relative to the storage section at the recessed portions 52 in such a manner that a surface of one of opposite wall portions including the first and second opposite wall regions come into contact with a surface of one of the third opposite wall regions, whereby the storage section 18 is closed at the side of the storage section 18 that is adjacent to the communicating section 22, the seal sheets 28a, 28b are pressed against each other, and the opposite surfaces of the sealing portions 32 are brought to a protected condition.
[0191] Pouring of a concentrated liquid 34 into the storage section 18 is then carried out in a condition where the folded empty container 10a is turned in such a manner that the pouring-opening 40 is located at the upper position. More particularly, the pouring of the concentrated liquid 34 into the storage section 18 is performed by causing the nozzle 44a of the filler 44 to be inserted into the pouring-opening 40. At this time, the concentrated liquid stored within the storage section 18 does not contact the sealing portions 32 of the seal sheets 28a, 28b. The pouring-opening 40 is finally sealed after the pouring of the concentrated liquid is completed, whereby a finished container is produced.
[0192] Incidentally, maintaining of the container in the folded condition may be performed by inserting the opposite wall portions including the first and second opposite wall regions into a space between the belt-like stopper 54 and the surface of the storage section 18, and causing the nicks 56 to be engaged with an edge region of the belt-like stopper 54. However, the maintaining of the container in the folded condition may be performed utilizing any suitable damper means.
