[0016] For this reason, one challenge when designing a heat sink for use with a converter assembly has been to provide essentially identical heat dissipating capacity to each converter switching device so that device temperatures are essentially identical during system operation. The problem here is that coolant temperature rises as the coolant absorbs heat along its path through a sink member so that power switching devices relatively near an inlet port along a serpentine coolant path are cooled to a greater degree than switching devices down stream from the inlet port. One solution that reduces the heat dissipating capacity differential between similar switching devices has been to provide a heat sink where the spacing between a cooling liquid inlet and each of the sink surfaces to which switching devices are mounted is similar. For instance, where a configuration includes twenty four power switching devices, instead of mounting the switching devices to the sink in a pattern that tracks a single serpentine cooling conduit path, the switching devices may be mounted on sink member mounting surface to form six rows of four switching devices each where each of the six rows is fed by a separate one of six liquid coolant inlet ports--here a manifold may serve each of the six inlet ports (see generally FIG. 23 in U.S. Pat. No. 6,031,751 (hereinafter "the '751 patent") entitled "Small Volume Heat Sink/Electronic Assembly" which issued on Feb. 29, 2000 and which is incorporated herein by reference). Thus, in this case, coolant from each of the six inlet ports passes by four separate heat generating devices and device cooling will be relatively more uniform. This solution to reduce the device temperature differential will be referred to hereinafter as a matrix spacing solution.
[0017] One other solution that reduces the heat dissipating capacity differential between switching devices mounted to a sink member has been to provide a serpentine path that passes by each heat generating device more than once so that the overall cooling affect of devices is similar. For instance, assume twelve switching devices are mounted to a sink member mounting surface to form two rows of six devices each and that a single serpentine path is configured to include a first linear run that passes adjacent the first row of devices, a first 180 degree turn, a second linear run that passes adjacent the second row of devices, a second 180 degree turn, a third linear run that again passes adjacent the second row of devices, a third 180 degree turn and a fourth linear run that passes a second time by the first row of devices to an outlet.
[0018] Here, in theory, the first linear run should include the coolest coolant, the second linear run should include the second coolest coolant and so on so that the coolant temperatures through the first and fourth linear runs (i.e., adjacent the devices in the first row) should average and the coolant temperatures though the second and third linear runs (i.e., adjacent the devices in the second row) should also average and the two average temperatures should be similar (see generally FIG. 2 in the '751 patent). This solution to reduce the device temperature differential will be referred to hereinafter as an averaging solution.
[0019] While the averaging solution and the matrix spacing solution work in theory, in reality, each of these solutions have had some problems regarding temperature differential. With respect to the matrix spacing solution, in the example above, the fourth device along each of the six separate coolant paths is warmer than the first device along the same path as liquid passing by the first three devices along the path heats up when heat is absorbed along the path. Thus, while better than sinks that align devices along a single serpentine cooling conduit path, the matrix solution still results in a temperature differential.
[0020] With respect to the averaging solution, it has been determined that, despite multi-pass designs, at least some temperature differential still exists between devices spaced at different locations along the coolant conduit path. In addition, in some cases, cooling capacity may vary over the heat dissipating surface of each heat generating device. This intra-device dissipating differential may occur as a multi pass path necessarily requires that the coolest pass (i.e., the first pass by a device) be positioned along one side of a dissipating surface so that another one or more passes that include relatively warmer coolant can be positioned along the other side of the dissipating surface.
