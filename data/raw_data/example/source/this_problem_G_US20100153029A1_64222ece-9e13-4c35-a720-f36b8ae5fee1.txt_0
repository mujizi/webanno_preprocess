[0010] Instead, to achieve such sampling resolutions with affordable digital electronics, an aliasing sampling system may be employed as disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 12/243,511 entitled "System and Method for Accurately Measuring Fluid Level in a Tank." In such an aliasing sampling system, the interrogation pulse is transmitted in cyclical fashion at a frequency on the order of 1 MHz, for example, and a swept phase shift or delay is introduced between the time that the interrogation pulse is transmitted and the time that a sample is captured. In this way, with times on the order of one microsecond between successive 1 MHz pulses, the electronics have a chance to recover between samples, and the desired resolution can be achieved by sweeping, or incrementally increasing with each successive cycle, the delay (phase shift) between pulse transmission and sample capture. The train of samples captured at times corresponding to the swept increase in phase shift can be said to exhibit aliasing, since the net effect of combining the constant interrogation pulse frequency with the swept sampling frequency is to produce a microsecond-order version of the picosecond-order waveform, the progressively delayed sampling occurring due to the swept phase shift appearing as a "beat frequency" that is slow enough to be captured and processed by the electronics.
[0011] However, even with such techniques, the limitations of economically available electronics still make it impractical conventionally to spatially resolve the height profile of the various layers in which the TDR probe is immersed. Continuing with the example given above, to achieve a spatial resolution on the order of 1 millimeter with a transmission line of length on the order of several meters would require on the order of several thousand samples. These several thousand samples might be collected over the course of several milliseconds if 1 sample were collected at every 1 MHz pulse and each such sample was usable by the digital signal processing electronics. However, to achieve an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, it is found in practice that many raw samples must be averaged together by fast analog filtering electronics to create a single filtered sample that is then collected by the slower digital signal processing electronics. That is, sampling is actually occurring at two levels: raw samples are averaged together by filtering, and the filtered samples are then being collected by the digital electronics. Allowing time for filtering to be carried out between the samples collected by the digital electronics results in times on the order of 500 microseconds between successive filtered samples. This being the case, at 500 microseconds per sample, several thousand samples would take on the order of several seconds to collect. Such slow response times are unacceptable for many applications.
[0012] Furthermore, this problem of slow response time and inefficient use of processing capacity is made even worse in situations where there are significant lengths of cable or other such transmission line medium between digital signal processing electronics and TDR probe(s). This may be the case where the digital signal processing electronics are removed by some distance from the probe for safety or for convenience, or so that a single digital signal processing electronics unit can be used with multiple probes located various distances therefrom.
[0013] For this and other reasons, conventional commercial TDR systems have generally been unable to adequately resolve the impedance changes occurring along the length of the TDR probe with a spatial resolution and response time sufficient to obtain a reasonably accurate rendering of the height profile of the various layers in which the TDR probe is immersed within the tank. Several practical TDR systems have therefore been proposed to overcome these difficulties, but conventional TDR systems for measuring liquid level within a tank still suffer from problems such as inadequate resolution, slow response time, and sensitivity to variation in dielectric constant and/or temperature.
[0014] For example, as disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 12/243,511 entitled "System and Method for Accurately Measuring Fluid Level in a Tank," a time-of-flight-based technique has been proposed where it has not been possible to reliably detect an air-liquid interface or liquid-liquid interface at the top or bottom of a liquid layer is to determine liquid layer height based not on locations of such interfaces but on the amount by which propagation of the interrogation pulse and its reflection from an easily detectable impedance transition (such as the bottom of an electrically open- or short-circuited TDR probe) is delayed as a result of passage through that liquid layer. However, because the pulse reflected from the probe bottom (which is typically in the vicinity of the tank bottom) must necessarily pass through the liquid layer being measured, such measurements based on the time of flight of the pulse reflected from the probe bottom are susceptible to variations in the temperature and dielectric constant of that liquid layer.
