[0725] This multiplicity of data will indicate which target protein the drug is most efficiently bound to the candidate drug, and which target protein is least efficiently bound to the target drug. The least efficiently bound target proteins are those proteins that, through natural selection of cells, might cause drug resistance to the candidate drug. Thus, in step 210, the data from repeated runs of process 260 is evaluated to determine which of the target proteins are least likely to bind to the candidate drug.
[0726] In step 212, the candidate drug is modified, and the modified drug is then tested again in the cyle of steps 202/204/206/208 to determine its binding efficiency with each of the target proteins initially evaluated as well as other modified target proteins.
[0727] This process may lead to other modified candidate drugs. The goal is to test for, and determine, the existence of a modified drug that has a high binding efficiency for all of the targeted protein structures.
[0728] As will be apparent, the process depicted in FIG. 3 may be used to determine drugs that may minimize drug resistance to anti-mitotic agents; and these "modified drugs" may be used either by themselves and/or in combination with the original cancer drug, depending upon the relative binding efficiencies with regard to particular target proteins and the extent to which the use of such drugs results in synergy. As will also be apparent, the process depicted in FIG. 3 may be used to determine drugs that may minimize other drug resistance caused by natural selection, such as antibiotic drug resistance. The process may also be used in cases of herbicide resistance, pesticide resistance, resistance to antiviral drugs, etc.
[0729] FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of one particular process 220 involving the design of anti-mitotic drugs and, in one embodiment thereof, combinations of antimitotic drugs. Referring to FIG. 4, and in step 222 thereof, the mutant proteins that are resistant to certain anti-mitotic agents are identified. These mutant proteins can be identified by conventional means such as, e.g., those means described hereinbelow, which relate to the identification of mutant tubulin isotypes.
