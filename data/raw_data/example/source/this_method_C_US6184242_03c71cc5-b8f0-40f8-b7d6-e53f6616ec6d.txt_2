A compound of formula Ic' is prepared by reacting a 4,4'-methylenedianiline 12 with a sulfonylating agent such as a sulfonyl halide, and utilizing the reaction conditions described above in step 6, and performing an acid-base extraction with a hydroxide and a mineral acid.
Optionally, a compound of formula Ic can be prepared by further alkylating the compound of formula Ic' with a suitable alkylating agent in the presence of a strong base such as potassium tert-butoxide. Suitable solvents include aprotic organic solvents such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the like, preferably dimethyl sulfoxide.
Exemplary preparations of compounds of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compounds of formulae Ic' and Ic are described in detail in Examples 6-9.
