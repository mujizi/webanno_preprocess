Example 66
3-chloro-2-ethyl-4-hydroxy-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0300]The compound of Example 65 (3.07 g) was dissolved in dichloromethane (40 mL) in an argon atmosphere. While this solution was kept at 0.degree. C., borane tribromide (17.6 mL, 1.0 mol/mL dichloromethane solution) was added and the mixture was stirred for 26 hours at 0.degree. C. to reflux temperature. Subsequently, the reaction was terminated by adding water and the mixture was extracted three times with ethylacetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the title compound as a yellow powder (2.91 g).
