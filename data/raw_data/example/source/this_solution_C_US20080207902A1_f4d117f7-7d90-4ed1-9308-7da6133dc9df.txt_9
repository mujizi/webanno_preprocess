2-ethyl-4-methoxy-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0272]The compound of Example 38 (2.8 g) was dissolved in ethanol (30 mL). To this solution, water (30 mL) and potassium hydroxide (3.35 g) were added and the mixture was stirred for 1.5 hours under reflux. Subsequently, the solvent was partially removed under reduced pressure, followed by addition of a copious amount of water and concentrated hydrochloric acid to make the mixture acidic. The mixture was then extracted three times with ethyl acetate and the organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the resulting white solid was dissolved in ethanol (75 mL). Concentrated sulfuric acid (1.5 mL) was then added and the mixture was stirred for 4 hours under reflux. Subsequently, the solvent was partially removed under reduced pressure and the residue was extracted three times with ethylacetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure afforded the title compound as a gray oil (2.07 g) (Process E).
