In the prior art, blade outer air seals (or, BOAS) have been proposed to limit the blade tip gap formed between the blade tip and the outer shroud. The outer shroud seal is formed from a plurality of arcuate shroud segments forming an annular arranged on the stator assembly that encircles the rotor blades. Thermal barrier coatings (TBC) have also been added to the shroud segment surfaces to limit thermal damage to the BOAS since the hot gas flow leakage will affect the blade tip and the shroud segment material.
One problem found with arcuate shroud segments that have a TBC applied thereto is the stresses developed between the TBC and the substrate on which the TBC is applied. When the engine is cold, no stress is developed between the TBC and the substrate of the arcuate shroud segment because the TBC was applied in the cold condition. When the engine is operating and the shroud segments reach normal operating temperatures, the shroud segments tend to bend due to thermal growth. Mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion between the TBC and the shroud segment will induce high stresses between the materials and cause spalling of the TBC.
One prior art reference that attempts to address this problem is U.S. Pat. No. 5,375,973 issued to Sloop et al on Dec. 27, 1994 entitled TURBINE BLADE OUTER AIR SEAL WITH OPTIMIZED COOLING in which the BOAS shroud segment includes first and second groups of cooling passages each with a cooling air supply orifice to supply cooling air from the casing cavity, one or more re-supply holes connecting the cooling passages to the cavity to re-supply cooling air, and cross supply orifices connecting adjacent cooling passages to provide for cross flow of cooling air between the cooling passages in the event that the flow within a particular passage shroud decrease, as in the case where the metering orifice of a cooling passage is partially obstructed by a foreign object (see column 6, lines 25-34 in the Sloop et al patent). The Sloop et al patent provides improved BOAS cooling over the cited prior art. However, the present invention improves over the Sloop et al cooling design by providing for multi-metering diffusion compartment cooling to provide improved cooling using less cooling air.
The present invention is a blade outer air seal (BOAS) used in a gas turbine engine in which the shroud segments include multi-metering diffusion compartments for cooling the BOAS and a float wall mechanism for the entire blade outer air seal. The BOAS shroud segment includes a plurality of diffusion cavities extending in a direction to the hot gas flow path each with metering holes to meter cooling air from the blade ring carrier. Each diffusion cavity is connected to a plurality of cooling channels also extending along the direction of the flow path. The TBC is applied to the outer surface of the shroud segment with a wire mesh to limit spalling. The combined effect of both mechanisms greatly reduces the BOAS main body metal temperature and improves the durability of the thermal barrier coating (TBC) which results in a reduction of cooling flow requirement, improves the turbine stage performance, and prolongs the BOAS life.
