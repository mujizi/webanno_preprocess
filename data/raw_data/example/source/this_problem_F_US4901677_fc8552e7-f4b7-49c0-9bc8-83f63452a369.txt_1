DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
FIG. 1A illustrates an important problem in gas-to-liquid heat exchangers formed by coiling finned tubing 102. As indicated, the hot-gas stream tends to flow directly through the gap between tube rows. As a result, a large fraction of the external surface area of the finned tubes is ineffective in transferring heat because of the low gas velocity over this surface area. As shown in FIG. 1B, a practical method of alleviating this problem is to wrap a baffle 104 around the coil between adjacent tube rows 102. The baffle directs the hot gas stream so that it flows at high velocity over a greater portion of the external surface area resulting in a significant increase in heat transfer effectiveness.
A finned-tube gas-to-liquid heat exchanger consisting of a gas-fired hydronic boiler embodying the present invention is shown in FIG. 2. The liquid heating coil 10 comprises finned tubing wound in a helical coil, such that the fin tips of adjacent turns are touching or nearly touching. Unfinned tubing 12 is wrapped around the finned-tube coil 10 such that it nests tightly in the span between adjacent turns and contacts the fin tips of the adjacent turns. The liquid to be heated enters through an inlet manifold 14 and flows through both the finned tube coil 10 and the unfinned coil 12. The orifice 16 is sized to provide a balancing flow resistance to proportion the incoming liquid flow between the two coils so that equal temperature rise occurs in each of the two parallel paths. The two streams of heated liquid join in the outlet manifold 18. The finned-tube coil 10 and unfinned-tube coil 12 are contained within a housing 20 which is constructed of heat resistant material. A burner 22 is mounted in an upper opening of the housing 20 to receive air and gas mixture from a combustion blower (not shown in FIG. 2). Burner 22 preferably consists of a perforated sheetmetal flameholder. the coil 10 is enclosed by the upper refractory insulation cap 24 and the lower insulating baffle 28. In operation, air and gas supplied by the combustion blower enter burner flameholder 22 and burn in the space between flameholder 22 and coil 10. The hot products of combustion flow in between the fins of coil 10. The unfinned coil 12 acts as a baffle forcing the hot-gas stream to flow at a high velocity over a greater portion of the surface of the finned tube coil 10 thereby increasing the heat transfer effectiveness. Since the unfinned tube coil 12 is cooled by the liquid flowing through it, its temperature remains close to that of the finned tubing during operation. As a result, there is little if any differential thermal expansion and the baffle remains in contact with the finned-tube coil. An additional advantage is that the circular shape of the finned tubing makes it easier to nest tightly between coil rows and improves its effectiveness as a baffle in increasing the average gas-side heat transfer coefficient. Another advantage is that the unfinned-tubing coil 12 provides additional heat transfer area which further increases the effectiveness of the heat exchanger. The application of this invention will increase the achievable heat-transfer effectiveness of finned-tube heat exchanger coils and will help insure that the effectiveness does not deteriorate over the life of the system.
The preferred embodiment of the invention provides parallel flow of liquid through the finned tubing and the unfinned tubing. This assures a minimum temperature differential between the tubes. However, the liquid may flow in series through the tubes in some applications.
