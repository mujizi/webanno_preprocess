[0061] The schematic diagram of FIG. 7 shows an imaging apparatus 100 for 2-D imaging, such as panoramic imaging, in which a succession of two or more 2-D images is obtained and images of adjacent content are arranged to form a larger image, or for 3-D imaging, such as tomography, computed tomography volume imaging, or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging in dental, ENT, and related head imaging applications. A rotatable mount 130 is provided on a column 118, preferably adjustable in height to suit the size of patient 12. Mount 130 maintains x-ray source 110 and a radiation sensor 121 on opposite sides of the head of patient 12 and, optionally, rotates to orbit source 110 and sensor 121 in a scan pattern about the head, obtaining a projection image at each angle in a set of projection angles. Mount 130 rotates about an axis Q that corresponds to a central portion of the patient's head, so that its attached components orbit about the head. Sensor 121, a photon-counting sensor according to an embodiment of the present invention, is coupled to mount 130, opposite x-ray source 110 that emits a radiation pattern suitable for 2-D imaging, for tomosynthesis imaging, or for CT or CBCT volume imaging. An optional head support 136, such as a chin rest or bite element, provides stabilization of the patient's head during image acquisition. A computer 106 has an operator interface 104 and a display 108 for accepting operator commands and for display of volume images obtained by imaging apparatus 100. Computer 106 is in signal communication with sensor 121 for obtaining image data and provides signals for control of source 110 and, optionally, for control of a rotational actuator 112 for mount 130 components. One or more height sensors 134 is also sensed by computer 106 in order to obtain an initial height setting and to track relative vertical displacement of the sensor 121 relative to the patient's head during the helical scan. Computer 106 is also in signal communication with a memory 132 for storing image data. An optional alignment apparatus 140 is provided to assist in proper alignment of the patient's head for the imaging process. Alignment apparatus 140 includes a laser that provides one or more line references for head positioning according to an embodiment of the present invention. In alternate embodiments, alignment apparatus 140 includes a visible light beam or other marker, or a mechanical or other positioning apparatus. Imaging apparatus 100 may also have the capability for panoramic or cephalometric imaging using x-ray source 110 and sensor 121 or other imaging sensor.
[0062] There can be a number of variable scan patterns according to the type of imaging that is required. Tomosynthesis, for example, typically uses a scan that is less than 180 degrees about the patient. CBCT scanning may require a helical scan pattern with one or more revolutions about the patient's head. An optional adjustment mechanism 142 is provided for adjusting the source-to-image (SID) distance between the x-ray source 110 and sensor 121 to suit the scan pattern for different patients or types of imaging.
[0063] One drawback of typical photon-counting image detectors is their relatively small size. Unlike a conventional digital radiography imaging panel that has an array with hundreds of elements in the height and width directions, the photon-counting sensor is typically of smaller size, with a width that may be fewer than 100 pixels in dimension. This problem can be addressed by tiling, an approach in which multiple image detectors are combined to cover a larger detection area. The use of polycrystalline materials, as opposed to conventional monocrystalline detector materials as noted earlier, can also help to provide larger detectors.
[0064] Another solution for the size constraints of photon-counting image detectors adapts their scanning sequence to effectively increase the field of view. In practice, this size limitation requires a different scanning sequence from that used for conventional CBCT imaging. A helical scan can be used to acquire the needed image data for volume imaging. In operation, mount 130 rotates about the head of patient 12 multiple times, thereby scanning sensor 121 about patient 12 in a helical orbit, as is shown in FIG. 8. In FIG. 8, an adjacent imaging position is shown in dotted outline, with the angular distance exaggerated for clarity. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the vertical height h change of the helix during revolution of the source and detector, which can also be expressed in terms of the helical pitch angle P, and angular change .theta. between successive image acquisitions, is adjustable.
[0065] The helical scan needed for CBCT imaging using a photon-counting sensor 121 can be provided following either of a number of scanning apparatus models. FIGS. 9A and 9B show a first approach to this problem, in which mount 130 that contains sensor 121 and source 110 is itself coupled to a movable travel arm 128 that is vertically translated during the scan, displaced by an actuator 122 during rotation of mount 130. This translation changes the relative vertical position of the imaging sensor and the radiation source to the patient's head during the helical scan. In one embodiment for the helical scan, an imaging sensor can be a slit shaped sensor with the longest dimension configured to extend during the scan in a direction that is perpendicular to the helix axis.
