The scoured T-shirt described above was immersed in this aqueous solution and gradually heated to 70.degree. C., at which temperature it was treated for 15 minutes.
Subsequently, the T-shirt was thoroughly rinsed with water to remove the unfixed portion of the cationic compound and other additives, followed by dehydration.
Next, 2400 parts of water and 50 parts of a dispersion containing the thermochromic microcapsules obtained in Preparation Example 1 were added to this vat, and this solution was gradually heated to 80.degree. C., at which temperature it was treated for 15 minutes.
This dispersion was pink before treatment, but it became a transparent colorless liquid after treatment (observation was made at 25.degree. C.). This finding demonstrates that the thermochromic microcapsules was completely exhausted into the cotton T-shirt.
Subsequently, this T-shirt was thoroughly rinsed and dehydrated, after which it was allowed to dry and then subjected to heat treatment at 140.degree. C. in a tumbler drier for 1 minute.
