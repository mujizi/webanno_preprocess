[0186] Virus neutralization assays are useful for detection of antibodies that not only specifically bind to the pathogen, but also neutralize the function of the virus. These assays are typically based on detection of antibodies in the sera of immunized animal and analysis of these antibodies for their capacity to inhibit viral growth in tissue culture cells. Such assays are known to those skilled in the art. One example of a virus neutralization assay is described by Dolin R (J. Infect. Dis. 1995, 172:1175-83). Virus neutralization assays provide means to screen for antigens that also provide protective immunity.
[0187] In some embodiments, shuffled antigens are screened for their capacity to induce T cell activation in vivo. More specifically, peripheral blood mononuclear cells or spleen cells from injected mice can be isolated and the capacity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to lyse infected, autologous target cells is studied. The spleen cells can be reactivated with the specific antigen in vitro. In addition, T helper cell activation and differentiation is analyzed by measuring cell proliferation or production of T.sub.H1 (IL-2 and IFN-.gamma.) and T.sub.H2 (IL-4 and IL-5) cytokines by ELISA and directly in CD4.sup.+ T cells by cytoplasmic cytokine staining and flow cytometry. Based on the cytokine production profile, one can also screen for alterations in the capacity of the antigens to direct T.sub.H1/TH.sup.2 differentiation (as evidenced, for example, by changes in ratios of IL-4/IFN-.gamma., IL-4/IL-2, IL-5/IFN-.gamma., IL-5/IL-2, IL-13/IFN-.gamma., IL-13/IL-2). The analysis of the T cell activation induced by the antigen variants is a very useful screening method, because potent activation of specific T cells in vivo correlates to induction of protective immunity.
[0188] The frequency of antigen-specific CD8.sup.+ T cells in vivo can also be directly analyzed using tetramers of MHC class I molecules expressing specific peptides derived from the corresponding pathogen antigens (Ogg and McMichael, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998, 10:393-6; Altman et al., Science 1996, 274:94-6). The binding of the tetramers can be detected using flow cytometry, and will provide information about the efficacy of the shuffled antigens to induce activation of specific T cells. For example, flow cytometry and tetramer stainings provide an efficient method of identifying T cells that are specific to a given antigen or peptide. Another method involves panning using plates coated with tetramers with the specific peptides. This method allows large numbers of cells to be handled in a short time, but the method only selects for highest expression levels. The higher the frequency of antigen-specific T cells in vivo is, the more efficient the immunization has been, enabling identification of the antigen variants that have the most potent capacity to induce protective immune responses. These studies are particularly useful when conducted in monkeys, or other primates, because the MHC class I molecules of humans mimic those of other primates more closely than those of mice.
[0189] Measurement of the activation of antigen presenting cells (APC) in response to immunization by antigen variants is another useful screening method. Induction of APC activation can be detected based on changes in surface expression levels of activation antigens, such as B7-1 (CD80), B7-2 (CD86), MHC class I and II, CD14, CD23, and Fc receptors, and the like.
[0190] Shuffled cancer antigens that induce cytotoxic T cells that have the capacity to kill cancer cells can be identified by measuring the capacity of T cells derived from immunized animals to kill cancer cells in vitro. Typically the cancer cells are first labeled with radioactive isotopes and the release of radioactivity is an indication of tumor cell killing after incubation in the presence of T cells from immunized animals. Such cytotoxicity assays are known in the art.
