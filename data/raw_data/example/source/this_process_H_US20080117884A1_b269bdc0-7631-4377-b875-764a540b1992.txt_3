[0296]In response to the secondary PDP information activate request 2402, the mobile network packet gateway 170 generates secondary PDP information concerning the terminal 101c in the mobile network packet gateway 107. FIG. 20 shows secondary PDP information fields. The secondary PDP information corresponds to Secondary PDP context in GPRS and is used for managing information about terminals.
[0297]Then, the packet controller 106 performs RAB setup 2403 for establishing an RAB (Radio Access Bearer), which is a communication cannel for user data. Here, a process corresponding to RAB Setup Request and RAB Setup Response in RANAP in 3GPP TS 25.413 and RADIO BEARER SETUP and RADIO BEARER SETUP RESPONSE in TS 25.331 is performed.
[0298]After completion of this process, the packet controller 106 performs a secondary PDP information update process 2404 for the mobile network packet gateway 107. As a result, establishment of RAB is reflected in the secondary PDP information concerning the terminal 101c in the mobile network packet gateway 107. After completion of the process, the packet controller 106 sends a PDP information activate response 2405 to the terminal 101c.
[0299]With the completion of the sequence, the connection relating to cell L2 is registered in the UTRAN and the packet controller 106. Since in the present embodiment, packet data is transferred over the wireless LAN network and the mobile network packet gateway 107 is not used for packet relay, the secondary PDP information activate 2402 and the secondary PDP information update 2404 can be omitted.
[0300]Returning to FIG. 15, the terminal 101c performs a process for registering cell M1 as semi-active set (S1509) in order to perform a process for location prediction. After connection relating to the terminal 101c is established, the radio network controller 106 searches a cell position management section 203 for cells adjacent to cell L2. As a result, only cell M1 is retrieved. The radio network controller 106 starts a process for updating the active set in order to register cell M1. While all adjacent cells are included in the semi-active set in this embodiment, only adjacent cells into which the terminal 101c is likely to move may be included in the semi-active cell on the basis of more detailed information about communication conditions.
