[0227] Electrosurgical Systems and Processes
[0228] Electrosurgical systems and processes in various embodiments apply monopolar or bipolar high-frequency electrical energy to a patient during surgery. Such systems and processes are particularly adapted for laparoscopic and endoscopic surgeries, where spatially limited access and visibility call for simple handling, and are used to fuse blood vessels and weld other biological tissue and in one aspect to cut, dissect and separate tissue/vessels. In particular embodiments, the systems and processes include the application of RF energy to mechanically compressed tissue to (a) desiccate the tissue, and (b) to denature collagens (type I-III) and other proteins, which are abundant in most biological tissue. As heating of collagens to an appropriate temperature causes them to unfold, shrink or denature, the system enables the sealing of capillaries and blood vessels during surgery for permanent occlusion of the vessels. As described in greater detail below, as an example, arteries up to seven millimeters can be occluded and dissected by radio frequency (RF) energy and mechanical pressure.
[0229] When concurrently applying controlled high-frequency electrical energy to the compressed tissue, the tissue is compressed with a relatively high pressure (about 10-20 kg/cm2), and the tissue is supplied with sufficient electrical energy to denature proteins and remove sufficient water in the tissue. During this process, the applied voltages are sufficiently reduced to avoid electrical arcing (typically <200V RMS).
[0230] When applying electrical energy in the described manner stated above, the tissue quickly moves through the following fusion/welding process. Starting at body temperature the tissue (a) heats quickly, leading to (b) cell rupture, expelling of juices (mainly water and salt ions), (c) unraveling and "activation" of collagens and elastin in the blood vessels at about 60-650 C, and (d) desiccation of the vessel. Here, the desiccation process can be seen by the release of water in form of steam where the vessel temperature has reached about 1000C. The reduction of water in presence of unraveled collagen and elastin strands leads to formation of bonds between collagen strands, leading to a strong and elastic seal of the tissue. As confirmed by measurements, the strongest (highest burst pressure) vessel fusions are obtained when the vessels have been heated to at least 70.degree. C., pressurized with about 10-20 kg/cm2, and then desiccated by about 40-50% of their original water content.
[0231] Electrically, the tissue can be characterized during the fusion process by its impedance, which is typically starting at 10-100 Ohms purely ohmic resistance. During the fusion process, the purely ohmic resistance reduces by 20-50% before it increases by two orders of magnitude. As the resistance approaches a final value, the impedance of the tissue gradually increases in capacitive behavior with a phase shift of about 20 degrees. The tissue will exhibit a pronounced capacitive behavior at the end of the fusion process with a phase shift of about 40 degrees, even though the ohmic component will remain nearly unchanged during this phase.
