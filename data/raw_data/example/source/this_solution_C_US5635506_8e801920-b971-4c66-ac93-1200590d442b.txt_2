2-[2'-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-10-nitro-1,2-dihydro-3H-dibenz(deh)isoquinoline-1,3-dione (112)
Nitrosylsulfuric acid was prepared by dissolving 165 mg (2.4 mmole) of sodium nitrite in 3 mL of 98% sulfuric acid chilled to 10.degree.-15.degree. C. The mixture was stirred until the sodium nitrite dissolved and then it was added to a vigorously stirred solution at 15.degree. C. of 300 mg (0.9 mmol) of 10-amini-2-[2'-(dimethylamino) ethyl]-1,2-dihydro-3H-dibenz(deh)isoquinoline-1,3-dione in 10 ml of glacial acetic acid. Stirring was continued one hour at 5.degree.-10.degree. C. and then the mixture was diluted with excess diethyl ether. The yellow diazonium disulfate salt that separated was collected by filtration, washed with a mixture of ether and methanol (1:1) and quickly dissolved in 10 mL of water at 5.degree. C. This solution was added in portions to a vigorously stirred 10.degree. C. saturated solution of sodium nitrite containing 300 mg of copper powder. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and then diluted with water. The resulting precipitate was collected, dried well, and extracted with dioxane. Evaporation of this extract gave a yellow-brown solid that was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with chloroform-methanol (9.5:0.5) as solvent. This procedure gave 161 mg (49%) of the title compound with a melting point of 240.degree.-242.degree. C. after recrystallization from toluene containing a little hexane.
