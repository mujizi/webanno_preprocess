Often, a second finish composition may be applied over the first finish composition by simply respreading the coated staple fiber onto the plastic surface, uniformly overspraying the fiber with one half of an aqueous solution or emulsion of the second finish, turning the fiber over, uniformly overspraying the fiber with the remainder of the aqueous solution or emulsion, and drying the coated fiber.
C. Chemical Analysis of Coated Fiber
A portion of the oversprayed staple fiber is analyzed to determine the approximate actual amount of the finish compounds on the fiber, and the remainder of the forty pound samples are evaluated to determine their high speed carding, drawing and open end spinning characteristics. The analysis method uses hot methanol to extract all finish compounds from the staple fiber, by means of a soxhlet extraction apparatus. This method also extracts polyester oligomers from the staple fiber, and a constant level of such oligomers (0.03 weight percent) is assumed. A primary finish level of 0.06 weight percent is also assumed; the remaining extractant is the combination of the oversprayed finish compounds. Since the proportions of these compounds are known, valid estimates of fiber finish levels can be made using this method.
D. High Speed Carding
The coated staple fibers are evaluated for their carding characteristics by feeding the sample fibers to a carding machine operated at from 50 to 55 pounds of staple fiber per hour at an average relative humidity of about 52%. As discussed above, the individual staple fibers are formed into roughly parallel strands (card slivers) which are deposited in circular fashion into a can. Three properties (static electricity, fiber cohesion, and can build-up) are qualitatively evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.
