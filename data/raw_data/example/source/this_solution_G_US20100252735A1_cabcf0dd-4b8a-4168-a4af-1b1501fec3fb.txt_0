[0016] Particular embodiments of the method of the invention are the subject of the dependent claims 2 to 12.
[0017] Another subject of the invention is a system for measuring nanoscale deformations in a portion of a crystal specimen by such a method. Such a system, which is the subject of claim 13, is characterized in that it comprises: a support for a crystal specimen in the form of a wafer with approximately parallel faces; illumination means for illuminating one face of said specimen with a spatially coherent beam of radiation capable of being diffracted by the crystal lattice of the specimen; an optical assembly for superposing a beam of radiation diffracted by a first area of the specimen with a beam of the same radiation diffracted, to the same order, by a second area, coplanar with said first area, so as to cause these two diffracted beams to interfere at a plane called the image plane; a means for measuring the spatial periodicity of the fringes of the resulting interference pattern; and a data processing means for calculating, from said spatial periodicity, a difference in the lattice parameter between said first and second areas of the specimen, which is indicative of a state of deformation of one of these areas relative to the other at the nanoscale.
[0018] Such a system can be produced using a conventional electron microscope. However, this solution is not fully satisfactory, in particular when it is hoped to measure the deformations in a relatively large area of a specimen (several .mu.m.sup.2). Another subject of the invention is therefore an electron optical device, as claimed in claim 14, comprising: a pair of beam-deflecting coils; insertion means for placing a specimen in the path of an electron beam that has passed through said pair of deflecting coils; a first electromagnetic lens for forming an image of said specimen; and a diaphragm positioned in the image focal plane of said first lens and centered on the optical axis of the latter in order to intercept electrons focused by said first lens off said optical axis; and characterized in that said insertion means are designed to allow the positioning of a specimen outside an area of said first electromagnetic lens with a strong magnetic field, upstream of said lens relative to the propagation direction of said electron beam.
[0019] Claims 15 to 25 relate to particular embodiments of such a device.
