In the operation of the system, a retrievable landing assembly is attached to the coupling tool 30 and lowered through the string of casing or tubing on a string of tubing until the setting collar 15 engages the stop or landing seat 13 at which time the locking elements 17 are disposed adjacent to the locking groove 12. The ball 52 is dropped into the tubing string and hydraulic pressure aplied to the tubing string. The hydraulic pressure shifts to the sleeve 20 downwardly so that the shear pin 42 (FIG. 2D) is sheared at a predetermined pressure and the latching elements 17 are extended or moved outwardly by the tapered surface 43 into the locking groove 12. When the latching elements 17 are fully extended, the split ratchet ring 45 has locking teeth which engage the ratchet 46 and retains the sleeve 20 in a downward position with respect to the setting collar 15. A simple pull up on the tubing can determine if the latching elements have indeed latched into locking groove 12.
The tubing attached to the sub 62 is rotated to the right which permits the traveling nut 31 to be rotated with the mandrel 32 relative to the setting collar 15. The nut 31 is rotated out of threaded engagement with the setting collar 15 and the mandrel 32 can be uncoupled from the collar 15 and the tubing extension 35 is slidably and sealingly received in the bore 37. At the same time the setting collar 15 is releasably latched in the packer bore receptacle 10.
Should it become necessary to pull or replace the tubing, the tubing is completely retrievable, as previously described, leaving the PBR 10 still in place. Should it be desired to retrieve the PBR 10 after the tubing is retrieved, a fishing tool or spear 70 is passed into the PBR 10 to engage with the setting sleeve 20. Thereafter, an upward pull on the sleeve 20 shears the shear coupling 22 and the shoulder 25 engages the downwardly facing shoulder on the setting collar 15. The upward movement of the sleeve 20 releases the latching elements 17 from the latching groove 12 and the setting collar is thus removable. In this process the ball 52 and shear ring 26 are previously removed by hydraulic pressure and have dropped to the bottom of the bore.
Should it become necessary to re-enter the lower part of the well the RILA is completely retrievable, as previously described, leaving the full internal bore of the casing open to use workover tools.
While various embodiments are illustrated, the scope of the invention is included within the claims that follow.
