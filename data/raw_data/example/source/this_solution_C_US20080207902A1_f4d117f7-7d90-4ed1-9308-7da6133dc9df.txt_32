7-methoxy-4-propionyl-2-trifluoromethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0465]Using the compound of Example 135, the reaction was carried out as in Example 138 to afford the title compound as a colorless powder.
[0466]The compound of Example 135 (32.1 g) was dissolved in DMSO (780 mL) in an argon atmosphere. To this solution, triethylamine (163 mL) and sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex (93.1 g) were sequentially added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was then poured into ice water and the resulting solid product was collected by filtration. The product was washed with water and dissolved in ethyl acetate. The solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent afforded the title compound as a colorless powder (24.0 g).
