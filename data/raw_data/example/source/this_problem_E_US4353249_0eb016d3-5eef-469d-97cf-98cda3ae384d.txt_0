The particular construction of the packers themselves is not a feature of the present invention. Typical packer constructions may be seen for example in U.S. Pat. No. 3,876,003 issued to Kisling III on Apr. 8, 1975, U.S. Pat. No. 3,565,172 issued to Cole on Feb. 23, 1971 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,439,740 issued to Conover on Apr. 22, 1969. Each of these patents, particularly the first and last patents noted above, discloses packer assemblies of the type contemplated by the present invention.
Various techniques for carrying out flow studies resulting in the determination of permeability values for the surrounding formations are described at length in the prior art, for example, within the Bureau of Mines report referred to above. The use of such packers and the conducting of flow tests within isolated regions or test intervals provides an effective indication of permeability values for the surrounding formation. Past efforts in connection with permeability studies have tended to result only in an overall permeability value for the surrounding formation. However, underground formations are characterized by multi-directional components of permeability which may have a substantial effect on various applications contemplated for the underground formation. For example, flow between the test interval defined or isolated by the packers and the surrounding formation depends in large part upon formation permeability in radial orientation relative to the borehole. The prior art has recognized this to the extent that the test interval formed between the packers has often been extended in order to diminish "end effects" resulting from axial flow, that is, flow parallel to the length of the borehole, at opposite ends of the test interval. Such axial flow may result from permeability within the formation itself as well as from leakage around the packers due to improper sealing of the packer against the borehole walls or from axial striations extending along the borehole walls adjacent the packers. Any of these characteristics may provide an axial flow path permitting some axial fluid flow between the formation and the test interval. Furthermore, such axial fluid flow may bypass the packers so that part of the observed flow passes either from or into the borehole outside the defined test interval. Generally, such conditions, usually termed "end effects," tend to interfere with accurate characterization of permeability for the formation.
Some effort has been made in the prior art to overcome this problem and to characterize formation permeability while cancelling the effect of such axial flow, particularly that caused by packer leakage or striations in the borehole walls. For example, one such effort involved the use of two additional packers arranged in respective spaced-apart relation with the packers forming the test interval. The additional packers thus defined additional cavities at opposite ends of the test interval. According to the prior art, these two additional cavities are then placed in communication with each other, water being injected into the two additional cavities in order to maintain them at the same pressure as that observed within the test interval formed between the two primary packers. The purpose of this four-packer arrangement, with the two additional cavities, was to assure flow of fluid from the central cavity or test interval outwardly in generally radial flow into the surrounding formation. In other words, the above four-packer system was proposed and tested in order to cause flow from the test interval to be controlled by pressurization of the two additional cavities in order to satisfy an assumption of flow only in the radial direction from the central test interval. Similarly, yet another modification contemplated in the prior art was the use of three packers forming two adjacent test intervals or cavities, water being injected into one of the test cavities to provide a source, water being pumped from the other cavity in order to provide a "sink." This technique is not discussed in greater detail herein since it is believed obvious that the following discussion of shortcomings for the above four-packer system also applies to this three-packer system.
Referring again to the four-packer system described above, it was possible to further characterize lateral or radial permeability of the surrounding formation. However, tests of the type contemplated in connection with the four-packer system and in connection with all of the prior art techniques referred to above generally concerned flow rates and permeabilities of a relatively high level. For example, two, three or four-packer systems of the type provided by the prior art are generally very effective in determining permeabilities in the range above 1,000 microdarcies and, at least in some applications, even down toward a level of approximately 100 microdarcies. Measurements of this magnitude are very satisfactory for many applications such as those commonly encountered in permeability studies in connection with oil and gas field technology, in classical hydrology and the like.
However, it is becoming of greater importance to conduct permeability studies in underground formations which are considered as classically impermeable media, or which are of low permeability such as salt formations, shales, hydrites, limestone formations and the like. For example, such underground formations are commonly encountered in the formation of underground storage for nuclear waste materials and in some current applications for solution mining.
