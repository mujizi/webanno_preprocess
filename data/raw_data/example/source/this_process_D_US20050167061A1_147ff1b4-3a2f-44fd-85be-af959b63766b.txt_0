[0078] Advantages of the HPTAD process are in the areas of improved sheet dewatering without a significant loss in sheet quality, compactness in thickness and energy efficency. Additionally, it enables higher pre-Yankee solids, which increase the speed potential of the invention. Further, the compact size of the HPTAD allows easy retrofit to an existing machine. The compact size of the HPTAD and the fact that it is a closed system means that it cam be easily insulated and optimized as a unit to increase energy efficiency.
[0079] Now, additionally referring to FIG. 17, there is shown another embodiment of the present invention. This is significantly similar to FIGS. 13 and 16 except for the addition of a two-pass HPTAD 80. In this case, two vented rolls are used to double the dwell time of structured web 38 relative to the design shown in FIG. 16. An optional air dispersion fabric may used as in the previous embodiment. Hot pressurized air passes through web 38 carried on fabric 28 and onto the two vent rolls. It has been shown that depending on the configuration and size of the HPTAD, that more than one HPTAD can be placed in series, which can eliminate the need for roll 60.
[0080] Now, additionally referring to FIG. 18, a conventional Twin Wire Former 90 may be used to replace the Crescent Former shown in previous examples. The forming roll can be either a solid or open roll. If an open roll is used, care must be taken to prevent significant dewatering through the structured fabric to avoid losing fiber density in the pillow areas. The out forming fabric can be either a standard forming fabric or one such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,237,644. The inner forming fabric 91 is a structured fabric 91 that is much coarser than the outer forming fabric. Web 38 is transferred to structured fabric 28 using a vacuum device. The transfer can be a stationary vacuum shoe or a vacuum assisted rotating pick-up roll. The second structured fabric 28 is at least the same coarseness and preferably courser than first structured fabric 91. The process from this point is the same as one of the previously discussed processes. The registration of the web from the first structured fabric to the second structured fabric is not perfect, as such some pillows will be pressed, losing some of the benefit of the present invention. However, this process option allows for running a differential speed transfer, which has been shown to improve some sheet properties. Any of the arrangements for removing water discussed above and a conventional TAD 92 may be used with the Twin Wire Former arrangement.
[0081] Fabric 26 may be uniformly permeable or have a pattern of non-permeable portions, which serve to enhance a pattern in web 38. The depth of the patterns can be adjusted differently for different tissue products. Pattern portions are also referred to as having zones of differing permeability.
[0082] The fiber density distribution of web 38 in this invention is opposite that of the prior art, which is a result of removing moisture through the forming fabric and not through the structured fabric. This allows a high percentage of the fibers to remain uncompressed during the process. The sheet absorbency capacity as measured by the basket method, for a nominal 20 gsm web is equal to or greater than 12 grams of water per gram of fiber and often exceeds 15 grams of water per gram fiber. The sheet bulk is equal to or greater than 10 cm.sup.3/gm and preferably greater than 13 cm.sup.3/gm. The sheet bulk of toilet tissue is expected to be equal to or greater than 13 cm.sup.3/gm before calendering.
