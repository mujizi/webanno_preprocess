[0006] As stated above, one reason for monitoring the vertical propagation of a fracture is the concern for fracturing outside of a defined hydrocarbon-producing zone into an adjacent water-producing zone. When this occurs, water will flow into the hydrocarbon-producing zone and the wellbore, resulting in a well that produces mainly water instead of the desired hydrocarbon. Furthermore, if there is still the desire to continue producing hydrocarbons from the well, operators must solve the serious problem of safely disposing of the undesired water. Addressing the problems arising from an out-of-zone fracture will also add expenses to the operation. In addition, if the fracture propagates into an adjacent non-hydrocarbon producing formation, the materials used to maintain a fracture after the fluid pressure has decreased may be wasted in areas outside the productive formation area. In short, it is expensive to efficiently operate a well that has been fractured out of the hydrocarbon-producing zone.
[0007] Because of the serious problems that can occur as a result of out-of-zone fractures, it is desirable to determine formation fracture development. Several techniques and devices are known for monitoring and evaluating formation fracture development, such as radioactive tracers in the fracturing fluid, temperature logs, borehole televiewers, passive acoustics and gamma-ray logging. Most techniques provide some direct estimates of fractured zone height at the wellbore.
[0008] One known process used to determine formation fracture height development employs a radioactive tracer. In this process, a fracturing fluid containing a radioactive tracer is injected into the formation to create and extend the fractures. When these radioactive fluid and proppant tracers are used, post fracture gamma-ray logs have shown higher levels of activity opposite where the tracer was deposited, thereby enabling operators to estimate the vertical development of the propped fractures.
[0009] Another approach for determining fracture height uses temperature and gamma-ray logs. Temperature logs made before and after stimulation are compared to define an interval cooled by injection of the fracturing fluid and thus provide an estimate of the fractured zone. However, this technique is subject to limitations and ambiguities. For example, the temperature log may be difficult to interpret because of low temperature contrast, flowback from the formation before and after the treatment, or fluid movement behind the borehole casing. In addition, the use of radioactive tracers may give rise to environmental problems such as the pollution of underground water streams, and the like, and hence be undesirable.
[0010] Other known methods for evaluating fracture geometry include using a borehole televiewer or using acoustical methods. Utilizing a borehole televiewer is limited in that it can only be used for fracture height evaluation in open holes. In addition, utilizing a borehole televiewer is limited due to the extreme temperature and pressure conditions present in deeper completions. Acoustical methods are hampered by inhomogeneous formation impedance and/or the need for pumping while the tool is in the wellbore.
