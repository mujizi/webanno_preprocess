[0095] The Tuszynski paper also discloses that: "At least three of these tubulins, namely, .quadrature., .quadrature., and .quadrature., exist in many organisms as families of closely related isotypes. An enigmatic feature of tubulin is its heterogeneity. Not only can and .quadrature.-tubulin exist as multiple isotypes in many organisms, but the protein can also undergo various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, detyrosination, and polyglutamylation." As authority for this statement, the paper cites a work by A. Banergee, "Coordination of posttranslational modificatioins of bovine brain. tubulin, polyglycylation of delta2 tubulin," Journal of Biological Chemistry 277:46140-46144, 2002).
[0096] The Tuszynski paper also discloses that "At the molecular level tubulin's roles are highly complex and are related to the structural variations observed." As authority for this proposition, the article cites a work by K. L. Richards et al., "Structure-function relationships in yeast tubulins," Molecular Biology of the Cell 11:1887-1903, 2000.
[0097] The Tuszynski paper also states that: " . . . microtubules undergo cycles of rapid growth and disassembly in a process known as dynamic instability that appears to be critical for microtubule function, especially in mitosis. A guanosine triphosphate (GTP) tubulin hydrolyzes bound GTP to GDP; the kinetics of this process in beta-tubulin is critical in regulating dynamic instability by affecting the loss of a so-called `cap` that stabilizes the microtubule structure." As authority for this statement, the article cites a work by T. J. Mitchison et al., "Dynamic instability of microtubule growth," Nature 312:237-242, 1984.
[0098] The Tuszynski paper also discloses "In addition to forming microtubules, tubulin interacts with a large number of associated proteins. Some of these, such as tektin, may play structural roles; others, the so-called microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) such as tau or MAP2, may stabilize the microtubules, stimulate microtubule assembly and mediate interactions with other proteins. Still others, such as kinesin and dynein, are motor proteins that move cargoes, e.g., vesicles, along microtubules." As authority for these statements, the article refers to works by M. Kikkawa et al. ("Switch-based mechanisms of kinesin motors," Nature 411:439-445, 2001) and Z. Wang et al. ("The C-terminus of tubulin increases cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin processity," Biophysical Journal 78:1955-1964, 2000).
[0099] As is also disclosed in the Tuszynski et al. paper, "The precise molecular basis of the properties of tubulin is still not well understood, in part because tubulin's highly flexible conformation . . . makes it difficult to crystallize this region." As authority for this statement, the article cites a work by O. Keskin et al., "Relating molecular flexibility to function: a case study of tubulin," Biphysical Journal 83:663-680, 2002.
