In some ways, jet aircraft symbolize a traditional conflict between technological progress and individual rights and privacy. On one hand, development of jet powered transport aircraft has been a giant step forward in improving airline convenience by shortening the transit time between cities and countries. On the other hand, because the turbine engines used by such aircraft have been noisy, especially during takeoff and landing, jet aircraft annoy people in communities located in the vicinity of airports. As a result, there is a continuing worldwide concern about the noise produced by turbine engines. Sensitive to this concern, aircraft and engine manufacturers have developed, and are continuing to develop, noise-suppression devices adapted to reduce engine noise. (As used herein, turbine engines include turbo-prop, turbo-fan and turbojet engines.)
Most modern aircraft are powered by fan-jet engines, which have a number of noise sources. These noise sources contribute to various noises having different frequency characteristics. As turbine engine noise has become better understood, various types of noise have been given identifying names. Of the identified types of noise, the major contributors to noise during takeoff and landing are denoted buzz saw, forward generated fan and aft generated fan noise. The name buzz saw is generally associated with noise covering a broad frequency band, for example from 50 to 2400 Hertz, produced a series of tones 50 to 60 Hertz apart. The names forward and aft generated fan noise are generally associated with discrete tones covering narrow frequency ranges that are primarily emitted from the front and rear of the engine respectively. For example, foward generated fan noise may be a discrete tone having a center frequency of about 2,200 Hertz, plus harmonics thereof. Attempts have been made to attenuate the aforementioned types of noises by lining selected regions of the inlet and fan air duct of fan-jet engines with various types of noise absorbing acoustic panels. In the past, the principal noise absorbing acoustic panels used in such turbine engines have been single or multilayer cellular acoustic panels.
While bulk absorber panels have been tested for use in turbine engines, for various reasons previous designs have been found to be unacceptable for use in production engines. More specifically, the bulk absorber panels previously tested in jet engines have excellent broadband noise attenuation characteristics in the range from about 50 to about 4,000 Hertz. A typical bulk absorber panels includes a layer of bulk absorber material mounted between a back sheet and a perforated face sheet. The perforated face sheet allows sound to enter the bulk absorber material. The face sheet, in combination with the back sheet, gives the bulk absorber panel a limited amount of structural stiffness. One disadvantage of bulk absorber panels is that when they are located in a high speed airflow region, such as the inlet and fan air duct of a fan-jet engine, the openings in the face sheet allow air and contaminants to impinge on the bulk absorber material. Contaminants can change or destroy the acoustic properties of the bulk absorber material. Turbulence and high speed air flows in close proximity to the bulk absorber material can cause it to disintegrate and be carried out of the panel through the openings in the face sheet. Not only are the noise attenuation characteristics of the bulk absorber material destroyed by this process, the disintegrated bulk absorber material can be harmfully sucked into the high pressure sections of the engine. Because of this susceptibility to break down, bulk absorber linings have found little use in production aircraft engines.
Another problem with bulk absorber panels is that the structural stiffness provided by only a perforated face sheet and a back sheet is inadequate to permit such panels to be effectively utilized in turbine engines. More specifically, because of the limited structural stiffness of bulk absorber panels, many structural members are required to ensure that the panels are structurally secure within the jet engine inlet and fan air duct. The many structural members needed to support the bulk absorber panels have the obvious disadvantage that they add considerable unwanted weight to the engine. In addition, the structural members have the disadvantage that they result in a significant loss of effective acoustical area and, thus, loss in the amount of noise that can be absorbed or attenuated. That is, structural stiffeners do not, of course, have noise absorbtion qualities. Rather, they form hard noise reflecting surfaces.
In an attempt to increase the stiffness of bulk absorber panels, bulk absorber material has been mounted in the cells of a honeycomb layer mounted between a back sheet and a perforated face sheet. (See U.S. Pat. No. 3,095,943 entitled "Acoustical Structure" and U.S. Pat. No. 3,380,552 entitled "Acoustical Panel With Honeycomb Core and Ventilation Passages".) The disadvantage of mounting bulk absorber material within the cells of the honeycomb layer is that trapped water and other contaminants can accumulate within the cells and add considerable weight to the jet engine. Moreover, the water trapped in the honeycomb cells can freeze and melt because of the temperature extremes experienced by a jet engine as an aircraft changes altitudes between takeoff and landing. Such freezing and melting can cause both the honeycomb layer and the bulk absorber to break up or fracture. Additionally, trapped water and other contaminants reduce the noise attenuation capabilities of bulk absorber materials and, in the extreme, may totally prevent noise suppression. Further, the installation of bulk absorber material in individual honeycomb cells is extremely difficult; and, such installation severely restricts the type of bulk absorber material that can be used.
