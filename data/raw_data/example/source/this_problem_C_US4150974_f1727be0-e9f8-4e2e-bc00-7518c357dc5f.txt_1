The ladle is raised and lowered on a platform arrangement 26 comprising a platform 27 upon which the ladle 1 is placed and a pair of hydraulic rams 28 are provided beneath the platform 27 to enable the platform, and therefore the ladle, to be raised and lowered as required. Only about 10% of the ladle contents are usually drawn into the upper chamber during in any one degassing cycle, and therefore usually about 10 cycles are sufficient to ensure complete degassing for the entire contents of the ladle.
As mentioned previously it is important for maximum efficiency of the degassing operation that the end of the snorkel 21 be placed at a depth in the metal in the ladle 1 sufficient to ensure that none of the slag layer enters the snorkel, but the depth should not be so great as to reduce the efficiency of the degassing by an excessive amount of metal being degassed during one cycle. However, owing to variation in the thickness of the slag layer it is not possible to accurately control the position of the snorkel relative to the interface between the metal and the slag because the interface cannot be seen. When the immersion depth is not sufficient, slag enters the snorkel and floats to the top of the metal in the degassing chamber where it contacts the carbon heating elements and the refractory lining. The heating elements are very susceptible to attack by molten slag and are expensive and time consuming to replace. Also, the very large amount of oxygen present in the slag as compared to molten metal also very seriously reduces the efficiency of a vacuum degassing process.
In order to meet this problem, and in accordance with this preferred form of the invention, an additional electrode sensing facility is provided to accurately determine the position of the interface between the slag and the metal in the ladle 1 prior to positioning of the snorkel.
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 4-6 of the drawings, the additional electrode facility indicated as 29 includes a lower electrode in the form of a metal pipe or tube 30 carrying an ebonite insulating plug 31 in its upper end, which plug is threadably received within the lower end of an upper elongate lance 32 in the form of a pipe. An electrical wire 33 is attached to the electrode 30 at a point 34 as shown, and extends up through a hole 35 through the plug 31 and then up through the upper elongate lance 32 and outwardly therefrom to be coupled to a voltage recorder 36, which may be a potentiometric recorder or voltage activated light, with the other side of the recorder being earthed as shown.
The circuit for current flow is completed by a current flow existing between the electrode 30 and the steel shell of the ladle 1 through the refractory lining which is at ground potential. The electrical resistance between the contents of the ladle 1, and the earth (to which the recorder 36 is also connected at one of its terminals) should not be more than about 20,000 ohms, and therefore, if necessary, additional means to ensure the contents of the ladle are reasonably well earthed may be provided, and the earth wire 15 leading from the stopper rod 2 to the steel shell of the ladle 1 through the recorder V, will suffice. In the alternative embodiment where the electrode 3 is secured in a ladle brick the lead wire again, if necessary, can be connected to the steel shell of the ladle 1. Another technique could involve the use of pure carbon in the head of the stopper rod 2, and this would ensure good electrical contact with the steel shell of the ladle 1, which is itself earthed.
