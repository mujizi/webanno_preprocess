This invention is adapted to be embodied in an engine control system and method for an internal combustion engine having a plurality of combustion chambers that fire in a predetermined sequence. An air induction system for supplies an air charge to the engine. A plurality of fuel injectors are provided, one for each combustion chamber for supplying fuel thereto. An exhaust system discharges the burnt charge from the engine. Means are also provided for starting the engine.
In accordance with an engine operated in accordance with the invention, a control is provided for controlling the operation of the fuel injectors by controlling both their timing of injection and the duration of injection. When the engine is being started up by the starting means, the injectors are all fired simultaneously so as to inject a predetermined amount of fuel from each injector. However, once the engine is running, the injectors are fired in the firing order sequence.
Another feature of the invention is adapted to be embodied in a method for operating an engine as described. In accordance with this method, when the starting means for the engine is operated, the injectors are all fired simultaneously so that each injects a predetermined amount of fuel at the same time. However, when the engine is running, the injectors are fired in their normal firing order sequence.
