[0028] FIG. 5 is a schematic illustration of a system for fracturing a well in accordance with another embodiment of the invention in which liquefied natural gas is heated by a heat-exchanging fluid during its descent through the well; and
[0029] FIGS. 6a, 6b and 6c are schematic illustrations of a system for fracturing a well in accordance with another embodiment of the invention in which an inert cryogenic fluid is used to cool at least the pumping and fracturing equipment before the liquefied natural gas is pumped into the well.
[0030] In general, and as will be explained below in detail, the invention provides a method and system for fracturing a subterranean formation using liquefied natural gas (LNG) or liquefied methane, hereinafter referred to collectively as liquefied natural gas. The liquefied natural gas is pumped as a cryogenic fluid at pressures and flow rates that are high enough, to fracture the subterranean formation requiring stimulation. After fracturing operations are complete, the natural gas used as fracturing fluid can be recovered and commercialized without loss or damage to the environment, rendering this method of fracturing highly economical and environmentally sound. The LNG can be blended with proppants before or after pumping and is optionally heated either before it enters the well or during descent through the well bore.
[0031] As used in this disclosure, "liquefied natural gas" means liquefied methane and blends of liquefied methane (CH.sub.4) with any other normally gaseous hydrocarbons and/or atmospheric gases normally found in liquefied methane-based products generally referred to as "natural gas".
[0032] FIG. 1 schematically illustrates an apparatus for practicing a method of fracturing a subterranean formation in accordance with an embodiment of the invention in which liquefied natural gas is pumped directly into a well. As shown in FIG. 1, a fracturing system in accordance with the invention is generally designated by reference numeral 10. A LNG source 12, for example a pressure vessel containing LNG can be a static structure, a mobile unit carried by a tanker truck, a train or a pipeline for on-site delivery of LNG to terrestrial wells, or by a tanker vessel for delivery to offshore wells.
