Another primary purpose of the drilling fluid is to lift cuttings from the wellbore. The drilling mud is circulated down the drill string, through the bit, and returns to the surface through the annular space between the drill string and the wellbore wall. The mud returning to the surface is known as return fluid comprising drilling mud, formation particles called cuttings, and possibly some formation fluids. The drilled cuttings are picked up at the bit and returned to the surface for separation from the mud and for disposal. This removal of the drilled solids from the mud stream is critical to the subsequent reconditioning of the mud for recirculation in the well.
To control and improve drilling performance, evaluation of wellbore condition is important. Keeping the hole clean, especially in extended reach wells, is a key issue as cuttings accumulation in the annulus can contribute to, if not directly cause, pipe sticking and twist-offs. This is a concern when drilling a deviated well since a bed of cuttings is almost always formed on the lower side of the drill pipe. By measuring the cuttings discharge at the surface, the buildup of cuttings in the well can be detected early and remedial action taken to prevent a catastrophic failure.
Another obstacle encountered in drilling operations is washout. Washout is excessive borehole enlargement caused by solvent and erosion action by the drilling fluid. Washout can cause severe damage to the formation, contaminate the connate formation fluids, and waste costly drilling mud. Early detection through the measurement of cuttings exiting the wellbore can also help the mitigation of this problem.
In typical cuttings evaluation, the cuttings from the well are discharged over one or more shale shaker screens to separate them from the drilling mud, and all cuttings coming from the shakers are weighed. With expected cuttings density known by the user, the expected volume of the cuttings is calculated and the volume removed is compared to the volume calculated. Thus hole-cleaning efficiency is evaluated.
Currently the main types of mud out weight sensors used are a strain gauge and suspended heavy weight system, systems using differential pressure plates in the mud pit, and radioactive source sensors. Some of the mud adheres to the cuttings and is carried over with the cuttings discharged from the shale shaker. This portion of mud is lost to the mud system, which has been reported to be as high as two barrels of mud for every barrel of cuttings. The mud lost in the cuttings causes accuracy problems with the first two sensor types. The third system, although more accurate, is costly and requires certification and approval. The first two systems are not accurate enough for the cuttings removal performance application because of the settlement of the cuttings in the pits.
