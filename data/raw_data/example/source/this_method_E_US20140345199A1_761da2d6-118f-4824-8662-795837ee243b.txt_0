<First Feature>
[0053] A first feature of the present invention is that a surface of the gasket seal 20 is covered with conductive fiber 24. When the gasket seal 20 made of a rubber material is covered with the conductive fiber 24, the surface of the gasket seal 20 can be made conductive. Accordingly, electro-magnetic waves can be prevented from entering the airframe from the gasket seal 20 between the door 13 and the airframe.
[0054] Here, the gasket seal may be also made conductive by mixing a conductive filler such as metal into a rubber material without using the conductive fiber 24. However, in this method, when the conductive filler in an amount sufficient enough to prevent the entrance of electro-magnetic waves is mixed into the rubber material, flexibility, stretch, resilience, hardness or the like of the gasket seal are affected, so that airtight sealing performance of the gasket seal is deteriorated. Meanwhile, in accordance with the method of the present invention in which the surface of the gasket seal 20 is made conductive by covering the surface of the gasket seal 20 with the conductive fiber 24, the entrance of electro-magnetic waves from the gasket seal 20 can be prevented without deteriorating the airtight sealing performance of the gasket seal 20.
[0055] A gap between the door 13 and the opening portion 12 of the airframe may be also electro-magnetically shielded by a metallic gasket having spring characteristics. Examples of the metallic gasket include a commercially-available Finger Stock fabricated from metal such as beryllium copper and corrosion resistant steel (CRES). However, since the metallic gasket has a gap and does not have airtight sealing performance, the gasket seal 20 made of a rubber material is used in the present invention as described above.
[0056] As one example of the conductive fiber 24, synthetic fiber where a metal plating film is formed on a surface is cited. When the door 13 is made of aluminum alloy, an electro-magnetic shielding effect can be obtained by using a good conductor such as Ag, Cu, Ni, Tin, Cr, and Au as a material of the above metal plating.
