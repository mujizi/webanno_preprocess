[0003] The present invention relates to active noise reduction for reducing, using reference signal supply means, an error microphone and control speaker, the level of a noise source, such as an unsteady sound having a varying sound pressure level, an intermittent sound including silent portions and emitted by a sound source that intermittently stops, or a sound emitted from a moving sound source. More particularly, it relates to a control method and apparatus for suppressing sound pressure at the position of an error microphone.
[0004] 2. Description of the Related Art
[0005] In active control, when a Filtered-X least mean square (LMS) algorithm as a generally used arithmetic algorithm is used, noise that greatly fluctuates in sound pressure level, or error factors in the varying acoustic path of a moving sound source may lead to degradation of control effect, whereby the control is inevitably destabilized. Further, since the LMS algorithm is of a gradient-method type, it does not require a large number of computations and hence is very stable. However, it has a fatal problem that a lot of time is required for amplitude convergence. Because of this problem, the LMS algorithm is hard to apply to level-varying noise or moving noise.
[0006] In light of the above, direct algorithms have been contrived. For example, in an algorithm directed to a steady sound emitted from a moving sound source (disclosed in, for example, Kijimoto et al., "Active Audio Control Utilizing Algorithm That Follows Change in Error Route at High Speed," published by the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, 14.sup.th Environment Engineering General Symposium 2004, Lecture Articles, pp. 42-45; Sasaki et al., "Active Audio Control of Noise From the Outside," published by the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, 13.sup.th Environment Engineering General Symposium 2003, Lecture Articles, pp. 49-52), a single fixed filter K and its adaptive filters K and D are installed as well as an adaptive filter C for updating the coefficient of a control filter C, and a virtual error signal is generated based on an error microphone signal to update the coefficients of the adaptive filters. Since the same gradient-type LMS algorithm as the conventional Filtered-X algorithm is used for updating the coefficients, the convergence speed cannot be improved, either. However, there is no error route as a control-destabilizing factor, and hence no amplitude divergence occurs even in the case of a sound emitted form a moving sound source, which means that stable control can be realized.
[0007] The method developed to aim higher-speed amplitude convergence in the above stable control state is a direct fast transversal filter (FTF) method.
