[0963] U.S. Pat. No. 6,433,187 also discloses that "The present invention generally provides tubulin binding agents that selectively and covalently bind to tubulin. The agents are derivatives of compounds which non-covalently bind to the colchicine binding site, the vinca alkaloid binding site, or the rhizoxin/maytansine binding site of tubulin. Additionally, the derivatives are formed by the attachment of a fluorinated aromatic electrophile to the parent non-covalent compounds, or by the replacement of a portion of the parent compound with the fluorinated aromatic electrophile. As used herein, the term derivative is also meant to include those agents in which a fluorinated aromatic electrophile is attached to the parent compound via a linker, preferably a linker which increases the electrophilic character of the fluorinated aromatic electrophile. Still further, the term "derivative" is meant to include those compounds in which small portions of the parent compound are replaced with fragments of similar size that also serve to enhance the reactivity of the fluorinated aromatic electrophile."
[0964] U.S. Pat. No. 6,433,187 also discloses that "In other preferred embodiments, the agent is a derivative of a compound selected from the group consisting of colchicine, podophyllotoxin, combretastatin, nocodazole, stegnacin, dihydroxy-pentamethoxyflananone, 2methoxyestradiol, vinblastine, vincristine, dolastatin, curacin A, etoposide, teniposide, sanguinarine, griseofulvin, cryptophycins or chelidonine."
[0965] Certain amide derivatives may be used as tubulin binding agents in the process of this invention; and these agents preferentially bind covalently to beta tubulin, as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,405, the entire dislclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification," Microtubules are intracellular filamentous structures present in all eukaryotic cells. As components of different organelles such as mitotic spindles, centrioles, basal bodies, cilia, flagella, axopodia and the cytoskeleton, microtubules are involved in many cellular functions including chromosome movement during mitosis, cell motility, organelle transport, cytokinesis, cell plate formation, maintenance of cell shape and orientation of cell microfibril deposition in developing plant cell walls. The major component of microtubules is tubulin, a protein composed of two subunits called alpha and beta. An important property of tubulin in cells is the ability to undergo polymerization to form microtubules or to depolymerize under appropriate conditions. This process can also occur in vitro using isolated tubulin."
[0966] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,405, "Microtubules play a critical role in cell division as components of the mitotic spindle, an organelle which is involved in distributing chromosomes within the dividing cell precisely between the two daughter nuclei. Various drugs and pesticides prevent cell division by binding to tubulin or to microtubules. Anticancer drugs acting by this mechanism include the alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, and the taxane-based compounds paclitaxel and docetaxel {see, for example, E. K. Rowinsky and R. C. Donehower, Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 52, 35-84 (1991)}. Other antitubulin compounds active against mammalian cells include benzimidazoles such as nocodazole and natural products such as colchicine, podophyllotoxin and the combretastatins. Benzimidazole compounds which bind to tubulin are also widely used anthelmintics {McKellar, Q. A. and Scott, E. W., J. Vet. Pharmacol. Ther., 13, 223-247 (1990)}. Anti-tubulin herbicides are described in "The Biochemical Mode of Action of Pesticides", by J. R. Corbett, K. Wright and A. C. Baillie, pp. 202-223, and include dinitroanilines such as trifluralin, N-phenylcarbamates such as chlorpropham, amiprophos-methyl, and pronamide. Fungicides believed to act by binding to tubulin include zarilamide {Young, D. H. and Reitz, E. M., Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Systemic Fungicides and Antifungal Compounds, Reinhardsbrunn, ed by H. Lyr and C. Polter, 381-385, (1993)}, the benzimidazoles benomyl and carbendazim, and the N-phenylcarbamate diethofencarb {Davidse, L. C and Ishi, H. in "Modem Selective Fungicides", ed. by H. Lyr, 305-322 (1995)}."
[0967] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,405, "Due to the success of tubulin as a biochemical target for drugs and pesticides, there is considerable interest in discovering new compounds which bind to tubulin. Various cell-free methods are available for detecting such compounds. A common method involves measuring the ability of test compounds to inhibit the polymerization of isolated tubulin into microtubules in vitro {see for example, E. Hamel, Medicinal Research Reviews, 16, 207-231 (1996)}. In a second method, interactions of test compounds with isolated tubulin can be detected in binding assays by measuring the ability of the test compound to influence binding of a second tubulin-binding ligand, used as a probe. (The term "test compound" means a compound which one wishes to evaluate, i.e. to test, for its ability to affect tubulin). Typically, the probe is radiolabeled to enable binding to be measured. A test compound which binds to tubulin may influence binding of the probe by binding to the same site on the tubulin protein as the probe, and thus reduce the amount of probe which binds. Alternatively, binding may be influenced by means of an "allosteric" interaction in which the test compound binds to a different site from that of the probe and induces a conformational change in the tubulin protein which affects the binding site of the probe. Such an allosteric interaction may either increase or decrease binding of the probe. A third approach involves measuring the effect of test compounds on tubulin-associated guanosine triphosphatase activity {Duanmu, C., Shahrik, L. K., Ho, H. H. and Hamel, E., Cancer Research, 49, 1344-1348 (1989)}."
