[1002] It is preferred that the free charges present in the P moiety and the N moiety have a drift mobility of at least about 10 cm/volt/second and, preferably, at least about 50 cm.sup.2/volt/second. In one embodiment, the free charges have a drift mobility of at least about 100 cm.sup.2/volt/second and, more preferably, at least about 1000 cm.sup.2/volt/second. In yet another embodiment, the free charges have a drift mobility of at least about 5000 cm.sup.2/volt/second.
[1003] As is known to those skilled in the art, drift mobility is the increase in the average velocity of a charge carrier per electric field intensity. Reference may be had, e.g., to U.S. Pat. No. 4,319,187 ("Method for measuring the drift mobility in doped semiconductors"), the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. Reference may also be had to equation 3-18 of page 148 of J. S. Blakemore's "Solid State Physics," W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, Pa., 1969.
[1004] Referring again to FIGS. 7, 8A, and 8B, the P moiety 443 is allowed to assemble until at least about 90 weight percent of the of the P tubulin dimer has so assembled. During this process, one may mix the reaction mixture with a mixer 445. One may also add agents via line 436 that facilitate such self-assembly such as, e.g., guanosine triphosphate, magnesium salt (such as magnesium chloride), standard buffers, etc.; many of these reagents are described elsewhere in this specification.
[1005] When at least about 90 weight percent of the P dimer 435 has self-assembled, an N-type dimer 437 is preferably added and reacted using substantially the same reaction conditions as were used, e.g., in step 438 (see FIG. 7). The N-type dimer 437 will add onto the end of the growing microtubule 450 (see FIG. 8B). After the turbidity meter 426 indicates that the polymerization of the dimer 437 is substantially complete, one may then add another reagent.
[1006] The other reagent may be another P dimer (so that one may form a PNP structure), and/or it may be one or more of the other reagents specified elsewhere in this specification.
