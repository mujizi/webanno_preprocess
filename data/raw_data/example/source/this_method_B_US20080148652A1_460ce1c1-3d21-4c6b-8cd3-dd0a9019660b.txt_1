[0064]The CMP tool that was used is a Mirra.RTM., manufactured by Applied Materials, 3050 Boweres Avenue, Santa Clara, Calif., 95054. A Rodel Politex.RTM. embossed pad, supplied by Rodel, Inc, 3804 East Watkins Street, Phoenix, Ariz., 85034, was used on the platen for the blanket wafer polishing studies. Pads were broken-in by polishing twenty-five dummy oxide (deposited by plasma enhanced CVD from a TEOS precursor, PETEOS) wafers. In order to qualify the tool settings and the pad break-in, two PETEOS monitors were polished with Syton.RTM. OX-K colloidal silica, supplied by DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials L.L.C., at baseline conditions.
[0065]In blanket wafers studies, groupings were made to simulate successive film removal: first copper, next tantalum, and finally the PETEOS. The tool mid-point conditions were: table speed; 123 rpm, head speed; 112 rpm, membrane pressure, 2.0 psi; inter-tube pressure, 0.0 psi; slurry flow, 200 ml/min
[0066]Defect counts were measured using a Surfscan.RTM. SP1 instrument manufactured by KLA Tencore, located at 1-Technology Drive, Milipita, Calif., 95035. This instrument is a laser-based wafer surface inspection system. Using this instrument, particles and surface defects on unpatterned substrates were obtained. The particle count was recorded as number of defects, location of defects, and the size of defects. Also, this instrument was used for measuring surface quality through characterization of surface roughness and classification of defects such as haze, pits, scratches, mounds, dimples, and stacking faults. Experiments were done by loading the wafers under vacuum wand into a cassette, followed by placing the cassette on the SP1 instrument using a Novellus.RTM. copper calibration standard. This method classifies defects ranging from 0.2 micron to 2.5 micron. The sum of all defect values was recorded as post CMP defects as reported in Table 1.
Wafers
[0067]Polishing experiments were conducted using electrochemically deposited copper, tantalum, and PETEOS wafers. These blanket wafers were purchased from Silicon Valley Microelectronics, 1150 Campbell Ave, CA, 95126. The film thickness specifications are summarized below:
