Because of the nature of the layout of main sewer pipe and laterals it is generally recognised that to insert a lining into a lateral, the best method is to evert the lining tube into the lateral by a "launcher" type apparatus which is positioned inside the main sewer. A main reason for proceeding in this way is that access to the lateral from the consumer point is inconvenient to the user, and frequently users will object strongly to working for effecting lateral lining, from a position inside the dwelling or building. It is obviously much better if the contractor can perform the lining operation from inside the main sewer as the consumer is therefore in no way disturbed other than to have the service cut off for a short period whilst the lateral lining takes place.
In "launcher" apparatus, the apparatus is designed so as to have a pressure enclosure so that fluent medium under pressure can be applied to that enclosure, the enclosure has an outlet and is adapted so that the tube to be everted into the lateral extends from the outlet, and then a collar or flange thereof can be held in relation to the outlet so that by pressurising the enclosure the tube is everted into the lateral. The tube may be and preferably is enclosed in a carrier tube which simply forms a carrier for the lining tube and everts with the lining tube into the lateral. When the lining tube is in position, the carrier tube is removed so that it can be reused. A carrier tube is particularly important when the lining tube is one which is impregnated with a curable resin, the carrier tube being in such arrangement a tube of a rubber like material such as neoprene, which is reinforced with fibrous scrim.
One of the difficulties in effecting a lateral lining is to provide an effective sealing for the lining tube around the outlet of the lateral where it meets the main sewer. If the sealing is not effective, the lining tube can slip or it can ruck and folds may be left therein when it is finally placed in the lateral, and the present invention seeks to provide a means and method for overcoming this problem.
In accordance with the invention in a first aspect there is provided a lining for lining of a lateral pipe branding off from an underground pipeline or passageway, characterised in that a lining tube at one end is provided with a preformed sealing collar adapted to conform and seal to the inner face of the piping in the region where said lateral is connected to a mains pipe.
In accordance with the present invention in a second aspect, a lateral lining method comprises using a preformed collar of a sheet material which under pressure will conform to the shape of the main sewer pipe and will effectively seal around the lateral connection to the main pipe, and wherein a said collar is attached to the underside of a flange or collar of the lining tube, and wherein a "launcher" holds the sealing collar and lining collar adjacent the lateral opening, and when the pressure chamber is pressurised, the lining tube is everted through the sealing collar and lining tube collar into the lateral.
