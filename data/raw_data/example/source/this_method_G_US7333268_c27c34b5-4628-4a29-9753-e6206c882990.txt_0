FIGS. 7a-c are cross-sections of materials of the present system that illustrate alternative embodiments of the icon elements. FIG. 7a depicts a material having lenses 1 separated from icon elements 108 by optical spacer 5. Icon elements 108 are formed by patterns of colorless, colored, tinted, or dyed material applied to the lower surface of optical spacer 5. Any of the multitude of common printing methods, such as ink jet, laserjet, letterpress, flexo, gravure, and intaglio, can be used to deposit icon elements 108 of this kind so long as the print resolution is fine enough.
FIG. 7b depicts a similar material system with a different embodiment of icon elements 112. In this embodiment the icon elements are formed from pigments, dyes, or particles embedded in a supporting material 110. Examples of this embodiment of icon elements 112 in supporting material 110 include: silver particles in gelatin, as a photographic emulsion, pigmented or dyed ink absorbed into an ink receptor coating, dye sublimation transfer into a dye receptor coating, and photochromic or thermochromic images in an imaging film.
FIG. 7c depicts a microstructure approach to forming icon elements 114. This method has the benefit of almost unlimited spatial resolution. The icon elements 114 can be formed from the voids in the microstructure 113 or the solid regions 115, singly or in combination. The voids 113 can optionally be filled or coated with another material such as evaporated metals material having a different refractive index, or dyed or pigmented material.
FIGS. 8a,b depict positive and negative embodiments of icon elements. FIG. 8a shows positive icon elements 116 that are colored, dyed, or pigmented 120 against a transparent background 118. FIG. 8b shows negative icon elements 122 that are transparent 118 against a colored, dyed, or pigmented background 120. A material of the present system may optionally incorporate both positive and negative icon elements. This method of creating positive and negative icon elements is particularly well adapted to the microstructure icon elements 114 of FIG. 7c.
FIG. 9 shows a cross-section of one embodiment of a pixel-zone material of the present system. This embodiment includes zones with lenses 124 having a short focus and other zones with lenses having a long focus 136. The short focus lenses 124 project images 123 of icon elements 129 in icon plane 128 disposed at the focal plane of lenses 124. The long focus lenses 136 project images 134 of icon elements 137 in icon plane 132 disposed at the focal plane of lenses 136. Optical separator 126 separates short focus lenses 124 from their associated icon plane 128. Long focus lenses 136 are separated from their associated icon plane 132 by the sum of the thicknesses of optical separator 126, icon plane 128, and second optical separator 130. Icon elements 137 in the second icon plane 132 are outside the depth of focus of short focus lenses 124 and therefore do not form distinct synthetically magnified images in the short focus lens zones. In a similar manner, icon elements 129 are too close to long focus lenses 136 to form distinct synthetically magnified images. Accordingly, zones of material bearing short focus lenses 124 will display images 123 of the icon elements 129, while zones of material bearing long focus lenses 136 will display images 134 of icon elements 137. The images 123 and 134 that are projected can differ in design, color, OPM direction, synthetic magnification factor, and effect, including the Deep, Unison, Float, and Levitate effects described above.
