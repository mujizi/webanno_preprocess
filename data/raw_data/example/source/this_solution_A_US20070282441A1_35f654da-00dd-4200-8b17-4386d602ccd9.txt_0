[0009] Accordingly, it has been disclosed that the VBR may be inserted initially into the intervertebral space in a first orientation where the upper and lower surfaces and the teeth thereon face laterally outward and then be rotated secondarily so that the teeth are brought into engagement with and embed into endplates of the vertebrae. This allows distraction of the adjacent vertebrae to be kept to a minimum. Stability of the spine benefits from the VBR having a contour or shape that generally follows the surface shape of the endplates. As the endplates are generally slightly concave, the surface portions of the VBR including the gripping teeth often have a corresponding contour. In this configuration, the spacing between the side surfaces of the VBR will generally be less than between the toothed surfaces for maintaining the vertical distraction required prior to VBR insertion.
[0010] Accordingly, rotation of the VBR in the intervertebral space may result in significant stress upon the VBR since the rotation may require forcing the vertebrae apart a small amount. Because the VBR typically has a body of relatively small size for fitting in the intervertebral space and particularly if cavities are formed therein for graft material, VBR rotation can generate undesirably high compressive force on the VBR.
[0011] A number of solutions have been attempted for addressing these compressive forces due to the rotation. The trend in the field is that device manufactures are reducing the size of VBRs to such a degree so that rotation thereof requires less separation of the vertebrae. However, this solution comes at the expense of having the VBR securely positioned in the intervertebral space with the teeth securely gripping the adjacent vertebral surfaces. Another trend is to form the VBRs with a strong material, such as PEEK, and avoid the use of natural bone or artificial bone materials such as hydroxyapatite or allograft.
[0012] Unfortunately, these stronger materials are not bio-resorbable. The purpose of the fusion procedure is to develop a lattice, matrix, or solid mass of bone joined with and extending between the adjacent vertebrae and through the intervertebral space. Eventually, the formed or developed bone and the vertebrae are joined to provide a somewhat unitary, incompressible structure that maintains the proper pre-fusion spatial relationship for the size to reduce or eliminate the impingement on the spinal cord. The VBR formed of these stronger materials is unable to transubstantiate into bone, join with bone, or be absorbed by the body for replacement by bone growth. This results in a boundary interface between the implant device and any resultant bone growth. Again, this is often addressed by reducing the size of the VBR so that more graft material may often be packed into the intervertebral space around the VBR. However, as mentioned, this is done at the cost of having secure implantation of the VBR.
[0013] As noted, the intervertebral space receives the VBR or implant device as well as an amount of graft material. The graft material may be in a number of forms, such as cancellous bone chips, which are packed into the intervertebral space and around the VBR. For VBRs with internal cavities opening on at least one side to the intervertebral space, graft material is also placed within the cavities so that bone may grow through the VBR device and join with bone formation throughout the intervertebral space.
