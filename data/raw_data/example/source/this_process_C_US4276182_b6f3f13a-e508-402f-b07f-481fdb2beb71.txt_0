The method of the present invention can be used for implacing conventional well cementing compositions which are well known to those skilled in the art. These compositions are primarily mixtures of cement and water, with or without the addition of accelerators or retarders to speed up, or hinder, respectively, the hardening time of the cements. The method of the present invention comprises first inserting in the wellbore and into contact with the water base or oil base drilling mud present therein, the spacer composition of this invention, followed by introduction of the cement composition. The cement composition is pumped into the wellbore under a pressure sufficient to displace the drilling fluid and the spacer material upward in the annulus between the casing and wellbore until substantially all of the cement composition is passed from the interior of the casing into the annulus where it is held until it hardens. The spacer is maintained between the drilling fluid and the cement composition during this process of implacement and while the cement composition is allowed to harden. Although the normal procedure in cementing casings is to pump the cement composition down the interior of the casing and upwards into the annulus, it is possible, and this invention also covers, the implacement of a cement composition in an annulus by injecting the cement composition into the annulus at the earths surface, thereby displacing drilling fluid in the wellbore of the interior of the casing as the cement composition passes downwardly in the annulus.
The well drilling spacer compositions of the present invention comprise an aqueous mixture of attapulgite clay stabilized with a small amount of zinc oxide, zinc carbonate or a water soluble zinc salt and adjusted to a pH of at least about 7 and preferably from about 8 to about 10. In addition, conventional types of cement retarding or accelerator agents, surfactants, and defoaming agents, can be added, as needed, to obtain the desired characteristics depending upon the borehole conditions, the cement employed, and the drilling fluid being used. Because the spacer composition is water based and contains no oils it is especially suited for offshore drilling operations where oil containing spacers cannot be employed.
The amount of attapulgite clay, also known as fullers earth, employed in the spacer compositions of this invention will vary over wide ranges depending upon the desired spacer weight. For any application, the weight of the spacer composition should be somewhere between the weight of the drilling fluid and the weight of the cement slurry. Thus, usually it is recommended that a spacer composition be at least about 0.5 pounds per gallon heavier than the weight of the drilling mud. This weight difference will help insure total displacement of the drilling fluid. The spacer compositions of the present invention can be formulated so as to have weights generally in the range of from about 8 to about 22 pounds per gallon. For the purpose of attaining the desired spacer composition weight, various weighting agents known in the art can be employed. One preferred weighting agent is barite which, due to its fine grind, and specific gravity of 4.3, finds wide acceptance as a weighting agent in conventional types of drilling fluids.
