[0007] Similarly, it is known (I. Barnes et al., presentation to the US/German Environmental Chamber Workshop, Riverside, Calif., Oct. 4-6, 1999) that the addition of acetals to diesel oils slightly improves the environmental characteristics of their exhaust gases. For example, trials on methylal additions (CH.sub.2(OCH.sub.3).sub.2 and n-butylal (C.sub.4H.sub.9OCH.sub.2OC.sub.4H.sub.9) to diesel oils of petroleum origin have demonstrated that the emission of particles and of NO.sub.x are greatly reduced and in the case of butylal the cetane number is also improved. However, the effect of improving the properties of the diesel oils in cold by acetal addition is not mentioned.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0008] It is known that when triglycerides are reacted (vegetable oils or animal fats) with alcohols in known transesterification processes mixtures are obtained with approximately 80% fatty acid esters (usually methyl or ethyl esters) together with approximately 20% crude glycerine, the commercial application of which is problematic. This problem has been solved in the framework of this invention by converting the crude glycerine into acetals, cetals, and/or glycerine triacetate. The mixture of these products with methyl or ethyl esters of fatty acids permits biodiesel fuels to be obtained with improved properties, especially at low temperatures, the production potential of biodiesel fuels to be increased and avoids the need to find alternative markets for crude glycerine that generally require laborious and expensive purification procedures.
[0009] Crude glycerine is inherently insoluble in methyl or ethyl esters of fatty acids. However, if this glycerine is reacted with aldehydes, ketones and/or acetic acid or methyl or ethyl acetates, the corresponding cetals, acetals and/or acetic acid or glycerine triacetate obtained, are completely soluble in these methyl or ethyl esters of fatty acids and reduce their viscosity and freezing point, making this greatly superior to biodiesel fuels obtained according to the current art.
[0010] Therefore, the procedure of the invention includes the following basic steps:
