When the throttle valve 17 assumes the throttling position F, the outlet pressure becomes lower than the inlet pressure and thus the pressure acting on the first pressure receiving portion 30 of the throttle valve 17 is higher than that of the third pressure receiving portion 32, so that the throttle valve 17 is acted upon by a force that urges it to shift to the communicating position E. The throttle valve 17 then shifts to and stops at a position where the force urging the throttle valve toward the communicating position E and the force urging it toward the throttling position F balance each other. The opening area of the throttle valve 17 corresponds to the pressure difference between the load pressure of the left- and right-side travel motors 6, 16 and the load pressure of the working machine cylinder 21.
Because the delivery fluids of the first and second hydraulic pumps 1, 11 are throttled by the throttle valve 17 to such a degree as will correspond to the pressure difference as they flow into the working machine circuit 18, the left- and right-side travel motors 6, 16 and the working machine cylinder 21 are supplied with the pressurized fluid in amounts proportional to the opening areas of the individual operation valves.
In other words, if the throttle valve 17 is not provided, when the load pressure of the working machine cylinder 21 is low, the delivery fluids of the first and second hydraulic pumps 1, 11 are merged and flow only to the working machine cylinder 21. In that case, the amount of fluid supplied to the traveling or propelling system will become insufficient. To avoid this problem, the throttle valve 17 is installed to throttle the fluid to the working machine system.
Next, the process when only the working machine operation valve 20 is operated will be explained.
The load pressure of the working machine cylinder 21 is applied through the third load pressure circuit 26" to the pressure receiving portion 45 of the merge/separation selector valve 43 to shift the selector valve 43 to the position J, with the result that the pressure receiving portion 42 of the merge/separation valve 40 communicates with the tank thereby shifting the merge/separation valve 40 to the flow merging position G.
