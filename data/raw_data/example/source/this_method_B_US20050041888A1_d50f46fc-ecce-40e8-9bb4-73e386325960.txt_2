[0195] Eleventh Embodiment
[0196] Referring to FIG. 16, still another method for making an openable and re-closable container having the contents stored therein will be discussed hereinafter.
[0197] In this method, preparing of an empty container 10a that is substantially similar to that according to the first embodiment and has a pouring-opening 40 is initially performed. Thereafter, storing of the contents into the storage section 18 is carried out utilizing any suitable receiving base means 80 that has a sloped surface 81. More particularly, prior to storing of the contents into the storage section 18, the container 10a is carried on the sloped surface 81 of the receiving base means 80 with the pouring-opening 40 being located at an upper position, with a region of the storage section 18, which is slightly lower than a substantially middle portion of the storage section 18, being folded, and with the communicating section 22 being laid on the sloped surface 81. In the condition where the container 10a is carried on the sloped surface 81 of the receiving base means 80 in such a manner as described above, the seal sheets 28a, 28b are protected in such a manner that the concentrated liquid 34 does not strike directly against the end portions of the opposite seal sheets 28a, 28b which are adjacent to the storage section 18, when the concentrated liquid 34 is poured into the storage section 18 through the pouring-opening 40 from the nozzle 44a of the filler 44.
[0198] In the condition where the container 10a is carried on the sloped surface 81 of the receiving base means 80, the nozzle 44a of the filler 44 is inserted into the pouring-opening 40, and the pouring of the concentrated liquid 34 into the storage section 18 is performed using the filler 44. After the storing of the concentrated liquid into the storage section 18 is completed, the pouring-opening 40 is sealed, whereby a finished container is produced.
[0199] In this method, the pouring of the concentrated liquid into the storage section 18 is carried out in the condition where the seal sheets 28a, 28b are isolated from the concentrated liquid to be stored within the storage section 18 by causing the container to be folded, and protected, so that there is no possibility that the sealing portions 32 of the opposite seal sheets 28a, 28b will be peeled or separated from each other due to any shock which is applied to at the time when the concentrated liquid 34 supplied from the nozzle 44a of the filler 44 drops within the container. Therefore, the contents hardly attach to between the sealing portions 32 of the opposite seal sheets 28a, 28b and the adhesion between the seal sheets 28a, 28b hardly falls. Also, at the time of pouring of the contents into the storage section 18, the contents hardly flow between the sealing portions 32 of the seal sheets 28a, 28b and toward the openable section 20, and hardly attach to the inner surfaces of the seal sheets 28a, 28b and the surfaces of the first opposite wall regions forming the openable section 20. Therefore, when the opening 21 is to be formed by tearing the predetermined areas of the first opposite wall regions forming the openable section 20, the person can sanitarily handle the container without touching the contents.
