[0039] It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that Equation 1 is written in vector form, because rotation of the housing and the drill string are not necessarily in the same direction. When the housing rotates in the same direction as the drill string, the drill string rotation rate is equal to the sum of the absolute values of R.sub.S-H and R.sub.H. When the housing rotates in the opposite direction as the drill string, the drill string rotation rate is equal to the difference between R.sub.S-H and R.sub.H.
[0040] To illustrate, assume the drill string 30 is rotating clockwise at 100 rpm. If the housing 110 is rotating clockwise at 20 rpm, then the difference between the rotation rates of the shaft 115 and the housing 110 is 80 rpm. The drill string rotation rate is then equal to the sum of the absolute values of the two measured rotation rates (R.sub.S-H+R.sub.H). If the housing is rotating counterclockwise at 20 rpm, then the difference between the rotation rates of the shaft 115 and the housing 110 is 120 rpm. The drill string rotation rate is then equal to the difference between the absolute values of the two measured rotation rates (R.sub.S-H-R.sub.H).
[0041] This may seem to be a backwards means of calculating the rotation rate of the drill string, but it must be understood that a steering tool 100 having sensors and electronics located in the housing 110, has no direct means of determining the rotation rate of the shaft 115 or drill string 30. It is possible, however, to use sensors in the housing 110 to determine the rotation rate of the housing 110 and the difference between the rotation rate of the shaft 115 and the housing 110. Thus, the backwards calculation provides a real-world solution to the challenge. To make this solution work, however, requires an accurate means to determine both the rotation rate of the housing 110 and the difference between that rate and the rotation rate of the shaft 115.
[0042] FIGS. 3 and 4 show exemplary embodiments of sensor arrangements used to determine rotation rates. A cross section of one exemplary embodiment of sensor arrangement 200 is shown in FIG. 3. The sensor arrangement 200 is disposed to measure the difference in rotation rates of the shaft 115 and the housing 110. In the exemplary embodiment shown on FIG. 3, sensor arrangement 200 includes a Hall-effect sensor 210 deployed on an inner surface 112 of the housing 110. Sensor arrangement 200 further includes a plurality of magnetic markers 215 deployed in a ring member 117 about the shaft 115. In use, Hall-effect sensor 210 sends a pulse to a controller (described in more detail below) each time one of the magnetic markers 215 rotates by the sensor 210. The controller then typically calculates the difference between the rotation rates of the shaft 115 and the housing 110 based upon the time interval between sequential pulses. It will be appreciated that sensor arrangement 200 is not limited to any number of magnetic markers 215. Furthermore, in alternative embodiments, the Hall-effect sensor may be deployed on the shaft 115 and the magnetic markers may be deployed on the housing 110.
[0043] Moreover, it will further be appreciated that sensor arrangement 200 is not limited to a Hall-effect sensor 210 and magnetic markers 215 as shown on FIG. 3. Rather, substantially any suitable sensor arrangement may be utilized. For example, in one alternative embodiment, sensor arrangement 200 may include an infrared sensor configured to sense a marker including, for example, a mirror reflecting infrared radiation from a source located near the sensor. An ultrasonic sensor may also be employed with a suitable marker. A pressure sensor deployed in the hydraulic module 130 (FIG. 2) may also be utilized, for example, as disclosed by Webster in U.S. Pat. No. 5,603,386. The invention is not limited in these regards.
