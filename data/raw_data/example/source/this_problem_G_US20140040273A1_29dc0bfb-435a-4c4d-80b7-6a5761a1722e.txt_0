[0060] An additional source of metadata for all videos may be user-provided bookmarks. For example, bookmarks can be created by the user at various portions. These bookmarks may be linked to text annotations or identified faces or objects, so this information can be readily incorporated as metadata to link together video segments. Further, bookmarks can themselves link directly to other video segments, which may also affect performance of the system.
[0061] For the non-presentation videos, OCR can again be applied to the results of generic shot segmentation, can be used to the extent that text is present. For example, text overlays in in broadcast news graphics can be analyzed to identify segments regarding the specific story. Additionally, a banner or ticker displayed along the bottom of the frame that may display text that can be analyzed.
However, in non-presentation videos, frequently no reliable text might be recovered and thus OCR processing of each individual segment may not be useful for providing video recommendations. Though text availability at the segment level may be limited, several options exist to alleviate this problem. One method to overcome text scarcity (discussed in U.S. Patent. Pub. 2008/0288537 A1, filed on May 16, 2007, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference) is using all text within a larger temporal window (e.g. covering multiple segments) to augment the text from an individual segment with the text from temporally near segments. An alternative may be to use multi-level indexing at both the video (or topic) level and the segment level in combination (discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,783,106, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference). In this alternative, a hierarchical segmentation may be used to add text in a non-uniform temporal window based on content-based similarity (i.e. topic segmentation).
[0062] Both of these approaches may also use a weighting scheme that emphasizes text detected in or temporally near a current segment. Further, a hybrid approach could also use a weighted combination of video-level manually created metadata (e.g. from the video URL) with the automatically extracted text from the video itself with a second weighting to emphasize a current segment of interest. For non-presentation videos, analogous processing can be accomplished by combining generic video shot segmentation with text derived from Automatic Speech Recognition Techniques (ASR) (or closed caption transcripts could be used if available), as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
