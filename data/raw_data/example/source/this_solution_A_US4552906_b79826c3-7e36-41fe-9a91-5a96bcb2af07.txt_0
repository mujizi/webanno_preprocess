Dental material according to the invention
10 parts by weight of a polyester containing polycarbonate groups (Example 3 in DE-OS (German Published Specification) 2,732,718) and 0.5 part by weight of dibenzoyl peroxide are dissolved in a mixture of 80 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate and 20 parts by weight of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate.
100 parts by weight of the bead polymer from Example 1 and 60 parts by weight of microfine silanized silicon dioxide (mean primary particle size=30 nm, BET surface area=130 m.sup.2 /g, silanized with 20% methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane) are stirred into this solution, a viscous, slightly tacky composition being produced. By heat treatment at 40.degree. C. for 2 hours, the mixture acquires a plastic, doughy consistency.
The mixture is injection or compression molded and cured in 6 minutes at 130.degree. C.
It will be understood that the specification and examples are illustrative but not limitative of the present invention and that other embodiments within the spirit and scope of the invention will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art.
