[0204] FIG. 28 is a diagram of an example of a screen for accepting selection of input objects displayed by the display processing unit 1901 when selection of a surface having RECEIVE shown thereof of the virtual cube is accepted. As in the processing procedure described above, item keys indicated as FAX and EMAIL are displayed on an enlarged surface. When the user depresses the item key FAX, the selection accepting unit 403 accepts selection of the item key FAX and considers that a Fax original is accepted as an input object. When the user depresses the item key EMAIL, the selection accepting unit 403 accepts selection of the item key EMAIL and considers that an e-mail received in the name of the user authenticated by the user authenticating unit 406 is accepted as an input object. The input processing unit 411 applies input processing to the input objects for which these selections are accepted.
[0205] FIG. 29 is a diagram of an example of a screen for accepting selection of input objects displayed by the display processing unit 1901 when selection of a surface having LOAD shown thereon of the virtual cube is accepted. As shown in the figure, the display processing unit 1901 displays items keys MFP, DESKTOP, INTERNET, NETWORK, and STORAGE on an enlarge surface. When the user depresses any one of these item keys, the selection accepting unit 403 accepts selection of the item key depressed and considers that selection of a corresponding medium as an input object.
[0206] FIG. 30 is a diagram of a screen for accepting selection of an output destination displayed by the display processing unit 1901 when selection of a surface having PRINT shown thereon of the virtual cube is accepted. The display processing unit 1901 performs enlarged display processing for a surface of the virtual cube. As shown in the figure, the display processing unit 1901 displays an item key PAPER on this enlarged surface. When the user depresses the item key PAPER, the selection accepting unit 403 accepts selection of the item key depressed and considers that a paper medium is accepted as an output destination. When there is only one item key as shown in the figure, this processing may be omitted. After that, the display processing unit 1901 displays a preview at the time when output processing is performed by this function and a detailed setting screen. When surfaces having other output function markings shown thereon are depressed, in the same processing, the display processing unit 1901 performs processing up to display of a preview showing a summary of a result obtained by performing output processing.
[0207] FIG. 31 is a diagram for explaining the preview and the detailed setting screen displayed by the display processing unit 1901 when the selection accepting unit 403 accepts the selection of the item key PAPER. As shown in the figure, the display processing unit 1901 displays a preview showing a summary of a result of output processing and a detailed setting screen based on image data subjected to input processing. In this screen, respective setting items for performing detailed setting are displayed in block units around the preview screen. Conditions presently set in the respective items are displayed in these blocks. When the user depresses any one of the blocks, the selection accepting unit 403 is informed that the block is depressed. The display processing unit 1901 rotates a virtual polyhedron arranged in the block depressed and displays a surface having a different condition shown thereon. The selection accepting unit 403 accepts the new condition displayed in the block as being set.
[0208] Specifically, as shown in the figure, when a block indicated as SCREEN AGGREGATION is depressed, the selection accepting unit 403 accepts the block as being selected. The display processing unit 1901 performs display in which a virtual polyhedron arranged in the block and performs display for resting the virtual polyhedron at a point when a surface having TWO SCREEN AGGREGATION of the virtual polyhedron rotated comes to a position of the block. The selection accepting unit 403 accepts TWO SCREEN AGGREGATION as being selected. The display processing unit 1901 changes the result on the preview in the screen to a result obtained by performing output processing in TWO SCREEN AGGREGATION, selection of which is accepted, and displays the preview. Consequently, when the user depresses various setting items displayed in block units, the display processing unit 1901 displays a preview corresponding to a condition set anew in each of the items. Consequently, the user can easily understand an output processing result. Even when the user does not know a function of each of the blocks, when the user depresses the block, a preview showing a summary of a result obtained by performing output processing is changed. Thus, the user can intuitively understand content of the item of each of the blocks. Since the various setting items are shown in block units, it is possible to easily perform customization, for example, addition, change, or deletion of an arrangement of setting items available for each MFP 1900.
