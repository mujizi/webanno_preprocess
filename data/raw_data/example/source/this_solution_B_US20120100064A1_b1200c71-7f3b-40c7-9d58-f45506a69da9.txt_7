[0157] The silica-coated ferric-hydroxide-based compound particles as a precursor were subjected to a calcination process of calcining such particles at a temperature of substantially 1000.degree. C. in order to let such particles to be powdered, thereby producing heat-treated powders. Next, the heat-treated powders were added in an NaOH aqueous solution of 10 wt %, stirred for a day at a temperature of 70.degree. C., and subjected to a centrifugal separation process by a centrifugal separator. Thereafter, precipitants were collected and rinsed.
[0158] Thereafter, the rinsed precipitants were again added in an NaOH aqueous solution of 10 wt %, stirred for a day at a temperature of 70.degree. C., and subjected to a centrifugal separation process by a centrifugal separator. Thereafter, precipitants were collected and rinsed. Such precipitants collected in this way were .di-elect cons.-Fe.sub.2O.sub.3 particles having silica (SiO.sub.2) eliminated.
[0159] Next, with moisture being left by not through a dry process, a solid content concentration was adjusted to be 10 wt %, thereby producing a magnetic material slurry containing .di-elect cons.-Fe.sub.2O.sub.3 particles. Subsequently, a magnetic material slurry of a predetermined amount and a PEG 500000 aqueous solution of a predetermined amount were mixed at a predetermined ratio by weight. Water was added in this solution, and the addition of water was terminated when the solution viscosity became 170 cP. It was taken as the second coating liquid.
[0160] When an image of the second coating liquid was picked up by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a TEM image shown in FIG. 9B was obtained. Based on this TEM image, it was confirmed that the second coating liquid contained rod-like .di-elect cons.-Fe.sub.2O.sub.3 particles 22 having an aspect ratio of 2.4.
