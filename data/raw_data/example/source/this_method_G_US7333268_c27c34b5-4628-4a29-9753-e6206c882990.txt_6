A related icon image design method, illustrated in FIG. 24a, can be used to create combined synthetic image elements that are smaller in dimension than the smallest feature of the individual synthetic image elements. This is possible in the common circumstance where the smallest feature size of an icon image is larger than the placement accuracy of the feature. Thus an icon image may have minimum features on the order of two microns in dimension, but those features may be placed accurately on any point on a grid of 0.25 micron spacing. In this case the smallest feature of the icon image is eight times larger than the placement accuracy of that feature. As with the previous diagram this method is illustrated using a hexagonal icon pattern 594, but it applies equally well to any other usable pattern symmetry. In similar fashion to the method of FIG. 23, this method relies on the use of different information in at least one icon zone. In the example of FIG. 24a two different icon patterns, 596 and 598, are each present in half of the icon zones (for clarity only one of each pattern is shown in this figure). These icon images produce a composite synthetic image 600 that incorporates synthetic image 602 created by icon image elements 596, and synthetic image 604, created by icon image elements 598. The two synthetic images, 602 and 604, are designed to have overlapped areas, 606 and 608, that appear to have 100% color density while the non-overlapped areas 605 have 50% color density. The minimum dimension of the overlapped areas in the composite synthetic image may be as small as the synthetic magnification-scaled positioning accuracy of the icon image elements, and therefore may be smaller than the minimum feature size of the two constituent synthetic images that are designed to overlap in a small region. In the example of FIG. 23, the overlap regions are used to create the characters for the number "10" with narrower lines than would otherwise be possible.
This method can also be used to create narrow patterns of gaps between icon image elements, as shown in FIG. 24b. Hexagonal icon zones 609 could be square or any other suitable shape to make a space-filling array, but hexagonal is preferred.
In this example, half the icon patterns the icon image 610, and half of them are the icon image 611. Ideally these two patterns would be relatively uniformly distributed among the icon zones. All of the elements of these patterns are depicted as being of substantially equal and uniform color density. In isolation these two patterns do not clearly suggest the form of the final image, and this can be used as a security element--the image is not obvious until it is formed by the overlying lens array. One instance of the synthetic image 612 formed by the combination of the synthetic image of icon elements 610 with the synthetic image of icon elements 611 is shown, whereby the gaps that remain between the separate synthetic images form the numeral "10". In this case, two synthetic images are combined to form the final synthetic image, so the colored parts of this image 613 show 50% color density. This method is not limited by the details of this example: three icons could have been used instead of two, the gaps defining the desired element in the composite synthetic images can have variable widths and unlimited shape variety, and this method can be combined with either the methods of FIGS. 23, 24a,b or 25, or an other icon image design method we have taught.
Covert, hidden information can be incorporated into the icon images that cannot be seen in the resulting synthetic images. Having such covert information hidden in the icon images can be used, for example, for covert authentication of an object. Two methods for accomplishing this are illustrated by FIG. 25. The first method is illustrated by the use of matched icon images 616 and 618. Icon image 616 shows a solid border pattern and the number "42" contained inside of the border. Icon image 618 shows a solid shape with the number "42" as a graphical hole in that shape. In this example, the perimeter shapes of icon images 616 and 618 are substantially identical and their relative position within their respective icon zones, 634 and 636, are also substantially identical. When a composite synthetic image 620 is created from these icon images, the border of the composite synthetic image 622 will show 100% color density because all icon images have a pattern in that corresponding area, so there is full overlap in the synthetic images created from icon images 616 and 618. The color density of the interior 624 of the composite synthetic image 620 will be 50%, since the image of the space surrounding the "42" comes from icon images 618 that only fill half the icon zones, and the image of the colored "42" comes from icon images 616 that also fill half the icon zones. Consequently, there is no tonal differentiation between the "42" and its background, so the observed composite synthetic image 626 will show an image having a 100% color density border 628 and a 50% color density interior 630. The "42" covertly present in all of the icon images 616 and 618 is thereby "neutralized" and will not be seen in the observed composite synthetic image 626.
A second method for incorporating covert information into icon images is illustrated by triangles 632 in FIG. 25. Triangles 632 may be randomly placed within the icon zones (not shown in this figure) or they can be placed in an array or other pattern that does not substantially match the period of the icon zones 634, 632. Synthetic images are created from a multiplicity of regularly arrayed icon images that are imaged by a corresponding regular array of micro-lenses. Patterns in the icon plane that do not substantially correspond to the period of the micro-lens array will not form complete synthetic images. The pattern of triangles 632 therefore will not create a coherent synthetic image and will not be visible in the observed synthetic image 626. This method is not limited to simple geometric designs, such as triangles 632: other covert information, such as alpha-numeric information, bar codes, data bits, and large-scale patterns can be incorporated into the icon plane with this method.
