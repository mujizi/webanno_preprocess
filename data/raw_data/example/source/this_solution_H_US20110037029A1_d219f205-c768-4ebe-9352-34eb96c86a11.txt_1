Compound 6 (PEG Monomer)
[0098] To an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (100 mL, 0.3 M) was added DMF (100 mL) and compound 5 (2.20 g, 3.94 mmol). To this solution was added compound 2 (1.00 g, 5.92 mmol) in a solution of DMF, with stiffing at 4.degree. C. The reaction was monitored via TLC by ninhydrin stain for primary amines, and confirmed to be complete after 30 min. Water was added and the solution extracted with CHCl.sub.3 (3.times.25 mL). The organics were combined and dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent removed in vacuo. The crude product was purified by silica column (methanol/ethyl acetate gradient 0:100 to 5:95, v/v) to give the pure product as a pale yellow oil (1.88 g, 78% yield).
