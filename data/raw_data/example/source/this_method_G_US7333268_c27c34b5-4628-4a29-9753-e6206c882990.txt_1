FIG. 7b depicts a similar material system with a different embodiment of icon elements 112. In this embodiment the icon elements are formed from pigments, dyes, or particles embedded in a supporting material 110. Examples of this embodiment of icon elements 112 in supporting material 110 include: silver particles in gelatin, as a photographic emulsion, pigmented or dyed ink absorbed into an ink receptor coating, dye sublimation transfer into a dye receptor coating, and photochromic or thermochromic images in an imaging film.
FIG. 7c depicts a microstructure approach to forming icon elements 114. This method has the benefit of almost unlimited spatial resolution. The icon elements 114 can be formed from the voids in the microstructure 113 or the solid regions 115, singly or in combination. The voids 113 can optionally be filled or coated with another material such as evaporated metals material having a different refractive index, or dyed or pigmented material.
FIGS. 8a,b depict positive and negative embodiments of icon elements. FIG. 8a shows positive icon elements 116 that are colored, dyed, or pigmented 120 against a transparent background 118. FIG. 8b shows negative icon elements 122 that are transparent 118 against a colored, dyed, or pigmented background 120. A material of the present system may optionally incorporate both positive and negative icon elements. This method of creating positive and negative icon elements is particularly well adapted to the microstructure icon elements 114 of FIG. 7c.
FIG. 9 shows a cross-section of one embodiment of a pixel-zone material of the present system. This embodiment includes zones with lenses 124 having a short focus and other zones with lenses having a long focus 136. The short focus lenses 124 project images 123 of icon elements 129 in icon plane 128 disposed at the focal plane of lenses 124. The long focus lenses 136 project images 134 of icon elements 137 in icon plane 132 disposed at the focal plane of lenses 136. Optical separator 126 separates short focus lenses 124 from their associated icon plane 128. Long focus lenses 136 are separated from their associated icon plane 132 by the sum of the thicknesses of optical separator 126, icon plane 128, and second optical separator 130. Icon elements 137 in the second icon plane 132 are outside the depth of focus of short focus lenses 124 and therefore do not form distinct synthetically magnified images in the short focus lens zones. In a similar manner, icon elements 129 are too close to long focus lenses 136 to form distinct synthetically magnified images. Accordingly, zones of material bearing short focus lenses 124 will display images 123 of the icon elements 129, while zones of material bearing long focus lenses 136 will display images 134 of icon elements 137. The images 123 and 134 that are projected can differ in design, color, OPM direction, synthetic magnification factor, and effect, including the Deep, Unison, Float, and Levitate effects described above.
FIG. 10 is a cross-section of an alternate embodiment of a pixel-zone material of the present system. This embodiment includes zones with lenses 140 elevated by a lens support mesa 144 above the bases of the non-elevated lenses 148. The focal length of the elevated lenses 140 is the distance 158, placing the focus of these lenses in the first icon plane 152. The focal length of the non-elevated lenses 148 is the distance 160, placing the focus of these lenses in the second icon plane 156. These two focal lengths, 158 and 160, may be chosen to be similar or dissimilar. The elevated lenses 140 project images 138 of icon elements 162 in icon plane 152 disposed at the focal plane of lenses 140. The non-elevated lenses 148 project images 146 of icon elements 164 in icon plane 156 disposed at the focal plane of lenses 148. The elevated lenses 140 are separated from their associated icon elements 162 by the sum of the thickness of the lens support mesa 144 and the optical separation 150. The non-elevated lenses 148 are separated from their associated icon elements 164 by the sum of the thickness of the optical separation 150, the icon layer 152, and the icon separator 154. Icon elements 164 in the second icon plane 156 are outside the depth of focus of the elevated lenses 140 and therefore do not form distinct synthetically magnified images in the elevated lens zones. In a similar manner, icon elements 152 are too close to non-elevated lenses 148 to form distinct synthetically magnified images. Accordingly, zones of material bearing elevated lenses 140 will display images 138 of the icon elements 162, while zones of material bearing non-elevated lenses 136 will display images 146 of icon elements 156. The images 138 and 146 that are projected can differ in design, color, OPM direction, synthetic magnification factor, and effect, including Deep, Unison, Float, and Levitate effects.
