[0284]In response to the RRC connection request notification 2211, the radio network controller 104 uses the terminal information management section 202 to determine whether the ID of the terminal 101c is an ID of a new terminal 101c. In the present embodiment, the terminal 101c is in the shutdown state 2201 at first and therefore is judged as being a new terminal. Since the terminal 101c is new, the radio network controller 104 creates an entry for the terminal 101c in the terminal information management section 202 and determines the position of the terminal 101c indicated by a cell. In the present embodiment, the terminal 101c is in cell L2 and therefore cell L2 is registered as the position of the terminal 101c.
[0285]Then, the radio network controller 104 sends an RRC connection setup request 2212 (RRC CONNECTION SETUP in 3GPP TS 25.331) for establishing RRC connection. In response to this, the terminal 101c returns an RRC connection setup response 2213 (RRC CONNECTION SETUP COMPLETE in 3GPP TS 25.331) to the radio network controller 104 through the radio network controller 104 because the terminal 101c is ready for establishing RRC connection. As a result of the process above, the terminal 101c is registered with the UTRAN controlled by the radio network controller 104. This state is shown by state (a) in FIGS. 16 to 21. In this state, the terminal 101c is not registered with a packet controller 106 nor a mobile network packet gateway 107.
[0286]Returning to FIG. 15, after registration with the UTRAN, the terminal 101c performs a process for registering its position in a packet controller 106 (S1507). This process is shown in the sequence diagram of FIG. 23. The GPRS specification in 3GPP TS 23.060 and TS29.060 specifies that an ATTACH process is performed for registering the position in SGSN. The third embodiment differs from this specification of 3GPP in the following two ways. First, a signal to SGSN is relayed by the second WLAN access network 103b and the second WLAN gateway 105b of the wireless LAN network, and the radio network controller 104. Second, in 3G, ATTACH processes for registering the position with the circuit-switched domain of the core network of a mobile communication network and the packet-switched domain are integrated. In the third embodiment, an ATTACH to the packet-switched domain is performed in order to ATTACH to the wireless LAN network.
[0287]Regarding to the first difference, the terminal 101c uses Direct Transfer (Initial Direct Transfer, Uplink Direct Transfer, and Downlink Direct Transfer in 3GPP TS 25.331), which transfers signals to a core network through RRC since the terminal 101c does not have the address of the packet controller 106. When a signal directed to the packet controller 106 is input from the terminal 101c using Direct Transfer, the radio network controller 104 determines whether the signal is Direct Transfer, and transfers the signal from the terminal 101c to the packet controller 106 by using RANAP (RAN Application Part, which is a protocol between a core network and RNC in 3GPP defined in 3GPP TS 25.413). On the other hand, the packet controller 106 uses RANAP for transferring a signal directed to the terminal 101c. The relay function of the radio network controller 104 is represented by separations of arrows indicating the position registration request 2301 and response in FIG. 23. Packets to be sent from the terminal 101c to the radio network controller 104 are relayed by the second WLAN access network 103b and the second WLAN gateway 105b. While the relay points are represented by solid circles in FIG. 22, such indications are omitted from FIG. 23 and FIG. 24 described later.
[0288]It should be noted that instead of using Direct Transfer for relaying signals between the terminal 101c and the packet controller 106, items of information such as a header or tailer indicating the signal is a control signal relating to GPRS may be contained in each message and the radio network controller 104 may relay signals judged to be signals relating to the packet controller 106 such as GPRS by means of the items of information. Since this method also enables communication between the terminal 101c and the packet controller 106, advantageous effects of the third embodiment can be achieved.
