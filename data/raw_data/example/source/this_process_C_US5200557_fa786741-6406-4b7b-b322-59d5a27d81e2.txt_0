FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The field of this invention relates to the preparation of crude terephthalic acid by filtration and counter-current washing by water to prepare an aqueous slurry suitable for further processing to prepare purified terephthalic acid wherein the concentration of acetic acid retained in the washed filter cake is equal to or less than 5000 parts per million by weight (ppmw). An aqueous slurry thereby prepared is suitable for a reduction process. In one aspect, this invention relates to the preparation of an aqueous slurry of crude terephthalic acid suitable for a reduction process in the presence of a Group VIII metal catalyst. In another aspect, this invention relates to the preparation of an aqueous slurry of crude terephthalic acid suitable for hydrogenation of the crude terephthalic acid wherein the crude terephthalic acid has been prepared by oxidation of paraxylene in a solvent comprising acetic acid and the acetic acid is replaced by water in a positive displacement method in a procedure of counter-current flooded water washing under pressure. This process eliminates the need for a drying process previously used to remove the acetic acid by evaporation from the crude terephthalic acid. This process of counter-current flooded water washing under pressure of the crude terephthalic acid also operates to reduce the amount of wash water, to decrease the content of residual impurities in crude terephthalic acid, to recycle and recover the acetic acid, and/or decrease the load on downstream waste treatment equipment. In another aspect of this invention, the field of this invention relates to a process for positive displacement of aliphatic carboxylic acids from slurries of crude polycarboxylic acids prepared by oxidation of alkyl aromatics such as paraxylene, metaxylene, diisopropylbenzene, diethylbenzene and 2,6-dimethyl naphthalene in the presence of an aliphatic carboxylic acid of 1 to 5 carbon atoms wherein the aliphatic carboxylic acid of 1 to 5 carbon atoms is replaced by water in a counter-current method to permit reduction of the impurities in the aqueous slurry of crude polycarboxylic acid, in the presence of a Group VIII metal catalyst and hydrogen, and the aliphatic carboxylic acid of 1 to 5 carbon atoms can be recovered for recycle upstream. The field of this invention further relates to a process for preparing crude terephthalic acid suitable for reduction to prepare purified terephthalic acid, by hydrogenation in an aqueous medium in the presence of a Group VIII catalyst and hydrogen.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Usually terephthalic acid is produced by a liquid phase oxidation of p-xylene and/or p-toluic acid in a solvent comprising an aliphatic carboxylic acid such as acetic acid. Terephthalic acid is of great commercial importance and is widely used for the production of various different polymers, such as fiber-forming polyesters. A process for preparing polyesters of terephthalic acid, particularly polyethylene terephthalate, comprises a direct condensation of terephthalic acid with the respective polyalcohol. For example, terephthalic acid is reacted with ethylene glycol to form bis(.beta.-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate which is then polymerized in a second stage. This direct condensation process is simpler than other known methods such as transesterification of dimethyl terephthalate with the appropriate glycol. However, the direct esterification can desirably require the use of highly purified terephthalic acid. In order to be suitable for the production of polyester fibers, terephthalic acid must be substantially free of any contaminants which lower the melting point of the polyester and/or cause coloration of the polyester. In fact, some impurities which are contained in crude terephthalic acid are color-forming precursors. Additionally, some impurities act as chain terminators in the process to prepare polyesters.
