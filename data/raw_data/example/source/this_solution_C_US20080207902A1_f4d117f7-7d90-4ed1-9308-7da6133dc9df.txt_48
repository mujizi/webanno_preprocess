6-(7-methoxy-2-isopropyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)-5-methyl-3-(2H)-pyr-idazinone
[0856]Using the compound of Example 270, the reaction was carried out as in Example 276 to afford the title compound, or the title compound was produced by the following alternative process: The compound of Example 271 (3.55 g) was dissolved in methanol (70 mL)
[0857]To this solution, concentrated aqueous ammonia (20 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. Subsequently, additional concentrated aqueous ammonia (20 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for another 18 hours. The solvent was concentrated and the residue was recrystallized (chloroform:petroleum ether) to afford the title compound as a yellow brown powder (1.80 g).
