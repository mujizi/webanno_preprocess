This optical substrate 2 has the functionality of both a color filter incorporating the color pattern layer 100, and a microlens array incorporating the lenses 124. As a result, a bright color display can be achieved.
It should be noted that if the second and third light transmitting layers 130 and 150 can provide the desired mechanical strength, gas barrier properties, chemical resistance, and other properties required for the optical substrate, the corresponding first and second reinforcing layers 140 and 160 can be removed. In this case the second and third light transmitting layers 130 and 150 become protective films for the first light transmitting layer 120. Moreover, if the light transmitting layer 120 itself has sufficient strength, the second and third light transmitting layers 130 and 150 can also be omitted.
As described above, lenses 124 can be easily formed in a light transmitting layer 120 by transfer according to the present embodiment of the invention. It is therefore possible by means of this method to achieve highly efficient use of material, a reduction in the number of production steps, and cost reduction.
Furthermore, once manufactured, the first and second masters 110 and 20 can be used repeatedly insofar as durability allows. The steps required to produce the masters 110 and 20 can therefore be eliminated from the production process for the second and subsequent optical substrates, thereby further reducing the number of production steps and helping to further reduce cost.
