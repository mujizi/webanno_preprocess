[0132] In general, the method to identify a non-bacterial microorganism that has a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) polyketide synthase (PKS) system includes a first step of (a) selecting a microorganism that produces at least one PUFA; and a second step of (b) identifying a microorganism from (a) that has an ability to produce increased PUFAs under dissolved oxygen conditions of less than about 5% of saturation in the fermentation medium, as compared to production of PUFAs by said microorganism under dissolved oxygen conditions of greater than 5% of saturation, more preferably 10% of saturation, more preferably greater than 15% of saturation and more preferably greater than 20% of saturation in the fermentation medium. A microorganism that produces at least one PUFA and has an ability to produce increased PUFAs under dissolved oxygen conditions of less than about 5% of saturation is identified as a candidate for containing a PUFA PKS system. Subsequent to identifying a microorganism that is a strong candidate for containing a PUFA PKS system, the method can include an additional step (c) of detecting whether the organism identified in step (b) comprises a PUFA PKS system.
[0133] In one embodiment of the present invention, step (b) is performed by culturing the microorganism selected for the screening process in low oxygen/anoxic conditions and aerobic conditions, and, in addition to measuring PUFA content in the organism, the fatty acid profile is determined, as well as fat content. By comparing the results under low oxygen/anoxic conditions with the results under aerobic conditions, the method provides a strong indication of whether the test microorganism contains a PUFA PKS system of the present invention. This preferred embodiment is described in detail below.
[0134] Initially, microbial strains to be examined for the presence of a PUFA PKS system are cultured under aerobic conditions to induce production of a large number of cells (microbial biomass). As one element of the identification process, these cells are then placed under low oxygen or anoxic culture conditions (e.g., dissolved oxygen less than about 5% of saturation, more preferably less than about 2%, even more preferably less than about 1%, and most preferably dissolved oxygen of about 0% of saturation in the culture medium) and allowed to grow for approximately another 24-72 hours. In this process, the microorganisms should be cultured at a temperature greater than about 15.degree. C., and more preferably greater than about 20.degree. C., and even more preferably greater than about 25.degree. C., and even more preferably greater than 30.degree. C. The low or anoxic culture environment can be easily maintained in culture chambers capable of inducing this type of atmospheric environment in the chamber (and thus in the cultures) or by culturing the cells in a manner that induces the low oxygen environment directly in the culture flask/vessel itself.
[0135] In a preferred culturing method, the microbes can be cultured in shake flasks which, instead of normally containing a small amount of culture medium--less than about 50% of total capacity and usually less than about 25% of total capacity--to keep the medium aerated as it is shaken on a shaker table, are instead filled to greater than about 50% of their capacity, and more preferably greater than about 60%, and most preferably greater than about 75% of their capacity with culture medium. High loading of the shake flask with culture medium prevents it from mixing very well in the flask when it is placed on a shaker table, preventing oxygen diffusion into the culture. Therefore as the microbes grow, they use up the existing oxygen in the medium and naturally create a low or no oxygen environment in the shake flask.
[0136] After the culture period, the cells are harvested and analyzed for content of bioactive compounds of interest (e.g., lipids), but most particularly, for compounds containing two or more unsaturated bonds, and more preferably three or more double bonds, and even more preferably four or more double bonds. For lipids, those strains possessing such compounds at greater than about 5%, and more preferably greater than about 10%, and more preferably greater than about 15%, and even more preferably greater than about 20% of the dry weight of the microorganism are identified as predictably containing a novel PKS system of the type described above. For other bioactive compounds, such as antibiotics or compounds that are synthesized in smaller amounts, those strains possessing such compounds at greater than about 0.5%, and more preferably greater than about 0.1%, and more preferably greater than about 0.25%, and more preferably greater than about 0.5%, and more preferably greater than about 0.75%, and more preferably greater than about 1%, and more preferably greater than about 2.5%, and more preferably greater than about 5% of the dry weight of the microorganism are identified as predictably containing a novel PKS system of the type described above.
