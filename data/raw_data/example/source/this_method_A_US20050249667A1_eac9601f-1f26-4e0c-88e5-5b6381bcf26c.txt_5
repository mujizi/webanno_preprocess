[1203] Referring to FIGS. 43 and 44, sonic energy is delivered to the organ 7020 in the ultrasound range at frequencies and energy ranges that do not cause cavitation. U.S. Pat. No. 6,620,123 (Method and apparatus for producing homogenous cavitation to enhance transdermal transport) defines cavitation: as follows: "Broadly defined, cavitation is the formation of vapor- or gas-filled cavities in liquids when subjected to mechanical forces." The entire disclosure of said patent is incorporated by reference into this specification.
[1204] U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,526 teaches that "The cavitation effect becomes predominant when the acoustic power at the point of focus exceeds a threshold of 150 W/cm2. This cavitation effect is linked to the formation of microscopic bubbles of gas which explode when they reach a critical diameter with local release of appreciable amounts of energy leading to destruction of neighbouring tissue." The entire disclosure of said patent is incorporated by reference into this specification. Thus, cavitation due to ultrasound exposure is well known to those with ordinary skill in the art. Reference is also made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,601,526 (Ultrasound therapy apparatus delivering ultrasound waves having thermal and cavitation effects), 20030078227A1 (Site-directed transfection with ultrasound and cavitation nuclei), U.S. Pat. No. 6,413,216 (Method and assembly for performing ultrasound surgery using cavitation), 20010053384A1 (Site-directed transfection with ultrasound and cavitation nuclei), U.S. Pat. No. 6,309,355 (Method and assembly for performing ultrasound surgery using cavitation), U.S. Pat. No. 5,743,863 (High-intensity ultrasound therapy method and apparatus with controlled cavitation effect and reduced side lobes) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,497 (High-intensity ultrasound therapy method and apparatus with controlled cavitation effect and reduced side lobes). The entire disclosures of said patents are incorporated by reference into this specification.
[1205] U.S. Pat. No. 6,719,449 (Apparatus and method for controlling sonic treatment) teaches that cavitation can be measured in a variety of ways: "A variety of methods may be employed to detect cavitation. For example, acoustic emissions, optical scattering, high-speed photography, mechanical damage, and sonochemicals can be used. Optical scattering: Bubbles also scatter light. When bubbles art (sic) present, light is scattered. Light can normally be introduced into the system using fiber optic light sources so that cavitation can be detected in real-time, and therefore can be controlled by electronic and computer systems. High-speed photography: Bubbles can be photographed. This method typically requires high-speed cameras and high intensity lighting, because the bubbles respond on the time frame of the acoustics. It also requires good optical access to the sample under study. This method can give detailed and accurate data and may be a consideration when designing systems according to the invention. Stroboscopic systems, which take images far less frequently, can often give similar qualitative performance more cheaply and easily than high-speed photography. Mechanical damage: Cavitation is known to create damage to mechanical systems. Pitting of metal foils is a particularly common effect, and detection method. There is a correlation between the cavitation needed to pit foils and to disrupt cells. Sonochemicals: A number of chemicals are known to be produced in response to cavitation. The yield of these chemicals can be used as a measure of cavitational activity. A common technique is to monitor light generation from chemicals, such as luminol, that generate light when exposed to cavitation. Sonochemical yield usually can not be done during cell experiments but can be done independently under identical conditions, and thereby, provide a calibrated standard." The entire disclosure of said patent is incorporated by reference into this specification.
[1206] In one embodiment of the instant invention, the organ 7020 is exposed for about 1 minute, causing less than about 10% of the cells in the organ 7020 to lyse as a result of the treatment. In another embodiment, one can expose the organ 7020 for about 1 minute, causing less than about 5% of the cells in the organ 7020 to lyse as a result of the treatment. In a preferred embodiment, the organ 7020 is exposed to the apparatus described in FIG. 43 or 44 for about 1 minute, causing less than about 1% of the cells in the organ 7020 to lyse as a result of the treatment. In another preferred embodiment, one can expose the organ 7020 for about 1 minute, causing less than about 0.1% of the cells in the organ 7020 to lyse as a result of the treatment.
[1207] In another embodiment, exposure of the organ 7020 for about 1 minute causes measurable cavitation in about 1% of the cells in the tissue as a result of the treatment. In another embodiment, exposure of the organ 7020 for more than about 10 minutes causes measurable cavitation in about 1% of the cells in the tissue as a result of the treatment. In another embodiment, exposure of the organ 7020 for more than about 100 minutes causes measurable cavitation in about 1% of the cells in the tissue as a result of the treatment. In another embodiment, exposure of the organ 7020 for more than about 10 hours causes measurable cavitation in about 1% of the cells in the tissue as a result of the treatment.
