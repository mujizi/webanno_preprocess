[0008] The apparatus used to carry out the method for treating varicose veins is shown in FIG. 1 and includes an optical laser fiber 1, a guide wire (not shown) to place the fiber, ultrasound (not shown) for locating and viewing the fiber as it is situated in a body cavity (vein 2), and an introducer catheter 3 with a hemostasis valve. While this treatment arrangement is effective in treating varicose veins, a problem with the treatment method is that, as the length of the vessel being treated increases, contact between the fiber tip 4 and blood 5 in the vein can cause overheating and burn back of cladding and other buffer materials on the fiber tip, as illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2B.
[0009] In addition to damaging the fiber cladding, burn back can cause continued lasing, charring or carbonization, and weakened fiber integrity. For example, exposing the silica core of a fiber can allow carbonization to the sides of the fiber tip making it weak with the possibility of falling off into the vein. Furthermore, carbonization forming on the distal tip can locally heat the distal fiber tip surface to extreme temperatures sufficient to enough to cause the fiber to start absorbing infrared radiation, thereby causing a thermal runaway that could perforate the vein wall. Still further, charring and/or other effects of overheating or thermal runaway can directly cause negative effects on the patient, such as operative or post-operative pain and/or toxic reactions to compounds resulting from burning or vaporization of materials such as Teflon.TM.. Finally, if the burn back exposes the surfaces on the side of the fiber, then energy is stolen from the core, making the power density lower and effecting the treatment. Despite these problems, however, little has been done to prevent burn back, with the primary focus being to monitor the procedure and replace the fiber or clean the fiber tip before significant burn back occurs.
[0010] One solution is disclosed in German Patent Publication DE 31 19372. Since burn back is caused by blood contamination on the distal tip of the fiber, the German publication discloses a protective cap that is placed over the tip of the fiber and that prevents contact with blood. However, fibers with modified tips typically build up char and burn up or have break off failures and therefore this solution is not practical.
[0011] Another solution, as noted above, is simply to monitor the procedure. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,27 discloses a system that monitors pyrolytic glowing of burning tissues at the end of the fiber, while U.S. Pat. No. 6,932,809 monitors radiation emitted by a black body situated adjacent the fiber when the black body is heated. Unfortunately for the patient, by the time that pyrolytic glow or black body radiation is observed, substantial burn back, vein char or perforation may already have occurred. This is especially true of the pyrolytic glow described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,427, which can only be transmitted by the laser delivery fiber at wavelengths effectively less than 2 microns. In addition, the inclusion of a separate black body emitter, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,932,809, is both inconvenient and expensive.
[0012] Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,242,438 discloses a laser delivery apparatus that may be suitable for varicose vein treatment, although no such application is disclosed. This patent is of interest for its disclosure of a reflective tip, which may also be used in connection with the present invention. Unlike the tips of the present invention, however, the tip disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,242,438 is specifically intended to be exposed to bodily fluids, and therefore is vulnerable to burn back.
