U.S. Pat. No. 5,481,174 assigned to Motorola attempts to address the formation or appearance of shunts by regulating the average current, the current being dependent on a control time of reaching a pre-selected maximum voltage. Although this approach does help alleviate the decomposition of the electrolyte, it requires discharging of the cell and does not address the role of a time factor for current adjustment.
U.S. Pat. No. 5,442,274 teaches the use of hysteresis or repetitive peak and through charging prior to constant voltage charging. During peak charging, the battery is charged by a constant current or quasi-constant current, and during the trough of the charging wave, the battery charging process is either suspended or the charging current is reduced from the level at peak charging. This is a simplified charging process which does not adequately address the electrolyte decomposition concerns associated with lithium batteries.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,736,150 discusses the benefits of pulse charging to prolong the cycle life for a lithium molybdenum disulfide (Li/MoS.sub.2) batteries. Again this method does not address the cycle life problems or issues confronted when using lithium based rechargeable batteries.
The Benchmark Microelectronics reference discloses a hysteresis charging profile which uses a pulse current between maximum and predetermined minimum voltages. This technology which regulates current through frequency modulation avoids current tipper and can not be acceptable for lithium based batteries. The constant current amplitude creates problems associated with diffusion resistance as a result of ion transport problems inside the solid positive electrode. This resistance leads to an increase in the battery voltage and therefore to battery undercharge.
A need exists in the art for a method of charging lithium based batteries which improves cycle life, efficiency, and safety of the batteries.
