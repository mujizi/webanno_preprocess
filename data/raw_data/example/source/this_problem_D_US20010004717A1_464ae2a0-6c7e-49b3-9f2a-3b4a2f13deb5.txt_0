[0006] At a small plant, the number of the embroidery sewing machines is relatively small, and the number of kinds of the embroidery patterns ordered by the plant is also small. Therefore, the embroidery sewing machines can be easily managed. However, as the scale of the plant becomes large, the installation sites of the embroidery sewing machines are spread out in the plant and the number of kinds of the embroidery patterns ordered by the plant increases. Therefore, it is important to network the embroidery sewing machines. The supervisor assigns operations for embroidering a newly-ordered embroidery pattern to each embroidery sewing machine, and sends the embroidery data to be used in each embroidery sewing machine using the management computer. Wasted operations at the entire plant can be eliminated by such that the supervisor supplies materials and products as necessary in accordance with work progress, manages the operations so that the work is provided evenly to all operators, and speedily takes countermeasures toward the embroidery sewing machines when an abnormal condition occurs. Therefore, operating efficiency can be increased.
[0007] However, in the conventional management system, as the number of embroidery sewing machines to be managed increases, the amount of information to be displayed on the display of the management computer also increases. Accordingly, it is difficult to manage all the embroidery sewing machines at the same time. There may also be cases where the plants to be managed are spread out in all parts of the world. In this case, the number of embroidery sewing machines becomes enormous, so that the management of all the embroidery sewing machines becomes more difficult. In particular, it is serious when the information sent from all the embroidery sewing machines cannot be displayed in a frame on the display. In order to obtain the information of all the embroidery sewing machines, the supervisor has to scroll the information on the screen and interchange the pieces of the information. As a result, the supervisor gets tired, or confused, and may miss important information. Information of the desired embroidery sewing machine can be displayed by searching the information under certain criteria. However, a key operation, such as inputting new criteria every time searching criteria change is required causes the management operation to become troublesome and time is wasted.
[0008] On the other hand, as the number of the embroidery sewing machines to be managed further increases, the amount of data collected in the management computer becomes extremely large. Therefore, the amount of data may violate the capacity of the computer. In order to address this problem, a method is conceivable in which the number of the embroidery sewing machines to be managed by one management computer is reduced by using a plurality of management computers. However, if the number of the management computers is increased, the management is spread over many places. Accordingly, collective management becomes difficult. When the management computers are spread out in all parts of the world, data exchanged between the management computers may be mixed. Therefore, the collective management of the whole management system becomes more difficult.
[0009] In view of the foregoing problems, the invention provides a sewing apparatus management system that can manage a plurality of sewing apparatuses via a network with improved efficiency. In the sewing apparatus management system, one or more management computers are used to manage the plurality of sewing apparatuses.
[0010] According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, a sewing apparatus management system may include a plurality of sewing apparatuses; a plurality of terminals are provided, each corresponding to a one of the plurality of sewing apparatuses; and a management computer connected to the plurality of terminals via a network to manage the plurality of sewing apparatuses, various management information for the plurality of sewing apparatuses being transmitted from the plurality of terminals to the management computer; wherein the management computer comprises a classification information storage device to store classification information obtained by identifying the plurality of sewing apparatuses and classifying the same into a plurality of groups according to a category; and a managing device that selectively manages, when one of the plurality of groups is selected on the management computer, at least one sewing apparatus belonging to the selected group.
