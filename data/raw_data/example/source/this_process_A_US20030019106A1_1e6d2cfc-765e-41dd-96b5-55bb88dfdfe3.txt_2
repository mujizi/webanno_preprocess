1.) Rough Machining
[0338] It is preferred to initially rough out the dimensions of the surface using a specialized electrical discharge machining apparatus. Referring to FIG. 9, roughing a polycrystalline diamond compact sphere 903 is depicted. A rotator 902 is provided that is continuously rotatable about its longitudinal axis (the z axis depicted). The sphere 903 to be roughed is attached to a spindle of the rotator 902. An electrode 901 is provided with a contact end 901A that is shaped to accommodate the part to be roughed. In this case the contact end 901A has a partially spherical shape. The electrode 901 is rotated continuously about its longitudinal axis (the y axis depicted). Angular orientation of the longitudinal axis y of the electrode 901 with respect to the longitudinal axis z of the rotator 902 at a desired angle .beta. is adjusted to cause the electrode 901 to remove material from the entire spherical surface of the ball 903 as desired.
[0339] Thus, the electrode 901 and the sphere 903 are rotating about different axes. Adjustment of the axes can be used to achieve near perfect spherical movement of the part to be roughed. Consequently, a nearly perfect spherical part results from this process. This method produces polycrystalline diamond compact spherical surfaces with a high degree of sphericity and cut to very close tolerances. By controlling the amount of current introduced to the erosion process, the depth and amount of the heat affected zone can be minimized. In the case of a polycrystalline diamond compact, the heat affected zone can be kept to about 3 to 5 microns in depth and is easily removed by grinding and polishing with diamond impregnated grinding and polishing wheels.
[0340] Referring to FIG. 10, roughing a convex spherical polycrystalline diamond compact 1003 such as an acetablular cup or race is depicted. A rotator 1002 is provided that is continuously rotatable about its longitudinal axis (the z axis depicted). The part 1003 to be roughed is attached to a spindle of the rotator 1002. An electrode 1001 is provided with a contact end 1001A that is shaped to accommodate the part to be roughed. The electrode 1001 is continuously rotatable about its longitudinal axis (the y axis depicted). Angular orientation of the longitudinal axis y of the electrode 1001 with respect to the longitudinal axis z of the rotator 1002 at a desired angle .beta. is adjusted to cause the electrode 1001 to remove material from the entire spherical surface of the cup or race 1003 as desired.
[0341] In some embodiments of the invention, multiple electro discharge machine electrodes will be used in succession in order to machine a part. A battery of electro discharge machines may be employed to carry this out in assembly line fashion.
