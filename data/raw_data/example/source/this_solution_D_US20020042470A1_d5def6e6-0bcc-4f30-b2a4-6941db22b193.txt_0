[0061] Preparation of CH.sub.2.dbd.CHC(O)--O--CH(CF.sub.3)(CF(CF.sub.3).su-b.2) Homopolymer
[0062] Perfluoro(methyl isopropyl ketone) (64 g, 0.24 mol, can be prepared as described in Example 5 of World Published Application WO 01/05468) was reduced to the corresponding alcohol with NaBH.sub.4 (10.9 g, 0.29 mol, available from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) in 235 mL anhydrous diglyme (anhydrous diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, available from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) at approximately 0.degree. C. The reaction mixture was quenched with cold 10% aqueous HCI (200 miL). The lower phase was isolated, washed twice with 200 mL aliquots of saturated NaCl solution at 0.degree. C., dried over anhydrous MgSO.sub.4 and filtered to give a filtrate (80.7 g). The solvent was distilled from the filtrate to produce 56.7 g of 1,1,1,3,4,4,4-heptafluoro-3-(trifluoromethy-l)-2-butanol with a yield of 88% (b.p.=100-140.degree. C.). Analysis by proton and fluorine NMR showed the following peaks: -72.5(3F), -75.5(3F), -74.3(3F), -182.7(1F), 4.6 (1H), 3.8 (1H).
[0063] 25.7 g (0.096 mol) of the 1,1,1,3,4,4,4-heptafluoro-3-(trifluoromet-hyl)-2-butanol was dissolved in diglyme (50 ml) and the resulting solution was cooled to 5.degree. C. under a nitrogen blanket. Acryloyl chloride (9.5 g, 0.105 mol, available from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company) was added to this solution by syringe while stirring. To this solution was added diisopropylethyl amine (13.6 g, 0.105 mol, available from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) dropwise over a period of 35 minutes. After 2 hours, the reaction mixture was filtered to remove the solid by-products and the filtrate was diluted with methylene chloride (40 mL). The filtrate was then washed three times with 75 ML aliquots of saturated NaCl solution, dried over anhydrous MgSO.sub.4, filtered, and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation to leave a residue of 22 g of crude acrylate ester. The acrylate ester was purified via column chromatography using silica gel to produce 16.2 g of purified ester. Fluorine NMR analysis showed the following peaks: -74.3 (3F), -75.5(3F), -182.7(1F), -72.4(3F). Proton NMR analysis showed the following peaks: 6.15 (1H), and 3 olefinic hydrogens at 6.6, 6.2, and 6.1 ppm.
[0064] The purified acrylate ester (5.5 g, 0.017 mol) and VAZO.TM. 64 initiator (28 mg) was then dissolved in 30 g of ethyl acetate in a 4 oz (110 g) polymerization bottle. The solution was purged for 90 seconds using N.sub.2 at 1 L/min, then polymerization was affected by heating the solution for 26 hours by rotating the bottle in a heated water bath. After the polymerization, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The resulting yellow oil was twice dissolved in acetone and precipitated from solution with chloroform. The resulting solid was collected by filtration and dried. The structure of the homopolymer was verified by proton and fluorine NMR. Tg was 53.9.degree. C. with onset at 27.7.degree. C. The solid collected by filtration was dissolved at 3% solids in C.sub.4F.sub.9OCH.sub.3 (available as HFE-7100 Engineering Fluid from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn.).
