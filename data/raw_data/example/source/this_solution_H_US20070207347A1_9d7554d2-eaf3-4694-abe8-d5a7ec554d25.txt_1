Synthesis of MC-1
[0260]
[0261] 8-Hydroxyquinoline (4.64 g, 31.96 mMoles) was dissolved in acetonitrile (50 mL). To this solution was added 2.5M n-BuLi (15.5 mL, 36.36 mMoles) drop by drop at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the addition of the n-BuLi, the mixture was stirred for 1 hour. The yellow solid was filtered off, washed with a little cold water, acetonitrile and finally air dried. The yield of lithium 8-quinolate (Liq) was 4.8 g.
