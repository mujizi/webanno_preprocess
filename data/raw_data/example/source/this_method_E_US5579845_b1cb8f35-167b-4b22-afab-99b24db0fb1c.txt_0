Alternatively, an electrical arc generator can be utilized to generate the pressure waveforms and mass displacement. Preferably, the arc generator is activated at intervals of 2-10 seconds. In other embodiments of invention, the wave generation means comprises two or more gas venting apparatus, or a combination of at least one gas venting apparatus and at least one electrical arc generator.
In part, the present invention is a non-destructive method of mineral, biological, and scale removal from the pump, casing, and screen apparatus and geological structure surrounding a water well, including: (1) inserting means for generating percussive energy into the bore of a water well; (2) initiating percussive impact within the well bore; (3) monitoring the removal of mineral, biological and/or scale deposits; and (4) adjusting the percussive energy whereby the mechanical action of the energy propagating within the bore and surrounding geological structure enhances apparatus performance and improves water production. The energy generation means is selected from the group consisting of at least one percussive gas venting apparatus, at least one electrical arc generator, and combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments, the energy generation means is a percussive gas venting apparatus which includes a high pressure gas gun. In highly preferred embodiments, the gas gun further includes a deflector to focus the percussive energy generated. Likewise, in highly preferred embodiments, the air gun includes at least one hold-off member to position the gas gun within the well bore.
A preferred percussive gas venting apparatus is initiated to provide the percussive impact of about 1-15,000 cubic inches of gas at a pressure of about 50-1,000 psi. In highly preferred embodiments of this method, a preferred gas gun provides about 10-1,000 cubic inches of gas at a pressure of about 500-3,000 psi. Likewise, in highly preferred embodiments, the percussive impact is initiated at intervals of about 3-100 second.
In part, the present invention is a non-destructive method of rehabilitating a water well by removing impediments to water production, including: (1) lowering into the bore of a water well means for generating percussive energy, the generating means including a high pressure gas gun; (2) initiating percussive impact within the well bore; (3) monitoring the removal of mineral, biological, and/or scale and related production impediments; and (4) adjusting the percussive energy whereby the mechanical action of the energy propagating within the well bore improves water production. In preferred embodiments, the gas gun includes a deflector to focus the energy generated.
As discussed above, the benefits associated with use of a non-explosive, non-destructive source of pressure waveforms and/or mass displacement include downhole control and increased production rate. Through use of a percussive gas venting apparatus, the propagated energy is directly related to the volume of the air vented and the pressure at which it is vented. Both parameters and their effect on the well system can be controlled, monitored, and adjusted without withdrawing the apparatus from the well bore. To that effect, water well production can be stimulated, refurbished, and/or increased through the isolated or repetitious impact of the percussive energy on pumping, casing, and screen apparatus, as well as the geological formation surrounding the well bore. With respect to the latter situation, the pressure waveforms and mass displacement of the water volume can be directed to clean and/or remove scale from the formations surrounding an uncased well bore. Likewise, the surrounding geological formation of sand and gravel pack wells can be modified to increase production. The invention can also be used to dislodge geological bridges across the well bore and, in a similar fashion aid in the extraction of pumps, lodged drilling tools, casings, and screens.
