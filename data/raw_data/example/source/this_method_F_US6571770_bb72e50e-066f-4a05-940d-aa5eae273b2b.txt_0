It is known from EP 0367406 A2 to achieve a pressure rise in the cylinder of the diesel internal combustion engine by means of a turbocharger which is driven by exhaust gases of the latter. Arranged on the shaft of the turbocharger is the rotor of an electric machine which is operated as an externally fed motor during starting or when the diesel internal combustion engine falls below a predeterminable minimum rotational speed and is otherwise operated as a generator. This solution is highly complicated.
As regards the relevant prior art, reference is made to the publication of Hans-Josef Schiffgens et al., "Die Entwicklung des neuen MAN B&W Diesel-Gas-Motors 32/40 DG" ["The Development of the new MAN B&W diesel gas engine 32/40 DG"] in: MTZ Motortechnische Zeitschrift 58 (1997) 10, pp 584-590, from which a diesel gas engine is known, in which a fuel gas is supplied under relatively low pressure to the air inlet duct of the diesel internal combustion engine. The gas valve is controlled electronically, opened hydraulically and closed by spring force.
The so-called Miller method is known inter alia from the book by K. Zinner, "Aufladung von Verbrennungsmotoren" ["Supercharging of internal combustion engines"], 2.sup.nd edition, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York 1980, pp 221-228. In this method, the air inlet valve (VE) closes before the bottom dead center (UT) of the piston of the diesel internal combustion engine, as indicated in FIG. 2 by a closing line (21') illustrated by dashes. When an engine is operating with fixed control times by the Miller method, serious air deficiency phenomena may arise in the lower load range.
The invention, as defined in patent claim 1, achieves the object of specifying a more cost-effective method for operating a diesel internal combustion engine of the type initially mentioned, which makes sufficient combustion air available in all the cylinders even under part load and in transient operating states.
Advantageous refinements of the invention are defined in the dependent patent claims.
