(Stamper)
[0097] The method for forming a nano concave-convex structure to the stamper is not specifically limited. Specific examples thereof include electron beam lithography method and laser beam interference method. For example, a mold with a nano concave-convex structure can be obtained by applying a suitable photoresist coating on a suitable supporting substrate, by exposing it by a light such as an ultra-violet ray laser, an electron ray or an X-ray, and by develop it. The mold can be just used as a stamper, but the nano concave-convex structure can also be formed directly on the supporting substrate itself by selectively etching the supporting substrate through a photoresist layer by dry etching to remove a resist layer.
[0098] Also, an anodized porous alumina can be used as the stamper. For example, a porous structure of 20 to 200 nm which is formed by anodize aluminum at a predetermined voltage using oxalic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or the like as an electrolyte may be used as the stamper. According to this method, a pore with very high regularity can self-organizationally be formed by anodizing high purity aluminum for a long time at a constant voltage and thereafter by removing the oxide film once, and by anodizing it again. Further, by connecting the anodizing treatment with a pore-enlarging treatment in the second anodizing step, the nano concave-convex structure whose section is not a rectangular but a triangle or a bell shape can be formed. Also, by appropriately adjusting the time and condition of the anodizing treatment and the pore-enlarging treatment, the angle of the innermost part of the pore can be sharpened.
[0099] Further, a replicated mold was produced from an original mold having a nano concave-convex structure and it can be used as the stamper.
[0100] The shape of the stamper itself is not specifically limited, and the stamper may be a flat plate, a belt or a roll. In particular, if it is a belt or a roll, the nano concave-convex structure can continuously transferred and the productivity can further be improved.
