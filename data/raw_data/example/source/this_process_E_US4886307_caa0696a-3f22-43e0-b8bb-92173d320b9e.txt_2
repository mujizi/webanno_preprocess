The aforementioned tensioning lever 149 and the push lever jointly form a two-part charging lever 160.
The manner of operation of this lock which concerns the sixth embodiment is as follows:
In accordance with FIGS. 21 and 22, the hood 102 assumes its open position. The force accumulator K is in its discharged position. The piston-rod end of the gas pressure spring 141 rests thereby via the locking tooth 132 of the pull lever 131 against the locking shoulder 133 of the release member 134. If the hinged part is now moved, starting from its open position, into the closed position, the eye 159 of the hood 102 swings around the hinge axle 103. Along with this, the tensioning lever 149 is displaced via the core 156 of the Bowden cable 157 and charges the force accumulator via the push lever 147 which assumes the tensioning position, in accordance with the position shown in FIG. 23. Shortly before reaching the closed position of the hinged part, the pivot pin 146 between the force accumulator K and push lever 147 moves over the dead center line T-T which passes through the pivot pin 139 and the transverse pin 148--see FIG. 23--so that the force accumulator is prevented from expanding on both ends. During the further course of the closing movement, the mating closure part 104 extends into the fork mouth 108 of the fork latch 105 and effects a swinging thereof in clockwise direction against the spring load. In this process, the fork latch tail 112 acts on the run-on bevel 137 of the release member 134 which, in this connection, moves away in opposition to spring load in the manner that its locking shoulder 133 comes out of the plane of movement of the locking tooth 132 of the pull lever 131. The force accumulator K can now, via the pull lever 131, swing the fork latch 105 in clockwise direction, the mating closure part 104 being pulled in via the fork mouth 108 while closing the hood, which then enters into a position of sealing contact with a sealing strip (not shown) in known manner. After the piston rod 140 of the gas pressure spring is fully extended, the locking tooth 119 has passed through the pre-detent recess 110 and has extended into the main detent recess 111 of the fork latch and thus blocks the return rotation of the fork latch 105; see FIG. 24.
The push lever 147, in this position, maintains its tensioning position by its stop 151 resting against the facing narrow edge 152 of the tensioning lever 149. Furthermore, in this position the pivot pin 146 is in a position beyond the dead center position.
The opening of the hinged part presupposes actuation of the connecting rod 130. By pulling on it, the position shown in FIG. 25 is reached. In this connection it is so acted upon by the release lever 125 of the push lever 147 that its pivot pin 146 which leads to the force accumulator K has gone beyond the dead center line T-T and come into the other beyond-dead-center position. This release requires only a slight expenditure of force. In this way the force accumulator K is displaced in the direction of the charging lever 160 via the tension spring 144 which acts on the pull lever 131, the push lever 147 being positively swung against its spring action into the position shown in FIG. 25 in which the stop 151 on the other side of the transverse pin 148 rests against the corresponding narrow edge 152. During this return displacement of the pull lever 131, its locking tooth 132 has moved in latch-like manner over the rounded edge 161 in front of the run-on bevel 137 and has then again come in front of the locking shoulder 133 of the spring-loaded release member 134. The hinged part 102 can now be moved into the open position, in which connection the fork latch is swung into its basic position, shown in FIGS. 21 and 22, via the mating closure part 104 and, in addition, by spring load, in which position it lies with its latch tail 112 in front of the run-on bevel 137. During this movement the release member 134 moves away against the spring load in accordance with the dash-dot line showing in FIG. 24. Furthermore, during the opening movement of the hinged part 102, the eye 159 shifts such that the Bowden cable 157 permits the swinging of the tensioning lever 149, in which connection the push lever 147 swings, superimposed, from the position according to FIG. 25 into the tensioned position according to FIGS. 21 and 22. After release of the connecting rod 130, the release lever 125 and the locking pawl also return into their basic position, so that upon a renewed closing of the hinged part, the process described above is repeated.
