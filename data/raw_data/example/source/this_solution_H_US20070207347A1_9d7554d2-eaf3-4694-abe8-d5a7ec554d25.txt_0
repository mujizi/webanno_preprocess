[0258] Compound (3), eq. 1, was prepared in the following manner. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, acetylenic compound (2) (2.0 g, 12 mMole), was dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) (100 mL) and the solution cool to 0.degree. C. Potassium t-butoxide (KBu.sup.tO) (1.4 g, 12 mMole), was added and the mixture stirred well for approximately 15 minutes. To this mixture was then added the benzophenone (1) (3.53 g, 30 mMole). Stirring was continued at 0.degree. C. for approximately 30 minutes and then allowed to come to room temperature over a 1-hour period. At the end of this time the solution was cooled to 0.degree. C. and the reaction treated with saturated sodium chloride (20 mL). The mixture was then diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with 2N-HCl (3 times), dried over MgSO.sub.4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was triturated with petroleum ether to give the product as an off-white solid. The yield of compound (3) was 3.0 g.
[0259] Compound (3) (7.0 g, 15 mMole) was dissolved in methylene chloride (CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2) (70 mL), and stirred at 0.degree. C. under a nitrogen atmosphere. To this solution was added triethylamine (NEt.sub.3) (1.56 g, 15 mMole) and then the mixture was treated drop by drop with methanesulfonyl chloride (CH.sub.3SO.sub.2Cl) (1.92 g, 15 mMole), keeping the temperature of the reaction in the range 0-5.degree. C. After the addition, the solution was stirred at 0.degree. C. for 30 minutes, and then allowed to warm to room temperature over 1 hour. The reaction was then heated to reflux, distilling off the methylene chloride solvent. The methylene chloride solvent was gradually replaced by adding xylenes (a total of 70 mL). When the internal temperature of the reaction reached 80.degree. C., collidine (2.40 g, 19.82 mMole), dissolved in xylenes (10 mL) was added drop by drop over a 10-minute period. The temperature was then raised to 110.degree. C. and held at this temperature for 4 hours. After this period the reaction was cooled and concentrated under reduced pressure. The oily residue was stirred with methanol (70 mL) to give the crude product. This material was filtered off, washed with methanol and petroleum ether to give compound Cpd-2 as a bright red solid. The yield was 1.5 g and Cpd-2 had a melting point of 300-305.degree. C. The product may be further purified by sublimation (250.degree. C. @ 200 millitorr) with a N.sub.2 carrier gas.
