[0002] The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for evaporative cooling of a cooling fluid. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for evaporative cooling of a cooling fluid, which is capable of considerably reducing the volume of an evaporative cooler such as a cooling tower by cooling a cooling fluid to a lower temperature, which has been heated due to heat exchange as it circulated in an apparatus to be cooled in a cooling tower or an indoor or outdoor unit of a general air conditioner, etc.
[0003] 2. Description of the Related Art
[0004] In cooling systems, a cooling fluid takes heat away from an apparatus to be cooled by absorbing heat from the apparatus as it circulates therein. The cooling fluid heated by this process is cooled by releasing heat through a cooling process such as evaporative cooling and then it is re-circulated to the apparatus to be cooled.
[0005] Herein, the device for cooling the heated cooling fluid and re-circulating the cooling fluid in the apparatus to be cooled is installed on rooftops of buildings. The device is constituted of an evaporative cooler which evaporatively cools the cooling fluid having been heated circulating the apparatus to be cooled.
[0006] A cooling tower is one general example of such evaporative coolers.
