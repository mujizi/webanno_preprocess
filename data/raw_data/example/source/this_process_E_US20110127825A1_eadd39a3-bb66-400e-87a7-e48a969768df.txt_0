[0026] The present invention addresses one or more of the issues concerning previous in-situ solution mining systems and methods, particularly for in-situ solution mining of trona beds, more particularly for in-situ solution mining of virgin trona beds.
[0027] Systems and methods according to the present invention relate to the in situ solution mining of an ore bed containing a desired solute in a manner effective to dissolve the desired solute in a solvent while preventing or limiting contact of the ore roof with the solvent and thereby eliminate the potential contamination by undesirable (inorganic and/or organic) solutes through dissolution of roof material. For example, in the case of trona mining, the method thereby reduces or even eliminates the potential contamination by undesirable chloride and/or solvent-soluble organic compounds.
[0028] In the case of mining of trona bed, the in situ solution mining method for trona mining according to the present invention generally uses a solvent in unlined borehole portion(s) positioned in a very large trona bed to dissolve the base of such trona bed in a manner effective to systematically undercut the trona bed making it susceptible to gravitational loading and crushing. The solvent dissolves the crushed trona and carries away dissolved trona which in turn creates a voided space (undercut) for more trona material to move into the voided space and be exposed to the solvent for dissolution. This process creates a large amount of trona surface area needed for meaningful production levels without the requirement of initial mechanical mining. By controlling the flow of solvent in a precise way, the entire trona block is eventually dissolved away from the floor up to the roof or up to proximity of the roof. Applicants thereby define such method as an in situ `undercut` solution mining method. The undercut formation may travel in a bed with a dip gradient as the mining operation progresses, for example in a retreating mode as the undercut is initially formed down-dip at the base of the ore bed and continues to be formed in the up-dip direction, or in an advancing mode as the undercut is initially formed up-dip at the base of the trona bed, and continues to be formed in the down-dip direction. Since there is a migration of the undercut formation alongside the initial unlined boreholes or portions thereof over time, Applicants thus call this method, a `traveling` undercut solution mining method.
[0029] For the mining of trona bed, the undercut solution mining method not only enables formation of a `free face` in a trona ore bed and allows gravity to assist in the development of large amount of trona bed surface area for dissolution, but also prevents or minimizes chloride contamination of the liquor which can occur through contact with the roof rock.
[0030] A first embodiment according to the present invention relates to a method for in situ undercut solution mining of a subterranean ore bed, the ore bed comprising a desired solute being selected from the group consisting of sodium sesquicarbonate, sodium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate, said ore bed having a floor and a roof, the method comprising the following steps: [0031] injecting a solvent comprising water through an unlined borehole portion, said unlined borehole portion comprising a downhole end positioned within said ore bed and above said bed floor, said unlined borehole portion being horizontal or being slanted with one of its ends being at a higher elevation than the other end, in order to expose to the solvent an ore region within said unlined borehole portion or adjacent to said downhole end of said unlined borehole portion; [0032] dissolving at least a portion of the desired solute, from said solvent-exposed ore region in a manner effective to form a liquor comprising said dissolved desired solute, and to further form an undercut above the bed floor, said undercut comprising at least a section of said unlined borehole portion which has been eroded by dissolution; [0033] repeating the solvent injection to dissolve additional desired solute from the ore thereby enriching the liquor in desired solute, and further in a manner effective to widen the undercut and to trigger the fracture of unexposed ore disposed above said undercut and the downward movement of fractured ore rubble by gravity into the undercut, while allowing the ore roof to sag but not to break and preventing exposure of said solvent to chloride-containing material located at or above the ore roof so as to minimize chloride contamination of the liquor; and [0034] flowing the liquor towards a subterranean collection zone in order to pass said liquor to a terrain location.
