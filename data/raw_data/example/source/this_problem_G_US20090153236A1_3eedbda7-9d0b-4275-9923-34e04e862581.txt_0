[0003] A smartcard (hereinafter also referred to as card for short) is typically a device with a "credit card" sized form factor having a small embedded electronic functional circuit, for instance, a computer chip or the like. Such a card-computer may be programmed to perform tasks and/or to store information. In general, there are different types of smartcards, e.g. memory cards, processor cards, electronic purse cards, security cards etc. Nowadays, a smartcard with a processor circuit is usually adapted to be inserted into a so-called smartcard reader, also commonly called card terminal, and is then available for use. Software wishing to communicate with the reader needs to send some commands to control the reader, to provide functions, such as powering up or transferring commands to the smartcard. Commands sent to smartcards may be proprietary, but there is also a standard, namely the ISO 7816 specifications, which define command formats in great detail.
[0004] Smartcards help businesses evolve and expand their products and services in a rapidly changing global market. In addition to the well known commercial applications, for instance, banking, payments, access control, identification, ticketing and parking or toll collection etc., in recent years, the information age has introduced an array of security and privacy issues that have called for advanced smartcard security applications, e.g. secure log on and authentication of users to PC and networks, storage of digital certificates, passwords and credentials, encryption of sensitive data, wireless communication subscriber authentication, etc.
[0005] The newest generation of smartcards is developed for autonomous operation without a card terminal, i.e. a card-reader as described above. Thus, such a card requires an internal power source for operation. However, due to the dimensions of smartcards the power that can be made available inside the card is very small. Typically, the capacity of an internal power supply is in the order of 10 to 25 mAh. The common use profile of smartcards is short operation times, for instance 20 seconds, and about five operations per day with long time intervals of no operation in between. It goes without saying that it is crucial for the acceptance of such autonomous smartcards to be usable for several years without having to be exchanged for reason of a depleted battery. Even if recharging of the internal battery would be possible it could be forgotten and thus harm user acceptance. Hence, it is necessary to ensure a predetermined period of time during which enough "on board" power can be guaranteed. Since the total power available is so small it is very much desirable to have a minimum power usage, when the card is not used. Even a low rest current of 1 .mu.A will consume 26 mAh over a period of 3 years. Considering an internal battery of 25 mAh, the power would not even be sufficient for a period of no operation of 3 years. However, this problem can not easily be solved by a larger battery, since the area of the card that is taken up by the battery is important. A smaller battery leaves more room for other components on the card and/or more room for "plastic" providing a better mechanical behaviour of the card.
[0006] There are two common approaches to reduce power loss, each having their own disadvantages. First, when the power supply to a functional circuit is maintained, i.e. the power supply is not switched off; the rest current drawn (?) by the total system then should at least be below 0.1 .mu.A. However, this is not possible for the current generation of integrated circuits (IC) that are applied in smartcards. The most advanced low-power IC's are currently going to approach this kind of rest power. But even with a rest current in the order of 0.1 .mu.A, 25% of the capacity of a 10 mAh battery is wasted in a 3 year time period. Therefore, the rest current should be preferably below 0.01 .mu.A.
[0007] A second alternative is the use of an analog switch to disconnect the power supply, e.g. the battery, from the functional circuit, e.g. a processor. For instance, the processor may generate a signal that the power should be disconnected when it powers down. This solution usually consists of a number of transistors and has the drawback that the total leakage current of the transistors is too large. Moreover, in the known circuits, the transistor as a switching element within the power line has a significant on-resistance of several tens of Ohms, which additionally reduces the voltage that can be used for the supplied functional circuit. The simplest known circuit for switching the connection to the power supply is shown in FIG. 8. By a high signal at (I), transistor V2 opens and pulls the gate of transistor V1 to ground, thus causing transistor V1 to switch to conduction. At a low signal (I), transistor V2 closes and the pull-up resistor R brings the gate of transistor V1 to a high voltage, which closes transistor V1. This circuit can be recognized, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,198,851 in FIG. 12, where transistor V2 corresponds to FET 36 and the rest of the circuit, i.e. at least transistor V1, is in the DC/DC converter. In the circuit of FIG. 8, in the on-state of the supplied circuit, the resistor R consumes most power. Considering that realistic resistor values are 100 k to 1 M, the power usage is 3 to 30 .mu.A at a supply voltage of 3 V, which is significant for very low power applications like the devices discussed herein, such as smartcards, transponders etc. In the power-offstate, in the circuit of FIG. 8, power usage is governed by the leakage current of the two transistors V1 and V2.
