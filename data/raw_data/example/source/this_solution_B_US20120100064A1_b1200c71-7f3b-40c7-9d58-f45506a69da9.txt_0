[0132] Next, with moisture being left by not through a dry process, a solid content concentration was adjusted (by a purification process) to be 10 wt % (the first embodiment), thereby producing a magnetic material slurry (hereinafter, referred to as .di-elect cons.-Al.sub.0.5Fe.sub.1.5O.sub.3 water slurry) containing spherical .di-elect cons.-Al.sub.0.5Fe.sub.1.5O.sub.3 particles.
(3-4-2) First Example
[0133] Next, the .di-elect cons.E-Al.sub.0.5Fe.sub.1.5O.sub.3 water slurry of 10 wt % and a PEG 500000 aqueous solution of 10 wt % were mixed together at a ratio by weight of 1:1. Water was added in this solution, and the addition of water was terminated when the solution viscosity became 56 cP, and the solution was taken as a coating liquid. A PET film as a film-formation target was subjected to a so-called bar-coating by this coating liquid, and immediately dried for substantially 30 minutes at a room temperature in a superconducting magnet with an external magnetic field of 2 T, thereby producing a magnetic thin film.
[0134] Thereafter, the magnetization of a magnetic material of the first example having the magnetic thin film formed in this manner was measured by an SQUID (superconducting quantum interference flux meter). As a result, according to the first example, as shown in a following table 1, the squareness ratio M.sub.r/M.sub.s that is a ratio of a residual magnetization M.sub.r relative to a saturated magnetization M.sub.s was 0.73.
