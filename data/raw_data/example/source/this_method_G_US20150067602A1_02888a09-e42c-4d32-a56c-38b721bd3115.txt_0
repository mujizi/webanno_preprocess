Selecting User Interface Objects
[0236] Many electronic devices have graphical user interfaces that display user interface objects such as thumbnails, icons, folders, and thumb/handles in scrubbers and slider bar on a display. Such user interface items generally represent either a file or a directory (or sub-directory) corresponding to a collection of files. Often, a user of an electronic device will want to select and move user interface objects on the display. For example, a user will want to rearrange desktop items in a desktop environment/window system. As another example, a user may want to select several user interface objects and add the selected user interface object to a collection of user interface objects. Such operations occur, for example, while using a desktop environment (e.g., adding files to a folder), or between a desktop environment and an application (e.g., adding files from a desktop window to a play list in a media player), or within an application (e.g., selecting and dragging user interface items within a media player). As yet another example, a user may want to rearrange the order of thumbnails corresponding to applications, or "apps" displayed on the display of a portable multifunction device.
[0237] Some methods of selecting user interface objects on electronic devices with touch-sensitive surfaces typically require performing a distinct selection operation on each of a plurality of a user interface objects (e.g., activating a mouse button or placing a contact on a touch-sensitive surface) to individually select the user interface objects. Typically, in such embodiments, in order to perform a subsequent selection operation a user first ceases to select a previously selected object (e.g., a previously selected user interface object is deselected when the mouse button is deactivated or the contact is lifted off of the touch-sensitive surface). Thus, in these examples, selection of a second user interface object (e.g., another desktop item) requires a separate selection operation and consequently only one user interface object is selected at a time. Alternatively, some methods enable a user to select multiple user interface an area to select multiple user interface objects, however this method of selecting objects does not enable a user to a specific set of user interface objects from a group of user interface objects that are located in close proximity to each other. The embodiments described below provide a more efficient, intuitive method, implemented on an electronic device with a touch-sensitive surface, for determining whether to select a user interface object, or forgo selecting a user interface object, based on an intensity of a contact with the touch-sensitive surface. In some circumstances, multiple user interface objects are selected using a single, continuous contact or, alternative, multiple distinct contacts on the touch-sensitive surface.
[0238] FIGS. 8A-8DD illustrate exemplary user interfaces for selecting user interface objects in accordance with some embodiments. The user interfaces in these figures are used to illustrate the processes described below, including the processes in FIGS. 9A-9E. For figures that illustrate a contact with a touch-sensitive surface, an intensity diagram is included that shows the current intensity of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface relative to a plurality of intensity thresholds including an alternative-mode intensity threshold (e.g., "IT.sub.D") and a selection intensity threshold (e.g., "IT.sub.L").
[0239] In some embodiments, the device is portable multifunction device 100, the display is touch-sensitive display system 112, and the touch-sensitive surface includes tactile output generators 167 on the display (FIG. 1A). For convenience of explanation, the embodiments described with reference to FIGS. 8A-8DD and FIGS. 9A-9E will be discussed with reference to display 450 and a separate touch-sensitive surface 451, however analogous operations are, optionally, performed on a device with a touch-sensitive display system 112 in response to detecting the contacts described in FIGS. 8A-8DD on the touch-sensitive display system 112 while displaying the user interfaces shown in FIGS. 8A-8DD on the touch-sensitive display system 112; in such embodiments, the focus selector is, optionally: a respective contact, a representative point corresponding to a contact (e.g., a centroid of a respective contact or a point associated with a respective contact), or a centroid of two or more contacts detected on the touch-sensitive display system 112, in place of cursor 17408.
