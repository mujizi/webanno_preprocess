[0014] In the presently shown example, the diffusion region 72 is connected to a bitline through a bitline contact 76, or other line for sensing a current from the polysilicon gate 66, and can be doped to accommodate programming voltages or currents. This diffusion region 72 is formed proximate to the thick oxide portion of the variable thickness gate oxide 62. To further protect the edge of anti-fuse device 60 from high voltage damage, or current leakage, a resistor protection oxide (RPO), also known as a salicide protect oxide, can be introduced during the fabrication process to further space metal particles from the edge of sidewall spacer 68. This RPO is preferably used during the salicidation process for preventing only a portion of diffusion region 72 and a portion of polysilicon gate 66 from being salicided. It is well known that salicided transistors are known to have higher leakage and therefore lower breakdown voltage. Thus having a non-salicided diffusion region 72 will reduce leakage. Diffusion region 72 can be doped for low voltage transistors or high voltage transistors or a combination of the two resulting in same or different diffusion profiles.
[0015] Once again, it is desirable to minimize the Vt of the anti-fuse device defined by the portion of the polysilicon gate 66 over the thin gate oxide portion of the variable thickness gate oxide 62. Therefore it is formed using an LV transistor process. As shown in FIG. 5 by example, the anti-fuse device consisting of polysilicon gate 66 over the thin gate oxide portion is formed in a low voltage p-type well PWELL-LV 78 that has a dopant concentration, a Vt implant and gate oxide thickness specifically set for an LV transistor. The access gate consisting of polysilicon gate 66 over the thick gate oxide portion of the variable thickness gate oxide 62 is formed in a high voltage p-type well PWELL-HV 80 that has a dopant concentration, a Vt implant and a gate oxide thickness specifically set for an HV transistor. Therefore the Vt of the anti-fuse device will be the same as the Vt of a core circuit transistor.
[0016] Unfortunately, foundries for manufacturing semiconductor devices may have set types of LV transistor processes for manufacturing core circuits of the memory device, where the Vt control implant differs depending on the circuit application or function. Semiconductor memory devices generally have three circuit areas. First are the I/O circuits that are connected to pins of the package of the semiconductor memory device. Second are the core circuits, which include any logic and control circuits for example. Third is the memory array, which includes memory cells. Compounding this problem is the fact that the anti-fuse is typically designed on the basis of a particular LV transistor process, which means that the anti-fuse device has been qualified to operate properly if manufactured according to that particular LV transistor process. If the foundry does not have an LV transistor process suited for the design, then redesign of the anti-fuse device is required in order to qualify it for the available process. Such redesign incurs significant cost overhead, which is necessitated again when the foundry introduces a new generation of the process to accommodate a new manufacturing technology node. For example, an LV process for a 45 nm technology node may be different than that of a 20 nm technology node.
[0017] Another important issue is reliability of the anti-fuse memory device, and more specifically the quality of the thin gate oxide. The thin gate oxide quality is affected by the condition of the underlying channel surface, the concentration and uniformity of dopants at the channel surface, and implantation damage, just to name a few factors. Generally, the more process steps that the anti-fuse device is subjected to, the higher the probability for producing a defective anti-fuse device. Since anti-fuse based memory devices are programmed after manufacture by end-users, it is difficult to test for the reliability of an anti-fuse device before programming. Therefore the quality of the thin gate oxide should be maximized, since an inadvertently programmed anti-fuse device or an unprogrammable anti-fuse device will likely cause failure in the system. In the automotive industry, such a failure can have catastrophic consequences.
[0018] As device features continue to decrease in size, minimization of leakage current becomes even more important. FIGS. 4 and 5 are examples of typical OTP cells fabricated on wells of similar type. Although they are improvements over earlier structures, the fabrication process still has it challenges. The use of Vt adjust implants are required to address minimization of leakage currents. However, Vt adjust implants increase the number of process steps the memory cell is exposed to. This increase in the number of process steps exposes the memory cells to a higher probability of reliability issues. These structures also exhibit sensitivities to mask alignment issues where it would affect the functionality or reliability of the device. Finally, the differences of Vt processes between the different foundries and process nodes pose problems requiring memory cell redesigns.
