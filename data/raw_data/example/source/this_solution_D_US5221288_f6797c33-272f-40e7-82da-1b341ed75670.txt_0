Tinuvin 326, 2 parts
150 parts of water, 7.5 parts of urea, and 20 parts of 37% formalin were mixed. This mixture was adjusted to a pH of 8 with 10% sodium carbonate and stirred at 70.degree. C. for 1 hour to yield an aqueous solution containing an initial condensation product of urea and formamide.
Then, to this solution, a thermally dissolved mixture of the formulation described above was added dropwise with stirring, and stirring was continued at a stirring rate adjusted so that the grain diameter of this mixture became about 5 .mu.m. Citric acid was added dropwise to adjust the solution to a pH of 5, and the solution was stirred at 70.degree. C. for 2 hours. Citric acid was further added dropwise to adjust the solution to a pH of 3, and the solution was stirred at 80.degree. C. for 2 hours, followed by washing with water, filtration and drying to yield about 40 parts of thermochromic microcapsules.
Next, 25 parts of the microcapsules described above were added to 100 parts of 2% by weight carboxymethyl cellulose, and this mixture was stirred to yield a uniform dispersion.
To this dispersion, 100 parts of 2% polyvinyl alcohol was added. After the temperature was increased to 40.degree. C., 100 parts of 25% sodium chloride was gradually added with stirring, and the solution was subsequently cooled to 10.degree. C., and 50% glutaraldehyde was added with additional stirring, followed by stirring for 15 hours.
