2. Xylitol, included in compositions 12 and 13, also serves as an adhesive.
3. The distilled water referred to in compositions 10 and 11, and the second mentioned quantity of distilled water referred to in compositions 12 and 13, serves as a plasticiser for the salbutanol. The first mentioned quantity of distilled water in compositions 12 and 13 serves as a solvent for the xylitol.
4. In the case of compositions 1 to 11, salbutamol alone, or with an adhesive, was dissolved in ethanol, and this solution was sprayed onto the glass balls rotating in a coating pan by means of a hand-held spray gun. The coated balls were dried at 40.degree. C. by means of a hot-air blower. In the case of compositions 12 and 13, the solution of xylitol in distilled water was sprayed onto the balls before the solution of salbutamol and adhesive was similarly applied.
The solvent used for applying a film of active substance to the balls or orbital path will of course depend on the nature of the active substance. For example, where the active substance is beclomethasone dipropionate the solvent may be chloroform, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, acetone, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate or methyl isobutyl ketone.
