[0002] Conductive adhesives often provide a convenient and useful way to bond and electrically connect electrode pads on separate circuits or between layers of a multiple layer circuit. When many independent electrode pads exist in a relatively small area, it is useful to employ an anisotropic conductive adhesive, also known as a z-axis conductive adhesive. An anisotropic conductive adhesive allows conduction between opposing electrodes through the adhesive, but does not allow conduction in the plane of the adhesive. Thus, adjacent electrode pads meant to conduct independently can remain electrically isolated from each other while being bonded and electrically connected to partner electrodes on opposing circuits or circuit layers.
[0003] One method of making a conductive adhesive involves dispersing conductive particles randomly in an adhesive layer. The adhesive so formed is placed between circuit layers that are then properly aligned. When the circuit layers are pressed together, the conductive particles disposed between the pairs of opposing electrodes make contact with the electrode pads. Single particles may contact both the upper and lower electrode, or contact may be made through a series of particles creating a vertically conductive pathway through the adhesive layer. Additionally, the adhesive itself mechanically bonds the circuit layers and insulates the conductive particles so that adjacent electrodes do not electrically short. An example of such an adhesive is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,113,981 (Fujita et al.).
[0004] Difficulties arise when higher density connections are desired. Higher density connections involve smaller spacings between electrodes as well as smaller electrode pads. Using z-axis conductive adhesives to connect such "fine pitch" circuits can lead to electrical shorts between adjacent electrodes. As the distance between adjacent electrodes approaches the average spacing between conductive particles in the adhesive, isolated groups of contacting conductive particles (either "clusters"--groups having a vertical dimension, or "strings"--horizontal groups) can bridge the gap between adjacent electrodes, thereby shorting the circuit. One solution to this problem is to use a lower loading volume of conductive particles in the adhesive. However, in so doing, the reliability of electrode connections may suffer due to the existence of fewer particles per connection, especially in cases where very small electrode pads are used. Fewer conductive particles also increases the resistance of the circuit connection and decreases its current carrying capacity. In addition, reducing the particle loading volume does not completely address the problem of shorting due to particle grouping.
[0005] One technique to combat shorting is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,180,888 (Sugiyama). In that case, conductive particles were provided with a non-conductive coating and dispersed in an adhesive. In this way, particle strings will not form conductive pathways. Instead, the only particles that will conduct are those particles sandwiched between opposing electrodes which are pressed together with enough force to crack the non-conductive coating.
[0006] Conductive particles have also been supplied in a two-layer adhesive system where one layer contains particles and the other layer is free of particles. This method was described in an article by Watanabe et al. entitled "Anisotropic Conductive Adhesive Films for Flip-Chip Interconnection," Proceedings of the 9.sup.th International Microelectronics Conference (Japan, 1996). During circuit layer bonding, the particles between electrodes are sandwiched by the electrodes, thus making electrical contact, while the excess adhesive from the particle-free second adhesive layer is pushed out from between the electrodes and acts to clear particles out of the areas where shorts may occur. However, particle strings can still form in this method due to the random particle dispersion in the first adhesive layer, and thus shorts can still occur.
