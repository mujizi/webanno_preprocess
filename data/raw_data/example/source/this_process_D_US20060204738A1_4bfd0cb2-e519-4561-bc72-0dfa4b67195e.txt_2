Synthesis of Nanowires on Nitinol Substrate
[0402] Following removal of organic residue from the Nitinol substrate surface (e.g., the surface is plasma cleaned with oxygen to remove any organics on the surface), the substrate is then placed in a CVD furnace in which it undergoes an approximate 30 minute run at approximately 480.degree. C. to give a 6 to 10 nanometer conformal layer of microcrystalline silicon. The silicon coated material is then coated with an organic, chemical solution such as polylysine to ensure that the silicon surface is positively charged so that the gold colloid will adhere to the silicon coated surface. After the polylysine has been coated to the silicon coated surface, a liquid solution of gold colloid is deposited on the substrate for use as a catalyst within the subsequent chemical vapor deposition step. Selection of the colloid diameter is chosen based on the desired wire diameter size. The negatively charged gold colloid adheres to the positively charged surface. After gold colloid deposition, the material is then plasma cleaned to remove organics such as polylysine. Finally, the material is run thru the CVD furnace using CVD to create silicon nanowire structures from gold. During this process anisotropic crystal growth was promoted by the presence of liquid alloy/solid interface. The decomposition of silane (SiH.sub.4) and gold form a liquid alloy, when the temperature is higher than the eutectic point. This "liquid" surface then becomes the preferred deposition site for incoming silicon vapor. After the liquid alloy becomes supersaturated with silicon, nanowire growth occurs by precipitation at the solid-liquid interface.
