However, drilling out iron components requires certain techniques. Ideally, the operator employs variations in rotary speed and bit weight to help break up the metal parts and reestablish bit penetration should bit penetration cease while drilling. A phenomenon known as "bit tracking" can occur, wherein the drill bit stays on one path and no longer cuts into the downhole tool. When this happens, it is necessary to pick up the bit above the drilling surface and rapidly recontact the bit with the packer or plug and apply weight while continuing rotation. This aids in breaking up the established bit pattern and helps to reestablish bit penetration. If this procedure is used, there are rarely problems. However, operators may not apply these techniques or even recognize when bit tracking has occurred. The result is that drilling times are greatly increased because the bit merely wears against the surface of the downhole tool rather than cutting into it to break it up.
While cast iron components may be necessary for the high pressures and temperatures for which they are designed, it has been determined that many wells experience pressures less than 10,000 psi and temperatures less than 425.degree. F. This includes most wells cemented. In fact, in the majority of wells, the pressure is less than about 5,000 psi, and the temperature is less than about 250.degree. F. Thus, the heavy duty metal construction of the previous downhole tools, such as the packers and bridge plugs described above, is not necessary for many applications, and if cast iron components can be eliminated or minimized, the potential drilling problems resulting from bit tracking might be avoided as well.
Some embodiments of the downhole tool of the present invention solve this problem by providing an apparatus wherein at least some of the components, including pressure bearing components, are made of non-metallic materials, such as engineering grade plastics. Such plastic components are much more easily drilled than cast iron, and new drilling methods may be employed which use alternative drill bits such as polycrystalline diamond compact bits, or the like, rather than standard tri-cone bits.
The Halliburton EZ Drill SV.RTM. squeeze packer has a pressure balance sliding valve for control of fluid movement in the well. The valve is disposed in a center mandrel of the packer. The valve is operated by reciprocation of the tubing, and may be opened and closed, as desired, before and after squeeze cementing. Some of the embodiments of the present invention also utilize a sliding valve within the mandrel, but differ in the use of non-metallic components.
Although the EZ Drill SV.RTM. configuration with the valve disposed in the mandrel has worked well, it does require machine work on the inside of the mandrel. This would also be true on the non-metallic embodiments disclosed herein. Of course, any machining adds to the cost of the components. Also, the valve itself which slides inside the mandrel reduces the flow area through the packer, thus causing at least some restriction to the inside of the packer mandrel. Thus, there is a need for a downhole tool, such as a packer, with less flow restriction therethrough and one in which the inner surface of the mandrel requires no machining. Further, in order to operate a packer of the EZ Drill SV.RTM. configuration, it is necessary to run a stinger into the tool to actuate the valve. In some wells, proper insertion of the stinger may be difficult, and therefore elimination of the need for a stinger is desirable in these cases.
