[0108] An exemplary method of using a primary access device (first elongate medical device 10), a wire guide 11, and a secondary access device (third elongated medical device 44) of the present invention to access and perform a medical operation in a work site 41 is depicted in FIGS. 9a-f. The initial steps of the illustrative method include a standard endoscopic technique for accessing the biliary duct 41 to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. FIG. 9a shows a duodenoscope 38 that has been introduced via the oral cavity into the duodenum 39 to visualize the Papilla of Vater 40 and Sphincter of Oddi, which lie at the opening to the common bile duct 41 and the pancreatic duct. In the exemplary method, a dilator catheter 88 and wire guide 11 are advanced from the accessory channel of the scope 38 to cannulate a stricture 42 within the work site 41 (duct). It is general physician preference that determines whether the wire guide 11 is advanced past the tip of the primary access device 10 to assist in cannulation or whether the distal end 25 of the wire guide is within the passageway 27 during this part of the procedure. As depicted in FIG. 9b, the dilator catheter 10 (or other secondary access device) is advanced over the wire guide 11 with the proximal portion of the wire guide exiting the side access port 15 and extending through the channel alongside the catheter so that both separately exit the accessory channel of the scope as depicted in FIG. 12. For applications where the size of the scope channel is restricted or other applications where there is limited room to accommodate both devices side by side, the catheter can be modified to allow for the wire guide to lie alongside without increasing the overall diameter. This can be done by forming an open channel (preferably one that would not capture the wire) or creating a flattened longitudinal portion along the length of the catheter (not shown).
[0109] Still referring to FIG. 12, the proximal portion 59 of the wire guide 11 is typically, but not necessarily, secured in place once the distal end 25 thereof has been advanced to the desired position within the work site 41. The illustrative wire guide holder 50 represents an improvement over prior art devices in that it is configured to be partially inserted into or over the opening 52 of the access port 51 to the accessory channel and provide a seal, rather than being secured elsewhere on the scope. The holder 50 further includes an optional integrated sealing element 65 having one or more types of seals, including duckbill, membrane with slit (e.g., polystyrene, silicone, or another compliant polymer material), foam seal with small central aperture (e.g., silicon, polyurethane, etc.), or other designs having the ability to seal around the catheter and wire guide to prevent any proximally migrating fluid from exiting the channel. The wire guide 11 is locked in place by interweaving it through a first series of spaces 53 (or channels, grooves, slots, etc) between spaced elements located along one side of a locking portion 66 of the device, such as the illustrative curved `spine`, using an alternating under/over manner as depicted. The illustrative holder includes three slots 53 or spaces on the first side and a second series of three slots 54 or spaces on the opposite side of the locking portion 66 to accommodate a second wire, if one is necessary for the procedure.
[0110] Unlike other wire guide exchange procedures where the proximal end of the wire guide is well out of the way of the physician, the short wires typically used in the illustrative remote uncoupling or ultra-short wire techniques usually result in the proximal end of the wire guide being within the physician's working area so that access thereto is readily available for introducing secondary devices to the work site. While the illustrative holder is configured to direct the proximal end portion of the wire guide downward and out of the way of the physician, the proximal end, when unsecured to feed another device over the wire, may deflect back up into the working area around the access port of the scope and can interfere with the physician during the procedure. To help alleviate this problem, FIG. 7 depicts a wire guide 11 in which the proximal end portion 59 thereof is oriented at an angle 79 with respect to the distal and intermediate portions of the wire so that the proximal end 58/proximal end portion 59 is typically oriented down and away from the operator (when rotated as such) and thus, out of the working area surrounding the access port of the endoscope while still allowing the physician to access the proximal end for the advancing the next device. In the illustrative embodiment, which comprises an 185 cm nitinol core wire guide 11 in which approximately 40-45 cm thereof typically is extending proximally out of the scope as the third elongate medical device is being advanced thereover, the bend 80 or point of deflection is preferably located about 20-30 cm from the proximal end, although the useful range may be anywhere from 0-50 cm. The useful angle 79 of deflection depends on physician preference, the configuration of the scope and wire guide holder, and other factors, but is generally about 30-120.degree. for endoscopic procedures with a more preferred range of 45-90.degree. for the illustrative embodiment. To create the bend 80 in a nitinol wire guide 11, the material can either be heat set or mechanically overstressed (`cold working`) to achieve the desired angle 79 of deflection and radius of the bend 80 (e.g., small, relatively acute bend or a large, more gradual or rounded bend).
[0111] Referring now to FIG. 9c, once the wire guide has been advanced to the desired location within the work site, the catheter is advanced or drawn back over the wire guide to position it for performing the intended operation. In the illustrative method, this involves the injection of contrast media 43 into the duct 41 to visualize the obstruction, which comprises a stricture 42 in this particular instance. Another common alternative approach to diagnosing potential obstructions in the ducts would be to initially introduce a sphincterotome 32 (FIG. 10) to inject contrast media 43. If an obstruction is found, such as a stone, the sphincter might be ablated and a second device, such as a basket or balloon, is introduced over the original wire guide to extract the stone from the duct. A variety of other treatment possibilities exist and thus, it should be understood that the nature and sequence of the devices used is not critical to the present invention.
[0112] Once the initial operation has been concluded, the first elongate device 10 can be removed from the duct 41. As depicted in FIG. 9d, the operator can conduct a device IDE by repositioning the distal ends of the ERCP catheter and wire guide 12,25 toward one another by advancing the catheter (as depicted), or preform a wire guide IDE by unlocking the wire guide 11 from the wire guide holder and drawing it back until the distal end 25 disengages from the catheter. Alternatively, the clinician can disengage or uncouple the device and wire guide 10,11 by moving both devices simultaneously until the wire guide exits the coupling region, typically keeping them within the work site 41 while uncoupling takes place. As discussed earlier, imageable indicia 18,26 on the distal portion 13 of the catheter 10 and the distal end 25 of the wire guide 11, respectively, are utilized to confirm under fluoroscopy that disengagement or uncoupling has occurred, as shown in FIG. 9e. The proximal indicia 21, depicted in FIGS. 4 and 8, and/or intermediate indicia 83 (FIGS. 26a-b) may also be utilized to provide confirmation that uncoupling has taken place within the work site. This optional step is shown in FIG. 12 in which the wire guide 11 is in the locked position 161 within the illustrative wire guide holder 50, which is attached about the opening 52 of the biopsy port of the scope (over the rim of the port and/or inserted therein), is subsequently disengaged and placed in the unlocked position 162 adjacent the primary access device 10 so that the proximal indicia 21 of the two devices 10,11 can be aligned. As long as the proximal mark 37 of the wire guide 11 remains distal of the alignment mark 81 of the primary access device 10, the operator knows that distal tip of the wire guide is still protruding from the distal end of the catheter within the duct (not shown). When the wire guide 11 is withdrawn (or primary device 10 advanced) such that the two marks 37,81 are in alignment, the operator knows the distal ends 12,25 of the two devices 10,11 are generally aligned within the duct. As the operator continues to draw back the wire guide 11 or advance the catheter 10, the alignment mark 37 becomes aligned with the disengagement mark 82, which in the illustrative embodiment is indicative that the distal end of the wire guide has pulled completely out of the passageway or coupling area such that the two devices are uncoupled within the duct.
