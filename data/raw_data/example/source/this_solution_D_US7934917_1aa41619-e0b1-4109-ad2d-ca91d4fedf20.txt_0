Electro-Blowing of Polyvinyl Alcohol
Several conditions for electro-blowing of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) using the high throughput electro-blowing apparatus were also tested. PVA solution (in water) is very hydrophilic and shows some degree of elasticity (almost like a thick glue). The rheological properties of PVA solution were 10 wt %, Mw=125 k, 88% hydrolyzed. FIGS. 18a and 18b show SEM images of electro-blowing of PVA (10%, Mw=125 k) at two different scales. It is seen that the fibers size was uniformly distributed and the estimated average diameter of the fibers was about 380 nm. The other processing conditions included a solution flow rate of 1.5 ml/min/50-spinnerets and a high voltage of 28 kV. The average air pressure was 50 psi.
A lower molecular weight PVA solution (10 wt % in water, Mw=78 k, 88% hydrolyzed) was also tested. The viscosity of this solution was significantly lower. FIGS. 19a and 19b show SEM images at different scales. The other operating conditions were similar to the previous PVA solution. By comparison of FIGS. 18a and 18b and FIGS. 19a and 19b, it can be observed that due to the lower viscosity (and therefore the elasticity), there is no re-melt taking places in electro-blowing of lower molecular weight PVA solution.
Electro-Blowing of Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone
The polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) has unique properties of a relatively low viscosity but strong hydrophilicity. The PVP solution (in water) had a concentration of 20 wt % with Mw of 1 M. Even though the viscosity of the prepared PVP solution was about the same as the PVA (10 wt %, Mw=125 k), the PVP solution was not as sticky as the PVA solution. FIG. 20 shows SEM image of electro-blown PVP membrane under the same experimental conditions as those of the PVA solution. The processing conditions included a solution flow rate of 1.5 ml/min/50-spinnerets, and a high voltage of 28 kV. The average air pressure was 50 psi. As shown in FIGS. 20a and 20b, the fiber size distribution was larger even though there was no re-melt occurring. The average diameter of the electro-blown fiber was about 420-480 nm.
