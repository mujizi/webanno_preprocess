[0096] In the above-described apparatus 1, the stuffing tubes 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 are respectively arranged to stop in a state of being arranged at the casing loading position I, the leading end closing position II, and the filling position III. However, the apparatus 1 may also be formed as an apparatus 200 which does not perform the leading end closing operation at the leading end closing position II, as will be described below.
[0097] Referring to FIGS. 8 to 11 and, as required, also to the embodiment drawings, already referred to above, of the apparatus 1, a description will be given of the apparatus 200. In the apparatus 200, the stuffing tubes 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 are provided on the stuffing tube moving body 10 at 120-degree intervals on a circumference PC about the rotational axis Xo. The stuffing tube 2-3 is located and remains at a standstill on the longitudinal axis X, i.e., at the filling position III, while the stuffing tubes 2-1 and 2-2 are respectively located and remain at a standstill at two casing loading positions I, i.e., a first casing loading position I-1 and a second casing loading position I-2. The stuffed casing conveying means 50 for conveying in a state of being suspended in loop form the stuffed casing SC formed by the stuffing tube 2-3 is disposed downstream of the filling position III.
[0098] Reference character OR denotes an operator who loads the casings C, i.e., the natural intestine casings C in this case, onto the stuffing tube 2-1 at a first casing loading position I-1 and the stuffing tube 2-2 at a second casing loading position I-2, respectively. This operator OR is also in charge of at least the end processing of the stuffed casings SC (the leading end closing processing and/or the trailing end closing processing) among the required processing operations with respect to the stuffed casings SC, which will be described later. Reference character WR denotes a processing staff member which is assigned to carry out required processing which could not be carried out by the operator OR among the required processing operations with respect to the stuffed casings SC. Accordingly, this processing staff member WR is not an essential staff member.
[0099] The metering pump 8 serving as a material supplying means has a servo motor 8M which turns on and off the operation of the pump 8. The motor 8M is arranged to effect starting and stopping on the basis of a stop signal 44 from a material-supply-stop commanding means 43 which will be described later. The metering pump 8 supplies the material M, which has been pressure fed from an unillustrated publicly known material pump, to the stuffing tube 2-3 in a filling step, and stops its supply in a non-filling step. The material M is discharged from the stuffing tube 2-3 into the casing C. The material supplying means may be constituted by the aforementioned publicly known material pump by excluding the metering pump 8 of this embodiment.
[0100] The link forming means 9 is mounted on a braking member moving body 41 which is attached to the main body housing 1a by means of a hinge mechanism 41-1. The link forming means 9 has a pair of chains 9B having pincher members 9A for forming twisted portions SCa by constricting the outer periphery of the stuffed casing SC. The twisted portion SCa is formed by the rotation of the stuffing tube 2-3, as will be described later, and the stuffed casing SC is connected by the twisted portions SCa and is thereby formed into a chain form.
