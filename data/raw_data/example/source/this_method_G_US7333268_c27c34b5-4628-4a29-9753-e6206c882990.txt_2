FIG. 15c shows yet another two-sided material 290 having a pigmented icon layer spacer 298 that blocks the lenses on one side of the material from seeing the `wrong` set of icons. Lenses 292 image 294 icon layer 296 but cannot image icon layer 300 because of the presence of pigmented icon layer 298. Similarly, lenses 302 image 304 icon layer 300, but cannot image icon layer 296 because of the presence of pigmented icon layer 298. Effects of each of the above described embodiments, OPM, Deep, Float, and Levitate, can be displayed from either side of a two-sided material according to this embodiment, and the projected images 294 and 304 can be of the same or different colors.
FIG. 15d discloses a further two-sided material 306 embodiment having lenses 308 that image 318 icon layer 314 and lenses 316 on the opposite side that image 322 icon layer 310. Icon layer 310 is close to, or substantially in contact with, the bases of lenses 308 and icon layer 314 is close to, or substantially in contact with, the bases of lenses 316. Icons 310 are too close to lenses 308 to form an image, so their light scatters 320 instead of focusing. Icons 314 are too close to lenses 316 to form an image, so their light scatters 324 instead of focusing. Effects of each of the above described embodiments, OPM, Deep, Float, and Levitate, can be displayed from either side of a two-sided material according to this embodiment, and the projected images 318 and 322 can be of the same or different colors.
FIGS. 16a-f are cross-sections and corresponding plan views illustrating three different methods for creating grayscale or tonal icon element patterns and subsequent synthetically magnified images with the present system. FIGS. 16a-c are cross-section details of the icon side of a material 307, including part of optical separator 309 and a transparent micro structured icon layer 311. The icon elements are formed as bas-relief surfaces 313, 315, 317 that are then filled with a pigmented or dyed material 323, 325, 327 respectively. The underside of the icon layer may be optionally sealed by a sealing layer 321 that can be transparent, tinted, colored, dyed, or pigmented, or opaque. The bas-relief micro structures of icon elements 313, 315, and 317 provide thickness variations in the dyed or pigmented fill material, 323, 325, and 327 respectively, that create variations in the optical density of the icon element as seen in plan view. The plan views corresponding to icon elements 323, 325, and 327 are plan views 337, 339, and 341. The use of this method to create grayscale or tonal synthetically magnified images is not limited to the specifics of the examples disclosed here, but may be generally applied to create an unlimited variety of grayscale images.
FIG. 16a includes icon element 313, dyed or pigmented icon element fill 323, and corresponding plan view 337. The cross section view of the icon plane at the top of this figure can only show one cutting plane through the icon elements. The location of the cutting plane is indicated by the dashed line 319 through the plane views 337, 339, and 341. Accordingly, the cross-section of icon element 313 is one plane through a substantially hemispherical-shaped icon element. By suitably limiting the overall dye or pigment density of the fill 323, thickness variations of the dyed or pigmented fill 323 create a tonal, or grayscale, optical density variations represented in the plan view 337. An array of icon elements of this type can be synthetically magnified within the present material system to produce images that show equivalent grayscale variations.
FIG. 16b includes icon element 315, dyed or pigmented icon element fill 325, and corresponding plan view 339. Plan view 339 shows that the icon element 315 is a bas-relief representation of a face. The tonal variations in an image of a face are complex, as shown by the complex thickness variations 325 in the cross-section view. As disclosed with regard to icon element 313, an array of icon elements of this type, as shown by 315, 325, and 339, can be synthetically magnified within the present material system to produce images that show equivalent grayscale variations representing, in this example, the image of a face.
