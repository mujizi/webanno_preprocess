[0028] The predicted protective performance of a fabric in heat and flame was measured using the "Thermal Protective Performance Test" (NFPA 2112). A flame was directed at a section of fabric mounted in a horizontal position at a specified heat flux (typically 84 kW/m.sup.2). The test measures the transmitted heat energy from the source through the specimen using a copper slug calorimeter with no space between the fabric and heat source. The test endpoint was characterized by the time required to attain a predicted second-degree skin burn injury using a simplified model developed by Stoll & Chianta, "Transactions New York Academy Science", 1971, 33 p 649. The value assigned to a specimen in this test, denoted as the "TPP value," is the total heat energy required to attain the endpoint, or the direct heat source exposure time to the predicted burn injury multiplied by the incident heat flux. Higher TPP values denote better insulation performance.
[0029] Vertical Flame Test
[0030] The "Vertical Flame Test" (ASTM D6413) is generally used as a screening test to determine whether a fabric burns, as a predictor for whether an article of clothing has any flame retarding properties. According to the test, a 3.times.12 inch section of fabric was mounted vertically and a specified flame was applied to its lower edge for twelve seconds. The response of the fabric to the flame exposure was recorded. The length of the fabric that was burned or charred was measured. Times for afterflame (i.e., the continued burning of the fabric section after removing the test flame) and afterglow (characterized by smoldering of the fabric section after removing the test flame) were also measured. Additionally, observations regarding melting and dripping from the fabric section were recorded. Pass/fail specifications based on this method are known for industrial worker clothing, firefighter turnout gear and flame retardant station wear, and military clothing. According to industry standards, a fabric can be considered flame retardant, or fire resistant, if it has a char length of less than six inches after a twelve second exposure to a flame.
[0031] Abrasion Resistance Test
[0032] Abrasion resistance was determined using ASTM method D3884, with a H-18 wheel, 500 gms load on a Taber abrasion resistance meter available from Teledyne Taber, 455 Bryant St., North Tonawanda, N.Y. 14120. Taber abrasion resistance was reported as cycles to failure.
