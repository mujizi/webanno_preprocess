[0067] for any frame whose priority level is higher than the reference value, compares every presentation time with the current time, and skips transmitting any frame whose presentation time is older than the current time.
[0068] As described above, in the tenth aspect, any frame with lower priority and any frame which cannot be in time for its presentation time although its priority is high is selectively skipped. In this manner, compared with a case where frame skip is performed at random, the quality deterioration due to the decrease of the transmission speed can successfully suppressed.
[0069] Here, such method in the tenth aspect as considering the priority level together with the presentation time at the time of frame selection is typically applied to video frames by MPEG. In this case, when the transmission speed is decreased, the frames of P and B are skipped as considered low in priority level. However, the frames of I are considered high in priority level and not skipped except for a case where those cannot be in time for their presentation time. Therefore, the quality deterioration due to the decrease of the transmission speed is minimized in any played back image. Here, if this method is applied to audio frames by MPEG, those are similar in priority level, and thus considered in such case is only the presentation time.
[0070] An eleventh aspect is directed to a system including a server for transmitting stream data over a network, and a terminal for playing back the stream data while receiving the same,
[0071] the terminal comprises:
