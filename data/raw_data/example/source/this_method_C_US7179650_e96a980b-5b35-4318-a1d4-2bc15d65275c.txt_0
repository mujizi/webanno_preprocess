In an important embodiment, the invention also provides a method for detecting a nucleic acid sequence encoding a sentrin polypeptide. The method generally involves obtaining sample nucleic acids suspected of encoding a sentrin polypeptide; contacting the sample nucleic acids with an isolated nucleic acid segment encoding the sentrin polypeptide under conditions effective to allow hybridization of substantially complementary nucleic acids; and detecting the hybridized complementary nucleic acids thus formed. The sample nucleic acids may be located within a cell, or may be separated from a cell prior to contact. Typically, the sentrin polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid segment may also comprise a detectable label, whereby the hybridized complementary nucleic acids may be detected by detecting the label. A nucleic acid detection kit represents a further aspect of the invention. Such a kit may contain in suitable container means, one or more isolated sentrin nucleic acid segments, one or more detection reagents, and optionally one or more restriction or polymerizing enzymes.
A further aspect of the invention involves a method of detecting a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme polypeptide. The method generally involves contacting the polypeptide with an amount of a sentrin-1 polypeptide composition effective to bind the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme polypeptide, and detecting the complexes so bound.
Also provided is a method of detecting a PML polypeptide. This method generally involves contacting the polypeptide suspected of being a PML polypeptide with an amount of a sentrin-1 polypeptide composition effective to bind the polypeptide, and detecting the complexes so bound. The method may typically involve obtaining a sample suspected of containing a sentrin polypeptide; contacting the sample with a first antibody that specifically binds to a sentrin polypeptide under conditions effective to form an immune complex; and detecting the immune complex so formed.
Another aspect of the invention is a method of inhibiting or preventing TNFR- or Fas/Apo-1 induced apoptosis in a cell. This method typically involves administering to a mammal, such as a human, a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of a sentrin polypeptide composition effective to inhibit or prevent the apoptosis.
A method of inhibiting or modulating sentrin polypeptide function in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal a composition comprising an antibody that specifically binds a sentrin polypeptide.
