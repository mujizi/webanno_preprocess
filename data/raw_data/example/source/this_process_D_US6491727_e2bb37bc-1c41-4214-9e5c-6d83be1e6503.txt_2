This process is very useful for specialty applications that can command a very high price, such as protective clothing for fire fighters and other workers who may be exposed to fire or excessive heat. It is generally not practical for cotton carpets or raised surface apparel that will be sold to the average consumer. The problems associated with this process include the high cost, the special equipment needed (ammoniation chamber) which is not generally available, and the two drying steps which are required.
Reactive phosphorus-based flame retardants are compounds (e.g., N-methylol dimethyl phosphonopropionamide (MDPPA)) that react with cellulose, the main constituent of cotton fiber. These compounds can be used both for cotton and for cotton blends with a low synthetic fiber content. The finish, usually applied to the fabric after the coloring stage, promotes char formation. The durability of the finish makes the resulting treated fabric suitable for curtains, upholstery, bed linen and protective clothing.
The reactive phosphorus-based flame retardants are typically applied using a pad/dry/cure method, in the presence of phosphoric acid catalyst. The finish is sometimes applied with a methylated melamine resin to increase the bonding/fixation of the agent to cellulose, which enhances the flame retardancy. Afterwashing is generally required, often with an alkali such as soda ash, followed by further rinsing and drying. The afterwashing helps to reduce loss of fabric strength. The reactive phosphorus-based process has the advantage of not requiring specialized equipment such as an ammonia cure unit, and has less affect on dyes than the pre-condensate process. However, this process can cause more strength loss than the pre-condensate process. Further, there can be a durability problem associated with some wash treatments if the instructions of the chemical supplier are not followed.
Reactive phosphorus-based flame retardants can be unsuitable for certain end uses, such as cotton or cotton blend carpets. This is especially true when the products contain formaldehyde, because of concerns about the human health effects of exposure to certain volatile organic compounds (VOC's) which may have been released from carpeting or carpet backing in past years. Because of this, most carpet manufacturers generally consider even very low levels of formaldehyde to be unacceptable. Another issue is that these products are generally designed to be afterwashed as part of the application procedure. While the toxicity of such materials is generally low, there are significant concerns about the exposure of babies or small children to residual unfixed chemicals left on the carpet.
A non-phosphorus approach for rendering cotton fire retardant has been to incorporate a water-insoluble, solid particulate mixture of brominated organic compounds and metal oxides, optionally with a metal hydrate, into the carpet fiber (U.S. Pat. No. 4,600,606 to Mischutin). However, a limitation of the chemistry is that the metal oxide compounds may be rendered soluble when washed if the pH of the solution is on the acid side. Also, particles of brominated organic compounds may be irritating to people coming into contact with them, and may be harmful if ingested.
