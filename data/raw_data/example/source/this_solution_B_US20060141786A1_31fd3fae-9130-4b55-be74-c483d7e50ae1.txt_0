[0056] Two significant advantages of the arrangement described above are the relatively low mask count and simplified wafer scale packaging. Both result in a significantly lower cost than existing solutions. This is realised by making the accelerometer sensor in the handle wafer (comparable to bulk MEMS). This is done by etching very deep trenches from the back of the wafer, until the buried oxide is reached. The buried oxide is etched to release the proof mass. It is the existing buried oxide that is used as the sacrificial layer. The existing handle wafer contacts provide the electrical connection.
[0057] As the wafer is relatively thick (100-200 .mu.m), large capacitance variations can be achieved with only a single plate (as compared to the much thinner polysilicon layer used in surface MEMS). Also, the proof mass is larger, which increases sensitivity.
[0058] The moving part is not exposed from the top side. Most metal and dielectric layers of the back-end process can be applied on top of the MEMS structure to improve stiffness. In order to seal the bottom of the structure, either a wafer with predefined cavities can be bonded, or the cavities can be etched prior to trench etching. In the latter case, a flat wafer can be used for sealing. The advantage of this solution is that nothing special needs to be done to provide electrical contact for bonding wires.
[0059] It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiment illustrates rather than limits the invention, and that those skilled in the art will be capable of designing many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. In the claims, any reference signs placed in parentheses shall not be construed as limiting the claims. The word "comprising" and "comprises", and the like, does not exclude the presence of elements or steps other than those listed in any claim or the specification as a whole. The singular reference of an element does not exclude the plural reference of such elements and vice-versa The invention may be implemented by means of hardware comprising several distinct elements, and by means of a suitably programmed computer. In a device claim enumerating several means, a number of these means may be embodied by one and the same item of hardware. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage.
