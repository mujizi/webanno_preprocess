[0752] In one especially preferred embodiment, and referring again to FIG. 5, in step 261 the cells of biological organisms are synchronized by means of cell cycle arresting drugs. These drugs are well known to those skilled in the art. Reference may be had, e.g., to European patent publication EP 0 870 506 for "Compositons comprising a cryptophicin compound in combination with a synchronizing or activating agent for treating cancer." As is disclosed in this patent publication, As used herein, the term "synchronizing agent" refers to an agent that can partially synchronize tumor cells with respect to cell cycle progression. Thus the term shall refer to cell cycle phase specific agents such as Gemcitabine, which is now commercially available and other agents such as multitargeted antifolate (MTA, LY231514), the sulfonylurea LY295501, cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, topoisomerase inhibitor, CPT-11, etoposide, VP-16, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, methotrexate, hydroxyurea and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT). Methods for preparing Gemcitabine are known to the skilled artisan and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,808,614, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. See also, European Patent number EP122707 (Sep. 16, 1987). . . As used herein the term "activating agent" refers to an agent that can activate non-cycling cells so that they enter the cell cycle where they will be sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of Compounds I-V and agents which effect growth factor downstream kinase cascade to activate the cell cycle. Examples of activating agents are growth factors, interleukins, and agents which modulate the function of cell cycle regulation which control cell cycle checkpoints and progression through the cell cycle. For example, but not limited to cdc25 phosphatase or p21. (sdil, wafl,cipl). Such growth factors and interleukins are known and readily available to the skilled artisan."
[0753] In one preferred embodiment, the synchronizing agent used is preferably an agent that can partially synchronize tumor cells with respect to cell cycle progression and preferably is a cell cycle phase specific agents such as Gemcitabine, which is now commercially available. Gemcitabine, and its synthesis, are well known to those skilled in the art. Reference may be had, e.g., to U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,994, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specificqtion. Claim 1 of this patent describes "An improved process to make gemcitabine hydrochloride, the improvement consisting essentially of making the lactone intermediate, 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-D-erythro-pentafura- nose-1-ulose-3,5-dibenzoate: [Figure] from D-erythro-2-Deoxy-2,2-difluoro-- 4,5-O-(1-ethylpropyl)-idene) pentoic acid tert-Butyl ester wherein, the D-erythro-2-Deoxy-2,2-difluoro-4,5-O-(1-ethylpropyl)-idene) pentoic acid tert-Butyl ester is prepared by the process of reacting S-tert-butyl difluoroethane thioate with 2,3-O (1-ethylpropylidene)-D-glyceraldehyde, in a solvent and in the presence of a strong base; with the proviso that the process is conducted in the absence of a catalyst and in the absence of a silyl containing"
[0754] As is known to those skilled in the human, biological organisms have built in "check points" which allow them to effectuate synchronization of cell growth upon the occurrence of various events. Thus, and referring to Chapter 17 of Bruce Alberts et al.'s "Molecular Biology of the Cell," Fourth Edition (Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y.), it is disclosed that "We can illustrate the importance of an adjustable cell-cycle control system by extending our washing machine analogy. The control system of simple embryonic cell cycles, like the controller in a simple washing machine, is based on a clock. The clock is unaffected by the events it regulates and will progress through the whole sequence of events even if one of those events has not been successfully completed. In contrast, the control system of most cell cycles (and sophisticated washing machines) is responsive to information received back from the processes it is controlling. Sensors, for example, detect the completion of DNA synthesis (or the successful filling of the washtub), and, if some malfunction prevents the successful completion of this process, signals are sent to the control system to delay progression to the next phase. These delays provide time for the machinery to be repaired and also prevent the disaster that might result if the cycle progressed prematurely to the next stage."
[0755] The Alberts et al. work also discloses that "In most cells there are several points in the cell cycle, called checkpoints, at which the cycle can be arrested if previous events have not been completed (FIG. 17-14). Entry into mitosis is prevented, for example, when DNA replication is not complete, and chromosome separation in mitosis is delayed if some chromosomes are not properly attached to the mitotic spindle . . . Progression through G1 and G2 is delayed by braking mechanisms if the DNA in the chromosomes is damaged by radiation or chemicals. Delays at these DNA damage checkpoints provide time for the damaged DNA to be repaired, after which the cell-cycle brakes are released and progress resumes." The Alberts et al. work also discloses that "Checkpoints are important in another way as well. They are points in the cell cycle at which the control system can be regulated by extracellular signals from other cells. These signals which can either promote or inhibit cell proliferation tend to act by regulating progression through a GI checkpoint, using mechanisms."
[0756] As will be apparent from many of the aforementioned United States patents, one may utilize externally applied chemotherapeutic agents to synchronize the cells within a biological organism at a certain stage. Thus, e.g., reference may again be had to U.S. Pat. No. 6,511,818, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification.
