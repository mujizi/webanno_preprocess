[0169] Another method for incorporating metal into a CVD diamond film chemical vapor infiltration. This process would first create a porous layer of material, and then fill the pores by chemical vapor infiltration. The porous layer thickness should be approximately equal to the desired thickness for either the uniform or gradient layer. The size and distribution of the pores can be sued to control ultimate composition of the layer. Deposition in vapor infiltration occurs first at the interface between the porous layer and the substrate. As deposition continues, the interface along which the material is deposited moves outward from the substrate to fill pores in the porous layer. As the growth interface moves outward, the deposition temperature along the interface is maintained by moving the sample relative to a heater or by moving the heater relative to the growth interface. It is imperative that the porous region between the outside of the sample and the growth interface be maintained at a temperature that does not promote deposition of material (either the pore-filling material or undesired reaction products). Deposition in this region would close the pores prematurely and prevent infiltration and deposition of the desired material in inner pores. The result would be a substrate with open porosity an poor physical properties.
[0170] Another alternative manufacturing process that may be used to produce bearing surfaces and components of the invention involves use of energy beams, such as laser energy, to vaporize constituents in a substrate and redeposit those constituents on the substrate in a new form, such as in the form of a diamond coating. As an example, a metal, polymeric or other substrate may be obtained or produced containing carbon, carbides or other desired constituent elements. Appropriate energy, such as laser energy, may be directed at the substrate to cause constituent elements to move from within the substrate to the surface of the substrate adjacent the area of application of energy to the substrate. Continued application of energy to the concentrated constituent elements on the surface of the substrate can be used to cause vaporization of some of those constituent elements. The vaporized constituents may then be reacted with another element to change the properties and structure of the vaporized constituent elements.
[0171] Next, the vaporized and reacted constituent elements (which may be diamond) may be diffused into the surface of the substrate. A separate fabricated coating may be produced on the surface of the substrate having the same or a different chemical composition than that of the vaporized and reacted constituent elements. Alternatively, some of the changed constituent elements which were diffused into the substrate may be vaporized and reacted again and deposited as a coating on the. By this process and variations of it, appropriate coatings such as diamond, cubic boron nitride, diamond like carbon, B.sub.4C, SiC, TiC, TiN, TiB, cCN, Cr.sub.3C.sub.2, and Si.sub.3N.sub.4 may be formed on a substrate.
[0172] In other manufacturing environments, high temperature laser application, electroplating, sputtering, energetic laser excited plasma deposition or other methods may be used to place a volume of diamond, diamond-like material, a hard material or a superhard material in a location in which will serve as a bearing surface.
[0173] In light of the disclosure herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will comprehend the apparatuses, materials and process conditions necessary for the formation and use of high quality diamond on a substrate using any of the manufacturing methods described herein in order to create a diamond bearing surface.
