[0072] The ratio E/R is given by Equation 33. By substituting the values of m.sub.1 and m.sub.2 from Equation 25, Equation 33 can be rewritten as follows: E R = ln .function. [ ( 1 - x x ) 2 .times. ( y 1 - y ) 2 .times. ( F 1 .times. Gm F 1 .times. Si ) .times. ( F 2 .times. Si F 2 .times. Gm ) .times. ( d 1 d 2 ) ] 1 T 1 - 1 T 2 ( 42 ) If the terms F.sub.1Gm and F.sub.2Gm are rewritten in terms of the germane gas flow rates (F.sub.1Ge/d.sub.1 and F.sub.2Ge/d2 respectively), then Equation 42 can be rewritten as E R = ln .function. [ ( 1 - x x ) 2 .times. ( y 1 - y ) 2 .times. ( F 1 .times. Ge F 1 .times. Si ) .times. ( F 2 .times. Si F 2 .times. Ge ) ] 1 T 1 - 1 T 2 ( 43 )
[0073] Prior to conducting the third reaction, the process engineer can select values for three of the four parameters F.sub.3Si, F.sub.3Gm, T.sub.3, and z (it is assumed that the dilution rating d.sub.3 is also known). Then, Equations 38 (or 39) and 42 can be used to calculate the value of the unselected parameter. Alternatively, Equations 40, 41, and 43 can be used if the germane flow rates (as opposed to the flow rates of the germane/carrier mixture) are known and/or desired to be calculated. Several examples are presented below for a better understanding of the methods for calculating these parameters.
[0074] This method has been conducted in a temperature limited regime where the crystal growth is affected mostly by surface effects. This shows that it is independent of the actual silicon and germanium precursors. Some embodiments of the invention are not limited to hydride precursors, such as Si.sub.nH.sub.2n+2 and Ge.sub.mH.sub.2m+2. For example, this method can be used with chlorinated precursors.
[0075] Note that it is possible to deposit the first layer Si.sub.1-xGe.sub.x and second layer Si.sub.1-yGe.sub.y on the same wafer, and then remove the wafer for analysis of the deposited layers in order to set process conditions for depositing the third layer Si.sub.1-zGe.sub.z on any wafer, including the same wafer if desired.
