a second step for separating the third master from the second light transmitting layer; and
a third step for filling the light blocking recess with a light blocking material.
In this method a light blocking recess is formed in the second light transmitting layer using the light blocking protrusion of the third master as a die. A light blocking layer is then formed by filling the light blocking recess with a light blocking material. The resulting light blocking layer forms a black matrix.
Because the light blocking material is simply filled to the light blocking recess and it is not necessary to remove the light blocking material from the master, it is not deformed and voids do not occur therein.
Furthermore, once manufactured, the third master can also be used repeatedly insofar as durability allows. The steps required to produce the master can therefore be eliminated from the production process for the second and subsequent optical substrates, thereby further reducing the number of production steps and helping to further reduce cost.
