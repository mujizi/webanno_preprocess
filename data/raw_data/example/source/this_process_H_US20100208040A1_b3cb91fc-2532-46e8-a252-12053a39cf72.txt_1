[0020] In accord with embodiments generally consistent with implementations of the present invention, the problem can be resolved by assuring that, as depicted in FIG. 3, at all times the input images are transformed into images wherein the UI 120 is situated at a position within the apparent three dimensional depth of the displayed image which is closer to the viewer (has a greater value of +ve) than any portion of the three dimensional image. This can be accomplished in a number of ways. As depicted in FIG. 3, the plane of the UI 120 is juxtaposed at a position which is closer than the images in the three dimensional image, without altering the three dimensional image. However, this may not always be possible or comfortable for the viewer.
[0021] As depicted in FIG. 4, one solution to this problem is to place the plane of the two dimensional UI at a depth position that is comfortable for general viewing by the viewer, while moving the relative positions of the three dimensional objects further backward (more negative -ve) in the direction of the arrow. As a part of this process, the span from closest object to farthest object from the viewer may be retained or compressed/scaled as desired so as to transform the images into images that can be positioned as described. In one implementation, the scaling can be carried out by leaving the rearmost position intact and proportionally moving the image elements in front of the rearmost portion backward. In this case, the foremost position is placed far enough back to permit insertion of the secondary image (UI) in front, and the relative position of intermediate objects is scaled proportionally. However, other scaling and compressing methods will occur to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the present teachings.
[0022] This process can also be extended to usage on a two dimensional image displayed on a stereoscopic display along with a two dimensional UI as depicted in FIG. 5. In this case, as in the case of three dimensional content, the relative position of the two dimensional UI 120 can be placed at a position in the three dimensional illusion which is closer to the user than a two dimensional image 130. While this depiction shows the two dimensional image 130 being in -ve depth and the UI being in the +ve depth, this is only to be considered illustrative. This only consideration is that the UI be placed closer to the viewer in the illusion than the video image.
[0023] As a further example, it is possible for the UI to be represented as a three dimensional object as shown in FIG. 6 as UI 140 which has varying depth and which is positioned in front of the two dimensional image 130 displayed on the stereoscopic display panel 100. It will be evident that one can also place a three dimensional UI such as 140 in front of a three dimensional image such as the image containing 104, 108 and 112.
[0024] To realize this solution, there should be knowledge of the depth of objects in the content. There are at least two methods to acquire this depth information, but any suitable method is satisfactory for purposes of implementation of embodiments consistent with the present invention.
