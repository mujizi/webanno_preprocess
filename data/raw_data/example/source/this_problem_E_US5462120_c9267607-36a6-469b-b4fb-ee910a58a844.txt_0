These considerations on artificial lift are equally applicable to new wells and to the re-entry into an existing casing, to vertical as well as to deviated cased wells.
CASE 6 (FLOW THROUGH A SYPHON)
In under-pressured reservoirs containing low GOR oil, reservoir energy may be insufficient to convey the production stream up to a pump or gas lift valve located above the kick-off points of the drainholes. The difference in elevation between such a pump and the fluids entry points in the horizontal part of the drainholes is greater than the drainholes radius of curvature, which may be up to 500 ft. In addition, there are significant friction pressure drops through the horizontal and curved portions of small-diameter liners, which may reduce the calculated net flowing fluid head at the pump (49) inlet to a value below the required minimum NPSH of the pump. This indicates that cavitation is likely to occur in the pump, with highly detrimental erosion effects and a reduced flowrate. To alleviate this problem, flow from each drainhole may be directed to an oil sump (50), with the pump taking suction at or near the bottom of the sump. The top of the sump is closed by a packer (51) a short distance above the highest kick-off point. It constitutes the apex of a kind of syphon (see FIG. 6) for each drainhole. For very low GOR oil, frequently present in under-pressured mature reservoirs, the flowing pressure at that point may still be well above the bubble point of the production stream, so that the risk of cavitation and break-up of the de-celerating liquid stream at that point is much less than it would be in a pump at the same location. The flowing pressure at the apex, plus the liquid head in the sump, provide a pump suction pressure exceeding the minimum NPSH required, thus eliminating the risk of cavitation in the bottom pump.
Instead of a pump, an intermittent flow gas lift system may also be used for the same purpose. In this known system, a gas piston lifts an oil slug up the tubing after the standing valve at the bottom has closed. This is equivalent to a beam pump, but more tolerant of sand production.
The drilling and tie-in equipment and procedures are the same as in Cases 1, 2, and 4, except that a sump is drilled and cased vertically below the lowest kick-off point. In Cases 1 and 4, that sump may be created by placing the special casing joint well above the casing shoe.
