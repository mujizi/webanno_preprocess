[0015] FIG. 6C is a perspective view of the carrying case of FIG. 6A and a containing box therefor.
[0016] FIG. 7 is a plan view of a die-cut medium for forming a carrying case.
[0017] Where cut plants, such as flowers, are required to be packaged with water for transportation, various means for enclosing the cut end of the plant stem in water have been provided to minimize the risk of water spillage. For example, it is generally known to insert the stem end into a small vial containing water and sealed with a rubber or plastic cap. The cap is provided with a hole or slit for receiving the stem, and thereby provides a substantially watertight seal to prevent significant leakage of water from the vial. However, this solution often requires a separate vial for each stem end to be kept in water; the more stems inserted through each cap, the less snug the fit between the cap and the stems may be. Another solution requires the cut end of each stem, or groups of stems, to be encased in a small foam piece impregnated with water. The foam may be shaped like an envelope or pouch, or may alternatively be provided as a flat piece to be folded around the stem ends. The foam piece may then be secured by elastic bands or some other binding. Again, this solution often requires multiple pieces if the floral or plant arrangement to be packaged contains multiple stems. In any event, once the cut plants are unpacked for display, for example by the ultimate recipient, the recipient must remove each of the vials or foam pieces and arrange the plants in a vessel such as a vase.
[0018] Other solutions may include the use of compressible foam or a similarly compressible material to seal the opening of a vessel containing water, and inserting the cut stem ends of the plants though the foam or other material and into the water. These solutions require selection of appropriate foam or other material with an appropriate compressibility factor that is sufficiently water-impermeable, and holes or slits cut in the foam or other material to admit the stems, again such that the seal around each stem, and between the foam and the vessel opening, is substantially watertight. Further, if the recipient wishes to add more water to the vessel, either the entire piece of foam or other material must be removed, or one or more individual stems from the foam must be removed so that water can be added. This potentially destroys the watertight seal when the foam piece or stem is replaced, as the overall contours of the foam or other material may have been altered by handling. In addition, if the foam or other material is sized to receive specific stem sizes, it may not be reusable for other plants.
[0019] Therefore, in accordance with the embodiments described below, an apparatus, assembly and method are provided for packaging horticultural products for transport. In particular, the horticultural products may be cut plants such as flowers, comprising stems. For ease of reference, the description below may refer to cut flowers, but it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein may be used with other plants or horticultural products.
