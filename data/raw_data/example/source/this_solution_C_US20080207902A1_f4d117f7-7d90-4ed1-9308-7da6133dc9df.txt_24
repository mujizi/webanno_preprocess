Example 124
2-ethyl-7-methylthio-4-propionyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0407]The compound of Example 110 (400 mg) was dissolved in DME (10.0 mL). To this solution, sodium thiomethoxide (128 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred at 60.degree. C. for 1.5 hours. Subsequently, water was added and the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification of the residue by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=4:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (253 mg).
