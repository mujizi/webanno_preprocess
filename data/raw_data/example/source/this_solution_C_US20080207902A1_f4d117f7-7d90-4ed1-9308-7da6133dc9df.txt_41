Examples 233 and 234
6-(7-carbamoyl-2-ethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl--3-(2H)-pyridazinone and 6-(2-ethyl-7-methoxycarboimidoyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)-4,5-dihydr-o-5-methyl-3-(2H)-pyridazinone
[0686]The compound of Example 230 (22.1 mg) was dissolved in methanol (2.00 .mu.L). To this solution, 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (36.0 mL) and 25% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution (27.0 .mu.L) were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3.5 hours. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification of the residue by amino-silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=1:2) afforded a CONH.sub.2-form (9.5 mg) as a yellow solid powder and a C(.dbd.NH)OMe-form as an orange solid powder.
