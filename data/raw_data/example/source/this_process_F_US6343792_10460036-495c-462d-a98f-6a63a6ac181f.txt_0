Below, the method of forming the above slope at the top end of leaf 18 will be explained with reference to FIGS. 6A to 6C.
The slope 2018a is formed at the top end (i.e., the inner-peripheral side or the rotation shaft 11 side) of flat plate-shape leaf 18, and the first process is performed after the outer-peripheral base ends of leaves 18 are brazed to predetermined positions of casing 11 with a predetermined acute angle (see FIG. 6A). Here, the leaves 18 are attached at an acute angle .alpha. with respect to the peripheral surface 511a, and the top ends of the leaves 18 are processed using a discharge polishing method or a grinding method so as to form slope 2018a.
FIG. 6B simply shows the process using the grinding method, and reference numeral 21 in the figure indicates a grindstone. The rotating grindstone 21 proceeds in the direction 22 indicated by the outline arrow, that is, in the same direction as the rotation direction of the rotation shaft 11, substantially in parallel with the peripheral surface 511a of the rotation shaft 11, so that the top ends of leaves 18 are ground. In this process, the inner-peripheral ends of leaves 18, which are free ends, are pushed and held up by grindstone 21; thus, the grinding process is performed under another angle condition .alpha.' (shifted from angle .alpha.). Therefore, the processed slope 2018a is substantially parallel with the peripheral surface 511a while the leaves 18 are inclined by angle .alpha.'.
If the discharge polishing method is adopted for forming slope 2018a, the angle of inclination of the leaves 18 is shifted in advance from .alpha. to .alpha.' and the angle .alpha.' is maintained during the process by using a suitable tool or the like.
FIG. 6C shows the leaves after the process, that is, the angle of inclination is returned from .alpha.' to .alpha. by releasing the held-up state produced by using grindstone 21 (in the grinding method), or by using a tool (in the discharge polishing method). As a result, the slope 2018a processed with the inclination angle .alpha.' and substantially in parallel with the peripheral surface 511a of the rotation shaft 11 has a small angle .beta. with respect to the peripheral surface 511a, where .beta. corresponds to the difference between angles .alpha. and .alpha.'.
