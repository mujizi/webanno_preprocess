[0075] Hydrocarbon products derived from VFA mixtures alone include: ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, ethylene, and propylene. In addition, pure hydrogen gas (H.sub.2) is produced in large quantities, as well as carbon dioxide, which can be sequestered and reused in the deoxygenation/air displacement step. Hydrocarbon products derived from VFA-MCFA mixtures can include alkanes and alkenes with carbon numbers C5 to C20, including n-octane and kerosene (see Table 1).
I. Biological Stage (Fermentation):
[0076] Example Bio-1. Fermentation of eastern gamagrass to VFA. A flask containing 600 mL of Goering-Van Soest medium (Goering and Van Soest, 1970; contents per liter: 8.75 g NaHCO.sub.3, 1.0 g NH.sub.4HCO.sub.3, 1.55 g KH.sub.2PO.sub.4, 1.43 g Na.sub.2HPO.sub.4, 0.15 g MgSO.sub.4), 16.4 g of air-dried Eastern gamagrass (ground in a Wiley mill having a 1 mm screen), 1.0 g of Trypticase, and 0.002 g of resazurin, was gassed under a stream of CO.sub.2, after which 0.6 g of cysteine HCl and 0.05 g of Na.sub.2S.9H.sub.2O was added. The flask was inoculated with rumen contents (-80 mL of liquid and 20 g squeezed solids) prepared by mixing similar amounts from two rumen-fistulated cows. The flask was incubated at 39.degree. C. without shaking. After 54 h incubation, samples were removed for fermentation product analysis. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000.times.g for 10 min, and 600 uL of the supernatant liquid was combined with 600 uL of CHS (26.45 g Ca(OH).sub.2 added to 100 mL H.sub.2O) and 300 uL of CSR (10 g CuSO.sub.4+0.4 g crotonic acid per 100 mL aqueous solution). The mixture was frozen, thawed and centrifuged. The supernatant liquid was transferred to tubes containing 28 uL of H.sub.2SO.sub.4, and this solution, frozen and thawed twice, then centrifuged. The supernatant liquid was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using a 250 mm.times.4.6 mm Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H analytical column maintained at 45.degree. C. Samples (50 uL) were eluted with a mobile phase of 0.015; N H.sub.2SO.sub.4/0.0034 M ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min, and separated peaks were detected with a refractive index detector. Quantification was achieved by comparison to standard curves, with crotonic acid as internal standard. After incubation the culture contained 77.5 mM acetic, 21.7 mM propionic, 8.8 mM butyric, 1.4 mM isobutyric, 2.7 mM valeric, and 2.4 mM of a combination of 2-methylbutyric and 3-methylbutyric acids.
[0077] Example Bio-2. Production of VFA in stable enrichment cultures. The culture from Example Bio-1 was sequentially transferred for 7 successive transfers of -50 g of liquids and solids at 2 to 3 d. The culture medium was the same as described in Example Bio-1, except incubations were conducted at one-half volumetric scale (300 mL medium), and the Trypticase was replaced by dried distillers grains (DDG). After 28 h incubation at 39.degree. C. without shaking, fermentation broth samples were collected and analyzed as described in Example Bio-1. The amounts of fermentation products in the cultures were 113.9 mM acetic, 33.6 mM propionic, 10.3 mM butyric, 0.6 mM isobutyric, 2.0 mM valeric, and 1.0 mM of a combination of 2-methylbutyric and 3-methylbutyric (isovaleric) acids.
[0078] Example Bio-3. VFA production from biomass feedstocks by stabilized mixed cultures of ruminal microorganisms. Fermentations were conducted at 39.degree. C. in unshaken Erlenmeyer flasks in 150 mL of a Goering/Van Soest medium supplemented with 4 g dried biomass feedstock (Eastern gamagrass or alfalfa, ground through a 1 mm Wiley mill screen but otherwise not pretreated) and 0.5 g of DDG. Flasks were gassed with CO.sub.2 prior to inoculation but were incubated with vented closures, without additional gas sparging, during the fermentation. Cultures were transferred at intervals of 2 to 4 days by pouring -20% by volume of culture from the previous culture to a flask containing fresh medium. VFA concentrations were determined in culture supernatants obtained by centrifugation of 2- to 4-d old cultures at 12,000.times.g for 10 min. Results are shown in Table B-1.
