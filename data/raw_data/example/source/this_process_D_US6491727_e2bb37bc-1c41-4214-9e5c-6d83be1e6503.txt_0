There have been many techniques for imparting durable flame resistance properties to cellulosic substrates described in the literature. However, there are relatively few that are practiced today, due to commercial availability of the chemicals, safety concerns, process control issues or other reasons. Durable flame retardants are typically more complex, more expensive and more difficult to apply than non-durable treatments. The main flame retardant finishes used on cotton are phosphorus-based.
Two of the more common phosphorus-based systems which are used to provide durable flame resistance to cotton substrates are the "pre-condensate"/ammonia process and the reactive phosphorus process.
In the "pre-condensate"/NH.sub.3 process, the flame-retardant agent exists as a polymer in the fibrils of cotton fibers and is not combined chemically with OH groups in the cotton fiber. This process imparts durable flame resistance to 100% cotton fabrics when applied under proper application procedures. It produces fabrics with a good hand and strength retention. Proper application of pre-condensates to cotton fabrics requires adequate fabric preparation, proper padding/uniform application, proper phosphorus add-on relative to fabric properties, appropriate moisture control prior to ammoniation, control of the ammoniation step to ensure adequate polymer formation, and effective oxidation and washing of the treated fabric.
This process is very useful for specialty applications that can command a very high price, such as protective clothing for fire fighters and other workers who may be exposed to fire or excessive heat. It is generally not practical for cotton carpets or raised surface apparel that will be sold to the average consumer. The problems associated with this process include the high cost, the special equipment needed (ammoniation chamber) which is not generally available, and the two drying steps which are required.
Reactive phosphorus-based flame retardants are compounds (e.g., N-methylol dimethyl phosphonopropionamide (MDPPA)) that react with cellulose, the main constituent of cotton fiber. These compounds can be used both for cotton and for cotton blends with a low synthetic fiber content. The finish, usually applied to the fabric after the coloring stage, promotes char formation. The durability of the finish makes the resulting treated fabric suitable for curtains, upholstery, bed linen and protective clothing.
