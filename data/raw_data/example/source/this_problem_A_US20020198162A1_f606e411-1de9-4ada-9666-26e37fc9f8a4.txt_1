[0389] Background
[0390] When used as a vaccine, recombinant monomeric gp120 has failed to induce antibodies that have strong neutralizing activity with primary isolates of the HIV virus. It has been suggested that oligomeric forms of the HIV envelope protein which expose certain regions of the tertiary structure would be better able to elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies (Panin et al. (1997) Immunol. Lett. 57: 105-112; VanCott et al. (1997) J. Virol. 71: 4319-4330;
[0391] In this Example, DNA shuffling is applied to this problem, in order to obtain gp120 polypeptides which adopt conformations slightly different from those of previous preparations of recombinant gp120. To allow the individual gp120 molecules to interact as oligomers, a fusion is prepared between gp120 sequences (on the N-terminus of the fusion) and HBsAg sequences (on the C-terminal of the fusion).
[0392] The N-terminal peptide sequence of the S region of the HBsAg polypeptide is a transmembrane structure which is locked into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. The actual N-terminus of the S region as well as the preS2 sequences are located in the lumenal part of the ER. They are found on the outside of the final HBsAg particles. By placing the gp120 sequences on the N-terminus of the HBsAg preS2 or S sequences, the gp120 sequences are also located on the outside of the particles. The gp120 molecules can thus be brought together in three-dimensional space to interact as in the virus.
[0393] Since the exact conformation of the final chimera which will have the most appropriate immunogenicity cannot be predicted, DNA shuffling is employed. The sequences of the HBsAg polypeptide, which functions as a scaffold, and of gp120 are both shuffled. Screening of the shuffled products can be performed by ELISA assay using antibodies (polyclonal or monoclonal) which have previously been determined to have virus neutralizing activity.
