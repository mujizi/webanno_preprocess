Steps of the Solution
1. Agitation Method Breakthrough
It has been found that if a plastic grocery bag is tied shut with fruit and water inside, nearly devoid of but including some air, and alternately squeeze it first on one side with one hand and then on the other side with the other hand, causing the water to rush by the fruit, being held in close proximity to the fruit by the plastic bag, the fruit is quickly washed with little abrasion damage to the fruit. Much riper fruit can be washed without damage by this method than by the spraying water method.
This method of washing is adapted to laundering clothes in this invention with the result of superior cleaning and less damage to the clothes being laundered. By experimentation, it been found that if a plastic grocery bag is tied shut with articles of laundry and water inside, nearly devoid of but including some air, and alternately squeezed first on one side with one hand and then on the other side with the other hand, a violent washing action is set up with little energy required. Such washing action is much less damaging to the laundry items. Yet, the laundry items are cleaned as effectively as though they were cleaned by the more destructive method of rubbing.
Of course, eventually the plastic grocery bag breaks and the water spills out. The grocery bag is not practical for that reason. However, with the recent advances in technology, there are much stronger materials available. An example of such a material is polyurethane coated fabric woven from aramid fiber.
