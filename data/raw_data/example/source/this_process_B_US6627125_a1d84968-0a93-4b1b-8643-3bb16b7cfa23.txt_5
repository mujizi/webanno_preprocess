Any of the materials usable for the reinforcing layer 50 in the first embodiment can also be used for this reinforcing layer 140. The light transmitting layer precursor 132 is also set using a process appropriate to its composition.
Referring next to FIG. 6(A), the first master 110 is removed from the first light transmitting layer 120 and color pattern layer 100. This leaves the color pattern layer 100 transferred from the profile of the color recesses 112 in the first master 110 molded integrally to.the first light transmitting layer 120.
Next, the surface of the light transmitting layer 120 on which the color pattern layer 100 is formed and a second reinforcing layer 160 are bonded with a third light transmitting layer precursor 152 therebetween. This process is the same as that used to bond by way of intervening light transmitting layer precursor 32 of the first embodiment. The light transmitting layer precursor 152 can also be selected from the materials available for use as the above-noted light transmitting layer precursor 32.
By thus spreading the third light transmitting layer precursor 152 and applying an appropriate setting process to form a third light transmitting layer 150 as shown in FIG. 6(C), optical substrate 2 is achieved.
This optical substrate 2 comprises first to third light transmitting layers 120, 130, and 150 disposed between first and second first reinforcing layers 140 and 160. A color pattern layer 100 is formed integrally to one side of the first light transmitting layer 120. A plurality of lenses 124 is formed on the other side of the first light transmitting layer 120. Furthermore, the pixels of the color pattern layer 100 are formed at positions corresponding to the lenses 124.
