[0090]Like support system 10, support system 110 may be used when gas turbine engine 182 is not running to support one or more portions of gas turbine engine 182 while they are moved relative to base/support 116. For example, guide tracks 112, 114 and moveable supports 162, 164 may be used to support compressor 187 and combustor 186 while they are moved independently of power-turbine section 188. In preparation for doing so, as FIG. 8B shows, moveable support 162 may be mounted to guide tracks 112 and connected to compressor 187 in a manner allowing moveable support 162 to support compressor 187 from guide tracks 112. Additionally, moveable support 164 may be assembled using lower portion 224, and moveable support 164 may then be mounted to guide tracks 114 and attached to combustor 186 in a manner allowing moveable support 164 to suspend combustor 186 from guide tracks 114.
[0091]Once moveable supports 162, 164 are engaged to gas turbine engine 182 and guide tracks 112, 114 in this manner, various engagements attaching compressor 187 and combustor 186 to other components of power system 180 may be released. The engagements between compressor 187 and engine support 122, as well as the engagements between combustor 186 and power-turbine section 188 may be released. If it is desired to leave intake ducting 185 stationary while moving compressor 187 and combustor 186, support 274 may be put in place to support intake ducting 185, and the engagements between intake ducting 185 and compressor 187 may be released. The engagements between intake ducting 185 and compressor 187 may include annular rings (not shown) connected between an outer portion of compressor 187 and intake ducting 185. Thus, to release compressor 187 from intake ducting 185, these annular rings may be released from compressor 187 and/or intake ducting 185.
[0092]Once all engagements preventing movement of compressor 187 and combustor 186 away from power-turbine section 188 have been released and moveable supports 162, 164 are supporting compressor 187 and combustor 186 from guide tracks 112, 114, compressor 187, combustor 186, and moveable supports 162, 164 may be slid away from power-turbine section 188 in the direction of longitudinal axis 192 on guide tracks 112, 114. FIG. 9 shows compressor 187, combustor 186, and moveable supports 162, 164 after being slid away from power-turbine section 188. As can be seen by comparing FIG. 9 to FIG. 8B, with compressor 187 disconnected from intake ducting 185 during this process, compressor 187 may slide through the center of intake ducting 185.
[0093]Support system 110 may also be used to support gas producer 184 and combustor 186 while they are moved independently of power-turbine section 188 in a direction other than along longitudinal axis 192. For example, referring to FIGS. 10A-10D, guide tracks 205, 208, 210 may be used to support gas producer 184 and combustor 186 while they are moved in the direction of an axis 276 that extends at an angle to longitudinal axis 192 of gas turbine engine 182. The angle between axis 276 and longitudinal axis 192 may have various values. In some embodiments, axis 276 may extend substantially perpendicular to longitudinal axis 192 of gas turbine engine 182.
[0094]Before gas producer 184 and combustor 186 may be moved in the direction of axis 276 on guide tracks 205, 208, 210, some preparatory steps may be required. If support 246 and guide tracks 205, 208, 210 are not already in place, they may be set up as shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B. Support 246 may be set in place adjacent base/support 116 using various means. For example, in embodiments where support system 110 includes transport wheels for support 246, support 246 may be rolled into place using those transport wheels. Support 246 may be positioned such that support structures 252, 256, 260 are substantially aligned with support structures 124, 126, 128, respectively, in the directions of axes 118, 192. Once support 246 is so positioned, the weight of support 246 may be released onto legs 250, so that legs 250 may hold support 246 stationary adjacent base/support 116. In embodiments where transport wheels are used to roll support 246 into place adjacent base/support 116, releasing the weight of support 246 onto legs 250 may involve removing or raising those wheels.
