A compound 39 is prepared by reacting compound 37 with a carbamoyl halide or sulfamoyl halide. The reaction proceeds under an inert atmosphere in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine in a halogenated organic solvent such as dichloromethane or dichloroethane.
In the following step, an phenylamine compound of formula Il is prepared by removing the P.sup.2 -protecting group from compound 39 by treatment with a with a base such as lithium hydroxide. Suitable solvents for the reaction include alcoholic or protic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, or water.
An exemplary preparation of a compound of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compound of formula Il is described in detail in Example 20.
Scheme M
Scheme M, in general, describes the preparation of compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 are as defined in the Summary of the Invention from the corresponding intermediate compounds of formulae Ia-Il. ##STR21##
