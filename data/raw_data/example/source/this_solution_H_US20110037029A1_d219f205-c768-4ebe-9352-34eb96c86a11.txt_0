Compound 4 (Imidazole-Monomer)
[0096] To an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (50 mL, 0.3 M) was added DMF (50 mL) and histamine dihydrochloride (2.50 g, 13.59 mmol). To this solution was added compound 2 (2.75 g, 16.3 mmol) in a solution of DMF, with stiffing at 4.degree. C. The reaction was monitored via TLC by ninhydrin stain for primary amines, and confirmed to be complete after 30 min to give the crude compound 3. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the product re-dissolved in DMF (50 mL). The solution was filtered, and triethylamine was introduced (2.27 mL, 16.30 mmol). BOC.sub.2O was added dropwise at 4.degree. C., and the solution was stirred overnight at RT. Water was added and the solution extracted with CHCl.sub.3 (3.times.25 mL). The organics were combined and dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent removed in vacuo. The crude product was purified by silica column (ethyl acetate/hexanes gradient 50:50 to 100:0, v/v) to give the pure product as a clear oil (2.59 g, 72% yield). .sup.1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl.sub.3): .delta. (ppm) 1.54 (s, 9H), 2.72 (t, 2H), 3.53 (dt, 2H), 5.53 (dd, J.sub.1=1.8 Hz, J.sub.2=10.0 Hz, 1H,), 6.07 (dd, J1=9.8 Hz, J2=17.0 Hz, 1H), 6.19 (dd, J1=1.8 Hz, J2=17.0 Hz, 1H), 7.10 (s, 1H), 7.95 (s, 1H).
