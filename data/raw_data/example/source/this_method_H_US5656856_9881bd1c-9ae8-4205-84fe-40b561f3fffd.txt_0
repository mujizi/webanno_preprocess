2. Description of the Prior Art
Recently, there has been a trend towards making modules and surface mounting packages compact and thin in order to provide highly dense mounting of semiconductor packages. In compliance with this trend, compact and thin packages such as TSOP (Thin Small Outline Package) and UTSOP (Ultra Thin Small Outline Package) have been developed, and these packages are used mainly for main memory devices of computers.
The integration density of IC (Integrated Circuit) devices can be increased by forming finely the elements which constitute the IC and the metal wiring which connects these elements. However, this method is difficult to put into practical use, due to limitations present in fabrication.
To avoid these problems, methods for increasing mounting density by mounting a highly dense packaged module, or by stacking high density chips, in a three-dimensional arrangement has been proposed. A highly dense mounting of chips on a substrate such as a printed circuit board can be accomplished by mounting a plurality of surface-mounting chips or TAB (Tape Automated Bonding) packages on the substrate.
However, as very large scale integrated (LSI) circuits tend to get more complex, there is a need to switch more output driver circuits simultaneously, at a faster rate, in order to increase the performance thereof. This increase in the switching speed results in an increase in the amount of electrical noise which is associated therewith. Therefore, various attempts for reducing or minimizing the noise associated with the increase in the switching rate have been made.
