3-chloro-2-ethyl-4-methoxy-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0297]The compound of Example 49 (2.07 g) was dissolved in DMF (60 mL). To this solution, NCS (1.88 g) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5.5 hours. Subsequently, water was added and the mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure and purification by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=3:1) afforded the title compound as a gray powder (2.28 g).
