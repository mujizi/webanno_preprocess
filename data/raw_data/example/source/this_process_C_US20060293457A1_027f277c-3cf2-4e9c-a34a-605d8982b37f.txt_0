[0015] In another embodiment, the method comprises dynamically curing an elastomer and adding curing agents to the mixture in the amount of 75% to less than 100% by weight of the total weight of curing agents required to process the same materials in a twin screw extruder.
[0016] In the method, the properties of the vulcanizate may be further modified by adding free oil and extender oil in a ratio of oil/thermoplastic polymer of 160:1 to 1:20 at one or more locations before, during or after cure. Likewise, properties can be modified by adding thermoplastic polymer at the feed throat. The method can be practiced wherein a portion of the thermoplastic polymer is added at the feed throat and one or more portions are added in at least one additional locations on the extruder after the addition of curative. Alternatively the method can be practiced wherein thermoplastic polymer is added in at least one location on the extruder before the addition of curative.
[0017] The process as described is capable of providing thermoplastic vulcanizate products having a full range of hardness, e.g., from about Shore A 5 to Shore D 50, where the thermoplastic vulcanizate comprises 2.4% to 85% thermoplastic polymer, where the percentage of thermoplastic polymer used in the thermoplastic vulcanizate is the weight amount of the thermoplastic polymer divided by the total weight of the thermoplastic polymer plus the non-oil extended rubber used in the composition multiplied by one hundred, and wherein the thermoplastic vulcanizate is made using 770 to 2,900 intermeshes-sec-.sup.-1 per L/D at 500 to 850 RPM and a feed rate of 9.54 to 16.22 Kg/(Hr.times.cm.sup.2 free cross sectional area) and 75% to 100% of the curatives needed to mix such a composition in a twin screw extruder. Thermoplastic vulcanizates made using this process can have weight gain from oil absorption from 6 to 200% the total composition weight.
