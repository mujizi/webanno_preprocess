[0045] For example, the optical properties include refractivity or Abbe number (reciprocal dispersion index). The adhesive polymer 30 is coated in a liquid state onto an uneven configuration of an exposed surface P' of the lens section 20 resulting from polymer shrinkage. Thereby, such unevenness of the exposed surface P' is corrected.
[0046] Then, a transparent substrate 25 is adhered to the adhesive polymer 30. Ultraviolet ray is irradiated to the transparent substrate 25 so that the adhesive polymer 30 is cured and adhered integrally to the substrate 25.
[0047] In this process, the adhesive polymer 30 may contract during curing, causing bubbles to remain inside. But due to a small amount of the adhesive polymer 30 and its thickness of .mu.m, the polymer shrinkage and bubble generation do not affect quality of the lens section 20.
[0048] Thereafter, according to the invention, the mold 10 is separated from the lens section to manufacture a lens array (see FIG. 5c).
[0049] In this step, the mold 10 is released from the lens section 20 to produce the lens array 40 having a plurality of lens sections 20 arranged on the side of the substrate 25.
