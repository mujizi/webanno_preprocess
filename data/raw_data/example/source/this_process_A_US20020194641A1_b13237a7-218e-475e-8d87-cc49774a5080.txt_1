[0152] In addition, Example 3 shows additional biochemical data which provides evidence that PUFAs in Schizochytrium are not produced by the classical pathway (i.e., precursor product kinetics between C16:0 and DHA are not observed in whole cells and, in vitro PUFA synthesis can be separated from the membrane fraction--all of the fatty acid desaturases of the classical PUFA synthesis pathway, with the exception of the delta 9 desaturase which inserts the first double bond of the series, are associated with cellular membranes). This type of biochemical data could be used to detect PUFA PKS activity in microbe identified by the novel screening method described above.
[0153] Preferred microbial strains to screen using the screening/identification method of the present invention are chosen from the group consisting of: bacteria, algae, fungi, protozoa or protists, but most preferably from the eukaryotic microbes consisting of algae, fungi, protozoa and protists. These microbes are preferably capable of growth and production of the bioactive compounds containing two or more unsaturated bonds at temperatures greater than about 15.degree. C., more preferably greater than about 20.degree. C., even more preferably greater than about 25.degree. C. and most preferably greater than about 30.degree. C.
[0154] In some embodiments of this method of the present invention, novel bacterial PUFA PKS systems can be identified in bacteria that produce PUFAs at temperatures exceeding about 20.degree. C. preferably exceeding about 25.degree. C. and even more preferably exceeding about 30.degree. C. As described previously herein, the marine bacteria, Shewanella and Vibrio marinus, described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,486, do not produce PUFAs at higher temperatures, which limits the usefulness of PUFA PKS systems derived from these bacteria, particularly in plant applications under field conditions. Therefore, in one embodiment, the screening method of the present invention can be used to identify bacteria that have a PUFA PKS system which are capable of growth and PUFA production at higher temperatures (e.g., above about 20,25, or 30.degree. C.). In this embodiment, inhibitors of eukaryotic growth such as nystatin (antifungal) or cycloheximide (inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis) can be added to agar plates used to culture/select initial strains from water samples/soil samples collected from the types of habitats/niches described below. This process would help select for enrichment of bacterial strains without (or minimal) contamination of eukaryotic strains. This selection process, in combination with culturing the plates at elevated temperatures (e.g. 30.degree. C.), and then selecting strains that produce at least one PUFA would initially identify candidate bacterial strains with a PUFA PKS system that is operative at elevated temperatures (as opposed to those bacterial strains in the prior art which only exhibit PUFA production at temperatures less than about 20.degree. C. and more preferably below about 5.degree. C.).
[0155] Locations for collection of the preferred types of microbes for screening for a PUFA PKS system according to the present invention include any of the following: low oxygen environments (or locations near these types of low oxygen environments including in the guts of animals including invertebrates that consume microbes or microbe-containing foods (including types of filter feeding organisms), low or non-oxygen containing aquatic habitats (including freshwater, saline and marine), and especially at-or near-low oxygen environments (regions) in the oceans. The microbial strains would preferably not be obligate anaerobes but be adapted to live in both aerobic and low or anoxic environments. Soil environments containing both aerobic and low oxygen or anoxic environments would also excellent environments to find these organisms in and especially in these types of soil in aquatic habitats or temporary aquatic habitats.
[0156] A particularly preferred microbial strain would be a strain (selected from the group consisting of algae, fungi (including yeast), protozoa or protists) that, during a portion of its life cycle, is capable of consuming whole bacterial cells (bacterivory) by mechanisms such as phagocytosis, phagotrophic or endocytic capability and/or has a stage of its life cycle in which it exists as an amoeboid stage or naked protoplast. This method of nutrition would greatly increase the potential for transfer of a bacterial PKS system into a eukaryotic cell if a mistake occurred and the bacterial cell (or its DNA) did not get digested and instead are functionally incorporated into the eukaryotic cell.
