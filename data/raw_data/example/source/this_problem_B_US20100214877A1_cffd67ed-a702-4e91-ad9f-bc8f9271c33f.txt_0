[0006] 2. Description of the Prior Art
[0007] As of 2007, there are 33 million people infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide, of which over 70% live in third world countries. An individual infected with HIV has on average several years before HIV matures into the AIDS virus. Regardless of the stage of their infection, patients' lives could be dramatically improved and lengthened through treatment with the most effective antiviral drugs available. However, in developing countries alone, there are 9.7 million patients in immediate need of treatment to stay alive, of which only 3 million receive medicine. Effective antiviral drug treatment of HIV/AIDS is complicated. Drugs are not effective unless taken in strict adherence to a time schedule. Furthermore, like antibiotics, taking drugs partially or out of sequence results in a building resistance by the HIV/AIDS virus; hindering treatment of the patient and, if spread, strengthening the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In a hypothetical treatment regime, a patient may take daily up to four different antiviral pills in addition to pain-killers, vitamins, and medicine for the treatment of Hepatitis; prevalent in those infected with HIV/AIDS.
[0008] Providing these effective treatments to individuals in third world countries is a complex and multi-variable problem. However, whether pharmaceuticals are donated or purchased by relief organizations for patients, there remain barriers for getting treatment to those that need it. Among these issues is the one I am trying to solve: illiteracy and more importantly the inability to tell time. The majority of those infected with HIV/AIDS in third world countries cannot or do not have the means to tell time and therefore do not have the ability to take HIV/AIDS medication correctly or effectively. For instance, in the sub-Saharan country of Chad, of the 105,000 women infected with HIV/AIDS, up to 84,000 have no means of correctly taking complex medical treatments because of illiteracy. Two statistics make this problem so compelling: there are at least 22 million people in third world countries with HIV/AIDS, and nearly every third world country has a literacy rate less than 60 percent. Statistically, that means at least 10 million people are unable to realistically be treated effectively for HIV/AIDS because they cannot tell time
[0009] The inventor first learned of this issue when speaking to Ugandan relief workers recently returned from providing services to impoverished farmers in Africa. To their surprise, doctors informed them that drugs could be made available but that not enough patients lived within range of their clinic to make daily journeys for medicine practical. The underlining issue was the simple fact that there existed no system for them to take their medication accurately, consistently, and independently.
[0010] Therefore, there is a need for a system that assists individuals who cannot tell time from a conventional watch in recognizing the occurrence of an event, such as a notification that it is time to take a medication.
