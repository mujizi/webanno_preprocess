The terms used in this specification generally have their ordinary meanings in the art, within the context of the disclosure, and in the specific context where each term is used. Certain terms that are used to describe the disclosure are discussed below, or elsewhere in the specification, to provide additional guidance to the practitioner regarding the description of the disclosure.
It will be appreciated that same thing can be said in more than one way. Consequently, alternative language and synonyms may be used for any one or more of the terms discussed herein, nor is any special significance to be placed upon whether or not a term is elaborated or discussed herein. Synonyms for certain terms are provided. A recital of one or more synonyms does not exclude the use of other synonyms. The use of examples anywhere in this specification, including examples of any terms discussed herein, is illustrative only, and in no way limits the scope and meaning of the disclosure or of any exemplified term. Likewise, the disclosure is not limited to various embodiments given in this specification.
For purposes of this detailed description, it is envisioned that in one example of use of the invention, a dog will be holding the pet toy in its mouth, and pressing down on the shell layer of the toy with its teeth. During this process, the dog would bite down on the pet toy, which would then produce a crackling noise in addition to a vibration felt by the dog, to provide both audible and tactile feedback to the dog. This description is not meant to limit the scope of the claims, but rather to describe one embodiment of the invention.
Pet toy 20, as shown in FIGS. 1-5, comprises core 22, crackling member or layer 24 and shell 26. Pet toy 20 may take the form of many different shapes. The embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-5 is in the shape of a bone.
In a preferred embodiment as shown in FIG. 4, core 22 has a generally cylindrical, hollow tube shape between first end 40 and second end 42, defining generally cylindrical outside surface 44 and generally cylindrical inside surface 46. In some embodiments, outside surface 44 and inside surface 46 are substantially continuous. It should be understood that, according to the principles of the present disclosure, core 22 can have a variety of configurations. While core 22 is shown as hollow in FIG. 4, in one particular embodiment, core 22 need not be hollow. Core 22 is constructed of a durable material that may also be resilient such as thermoplastic elastomer, silicone, fluorosilicone, polyethylene or a similar elastic material, and may be molded in one or more parts. Core 22 may also be constructed of materials having varying degrees of deformability.
