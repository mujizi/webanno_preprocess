This optical substrate 3 thus has the functionality of both a color filter incorporating the color pattern layer 220, and a microlens array incorporating the lenses 34. As a result, a bright color display can be achieved.
It should be noted that if the third and fourth light transmitting layers 230 and 260 can provide the mechanical strength, gas barrier properties, chemical resistance, and other properties required for the optical substrate, the corresponding first and second reinforcing layers 240 and 270 can be removed. In this case the third and fourth light transmitting layers 230 and 260 become protective films for the first and second light transmitting layers 30 and 210. Moreover, if the light transmitting layers 30, 210 themselves have sufficient strength, the third and fourth light transmitting layers 230 and 260 can also be omitted.
As described above, color recesses 36 and lenses 34 can be easily formed in the light transmitting layer 30 by a transfer process according to the present invention. It is therefore possible by means of this method to achieve highly efficient use of material, a reduction in the number of production steps, and cost reduction.
Furthermore, once manufactured, the first to third masters 10, 20, and 200 can be used repeatedly insofar as durability allows. The steps required to produce the masters can therefore be eliminated from the production process for the second and subsequent optical substrates, thereby further reducing the number of production steps and helping to further reduce cost.
