[0064] To illustrate this computation more fully, suppose a first reaction of silane at flow rate F.sub.1Si and germane at flow rate F.sub.1Ge takes place in a reaction chamber at a steady state temperature T.sub.1 and pressure P.sub.1. The pressure P.sub.1 is controlled primarily by the flow of a carrier gas (e.g., H.sub.2), which is typically much greater than the flow rates of the precursors. The first reaction results in the growth of a silicon germanium film Si.sub.1-xGe.sub.x. From Equation 13, the value of m{T.sub.1, P.sub.1} at the reaction temperature T.sub.1 and pressure P.sub.1 is solved as m .function. ( T 1 , P 1 ) = ( x 1 - x ) 2 .times. ( F 1 .times. Si F 1 .times. Ge ) ( 17 )
[0065] Now suppose a process engineer wishes to conduct a second reaction at the same temperature T.sub.1 and pressure P.sub.1, with silane injected into the reaction chamber at a flow rate F.sub.2Si and germane injected at a flow rate F.sub.2Ge. The second reaction will result in the growth of a silicon germanium film Si.sub.1-yGe.sub.y. From Equation 13, the ratio of the flow rates of the second reaction is given as follows: F 2 .times. Si F 2 .times. Ge = m .function. ( T 1 , P 1 ) .times. ( 1 - y y ) 2 ( 18 ) Substituting Equation 17 into Equation 18 yields F 2 .times. Si F 2 .times. Ge = ( x 1 - x ) 2 .times. ( 1 - y y ) 2 .times. ( F 1 .times. Si F 1 .times. Ge ) ( 19 )
[0066] Prior to conducting the second reaction, the process engineer can select values for two of the three parameters F.sub.2Si, F.sub.2Ge, and y. Then, Equation 19 can be used to calculate the value of the unselected parameter. For example, if a specific value for the germanium concentration y is to be targeted, and if a specific value for the silane flow rate F.sub.2Si is selected, then Equation 19 can be used to calculate the required flow rate F.sub.2Ge of the germane precursor. In another example, if specific flow rates F.sub.2Si and F.sub.2Ge for the precursors are selected, then Equation 19 can be used to determine what will be the germanium concentration y in the silicon germanium film. Alternatively, the value of m can be calculated from Equation 17, and then the germanium concentration y can be calculated from Equation 14 by substituting the values of F.sub.2Si and F.sub.2Ge. This method has been observed to work in the kinetic regime, even at its boundary with the mass transport limited regime.
[0067] Germane gas is typically sold in an impure state, mixed with a carrier gas such as hydrogen. Thus, a source of germane gas is normally given a dilution rating, which is the mass ratio of the germane gas to the total mixture of germane and the carrier. For example, if a source of germane gas has a dilution of 1.5%, the source comprises 98.5% carrier gas. If the flow rate of the germane/carrier mixture is F.sub.Gm and the dilution is d, thenF.sub.Ge=dF.sub.Gm (20)
[0068] Based on this relationship, Equations 13-19 can be rewritten as follows: ( x 1 - x ) 2 = mdF Gm F Si ( 21 ) x = mdF Gm F Si - ( mdF Gm F Si ) 0.5 mdF Gm F Si - 1 ( 22 ) F Si = mdF Gm .function. ( 1 - x x ) 2 ( 23 ) F Gm = ( x 1 - x ) 2 .times. ( F Si md ) ( 24 ) m .function. ( T 1 , P 1 ) = ( x 1 - x ) 2 .times. ( F 1 .times. Si d 1 .times. F 1 .times. Gm ) ( 25 ) F 2 .times. Si F 2 .times.

Gm ) ( 27 ) In these equations, the terms d.sub.1 and d.sub.2 are the dilution ratings of germane sources used in the first and second reactions, respectively. In many cases, the same germane source will be used in successive reactions, in which case d.sub.1 equals d.sub.2 and the ratio d.sub.2/d.sub.1 equals 1. SiGe Control with Temperature Variation
