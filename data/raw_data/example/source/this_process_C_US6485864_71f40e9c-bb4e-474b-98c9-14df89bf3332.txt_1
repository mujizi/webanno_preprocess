To calculate the elemental composition of a surface layer, on the other hand, the integrated intensities of peaks appeared in the boron 1.sub.s spectrum are first calculated. A peak may appear in an asymmetrical form in some instances, and in such a case, its integrated intensity should be calculated by also taking the asymmetry into consideration. As a method for determining the integrated intensities of peaks of boron, it is popular, but not limited, to define the peaks of solid-solution boron, boron carbide and boron nitride components by Gaussian functions, Lorentz functions or the like and then fitting a found spectrum to the thus-defined peaks. To calculate the composition of the surface layer, relative sensitivity coefficients associated with the analyzer are used. In the present invention, calculations were made using the following relative sensitivity coefficients--carbon 1.sub.s : 1.00, boron 1.sub.s : 0.486, nitrogen 1.sub.s : 1.80, and oxygen 1.sub.s : 2.93. When no particular elements other than those mentioned here have been added to graphite, it is sufficient to conduct quantitative calculations on these four elements only. When some graphite particles are coated with an element or compound other than those mentioned above, the thickness of the coating layer should be taken into consideration.
2. Production Process of Silicon-containing Carbonaceous Material
A silicon-containing carbonaceous material is produced by adding silicon or a silicon compound to highly-crystalline graphite, which is selected from a graphitized product of a carbonaceous material and/or natural graphite, or the above-described boron-substituted graphite of the present invention such that the silicon or silicon compound amounts to 0.1 to 30 wt. % of the whole resulting mixture, and then subjecting the mixture to heat treatment at 350 to 1,500.degree. C. in an inert atmosphere, reducing atmosphere or slightly oxidizing atmosphere. Examples of the carbonaceous material useful in this process can include highly-crystalline graphites such as those obtained by carbonizing or graphitizing thermosetting resins, such as phenol resins and furan resins, or coal or petroleum pitch, natural graphite, graphite formed as a decomposition product upon production of Sic, and kish graphite; and carbonaceous materials such as the boron-substituted graphite of the present invention.
On the other hand, illustrative of the silicon or the silicon compound are monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, and silicon oxide. The mixing of the carbonaceous material with the silicon or silicon compound can be conducted in a manner known per se, for example, in a V-type blender or Henschel mixer. The silicon or silicon compound may be added in an amount of from 0.1 to 30 wt. % in terms of silicon element on the basis of the resulting mixture. If the amount is less than 0.1 wt. %, the effects of silicon are not exhibited. If the amount is greater than 30 wt. %, the resulting silicon-containing carbonaceous material has a very large irreversible capacity.
