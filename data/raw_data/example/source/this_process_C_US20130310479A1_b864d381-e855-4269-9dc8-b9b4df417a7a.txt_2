[0027] FIG. 1 illustrates an offset printing apparatus 100 that includes a rotating drum 110 having a silicone surface, such as a silicone rubber or other silicone coated surface. A fountain solution dampening system 170 can be used to coat the surface of drum 110 with a fountain solution. Fountain solution dampening system 170 may supply the fountain solution using any suitable means, including, for example, use of a water chamber, spray nozzle, roller system as shown in FIG. 1, or other suitable method that evenly applies the fountain solution, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,001,889, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Any suitable fountain solution can be used, including Mylan-FS100 in water, Novec 7500, commercially available from 3M corporation, and the like.
[0028] The coated drum 110 then can be imaged at patterning station 120, which may include use of laser patterning, photomask patterning, and the like. An inker unit 130 then applies ink to the patterned, coated roll 110 to provide a suitable ink (cyan, magenta, yellow, black, etc.) to the patterned coated roll and then subsequently subjected to partial cure at radiation partial curing station 140. The image now formed on drum 110 can be transferred to any suitable substrate via nip pressure transfer system 150 in which the imaged substrate travels in the direction of arrow 160 in FIG. 1. An image can be transferred in a one-shot process, or 4 images corresponding to the 4 colors can be transferred in a four-shot process in which case the substrate would travel around the rollers at nip pressure transfer system 150 four times for each transfer. The final image then can be fully cured by application of radiation downstream from nip pressure transfer system 150. The final stage in the offset printing method is cleaning system 180 that cleans the drum for a subsequent image processing method as described above.
[0029] The radiation curable ink supplied at inker unit 130, as stated above, should possess the ability to adhere to drum 110, and not mix with the fountain solution supplied at fountain solution dampening system 170. The radiation curable ink also should be capable of being transferred to the substrate at nip pressure transfer system 150. One feature of a suitable radiation curable ink for use in this process is that the ink composition may have a high viscosity (for example, a viscosity greater than about 25,000 cP at 5/s). Conventional radiation curable ink compositions typically have a low viscosity to enable their application via ink jet printing, but these compositions usually have a low pigment concentration. An embodiment provides a process by which a much higher pigment concentration can be achieved, without gelling, to provide a radiation curable, pigment composition for use in the offset printing system described in FIG. 1.
[0030] FIG. 2 provides a schematic illustration of a system 200 capable of carrying out a method of making such a high pigment loading, radtion curable pigment for use in the inker unit 130. System 200 includes a mixing vessel 210, equipped with a mixing implement or impeller 250. As stated previously, most pigment mixing systems employed in formulating printing inks utilize high shear mixing, but the present inventors discovered that such high shear mixing, e.g., mixing at impeller speeds of about 500 rpm or more, causes undesirable gel formation. At lower impeller speeds, however, it is difficult to adequately mix sufficient pigment into the ink composition, and the pigment particle size may be undesirably large (e.g., greater than 1 .mu.m) for use in the offset printing method described with reference to FIG. 1.
[0031] The mixing vessel 210 can be any continuously stirred batch mixing vessel, including for example, Quadro Ytron.RTM. ZC-1 in-line powder disperser, (available from Quadro, Waterloo, Canada), Hockmeyer high-shear batch disperser, (available from Hockmeyer, Elizabeth City, N.C.), Dispermat.RTM. high-shear batch disperser, (available from VMA-Getzmann GMBH Verfahrenstechnik, Reichshof, Germany), and the like. In an embodiment, the mixing implement 250 may be a low shear mixing impeller, such as an anchor impeller, with an impeller speed of less than 500 rpm, or from about 250 to about 400 rpm, or from about 300 to about 400, or about 360 rpm (or about 37.7 radians/sec). This impeller speed of about 360 rpm corresponds to a tip speed of about 1.5 m/sec for a 3 inch diameter impeller. A high shear impeller may be provided to adequately disperse high density pigments (e.g., >2 g/cm.sup.3), such as TiO.sub.2, cobalt ferrite, magnetite, and the like, into the monomer or oligomer. An anchor type impeller 250 with a powder disperser 210 may be provided having an impeller diameter to tank diameter ratio (D/T) within the range of from about 0.5 to 0.9, or from about 0.5 to about 0.8, or from about 0.6 to about 0.7, can be used for dispersing low density pigments, such as organic pigments. Use of the impeller with the appropriate impeller speed, and D/T ratio may avoid the formation of gels.
