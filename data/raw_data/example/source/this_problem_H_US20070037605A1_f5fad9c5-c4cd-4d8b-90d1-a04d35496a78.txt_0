[0011] Conventional cellular telephones permit users to set the ring tone to a particular volume. This volume, once set, stays the same until reset again. Often, resetting the volume level requires locating the reset function in a complex menu system, and is sufficiently cumbersome that users seldom reset the volume level. Instead volume is typically a set-once-and-leave-it feature.
[0012] This one-ring-tone-volume-fits-all approach has many problems, including the following: [0013] First, the distance between user and the phone can vary considerably during the day, unless one is wearing or carrying the phone on their person. But many people leave their phone on their desk or at other handy locations to avoid having to carry it around. [0014] Second, where the phone is kept can impact the effective ringing volume. That is, if the phone is deep in a purse or briefcase, the sound will be much muted compared to the volume that would result if the phone were resting on a desk. [0015] Third, ambient noise can again impact effective volume. When standing at a trade show or on a noisy street comer the surrounding sound can be enough to drown out most ring tones, particularly if the volume setting was established when the noise level was low. [0016] Fourth, setting the volume to an effective level for the owner may not be enough. The user has to consider the social situation and recognize that others who are nearby might not feel that a particular volume is effective for them. For instance, when one sets a phone down on a conference room table with others nearby, the volume might need to be different. Having a phone ring in church or a movie theatre may particularly undesirable.
[0017] Today, the primary approach to solving this problem has been to offer the user convenient (i.e. fast) means by which to switch back and forth between vibrate, ring, ring & vibrate, and silent modes. One purpose of the present invention is to automate the selection of ring mode (ring, vibrate, silent, or lights), or the selection of the ring volume or strength of vibration or brightness of the lights activated upon ringing, and the length or timing of such signaling (e.g. the length of time the phone should ring before sending the caller to voice mail). This automation is performed by altering the character of the ring signaling in response to a variety of sensed conditions, including the absolute or relative position of the phone, ambient conditions such as darkness or noise levels, adaptive responses to conditions learned from experience, or the satisfaction of conditions expressed by rules specified by the user.
[0018] The following summary provides a simplified introduction to some aspects of the invention as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later, but is not intended to define or delineate the scope of the invention.
[0019] Embodiments of the invention are employed to automate the selection of an appropriate alert notification to signal the arrival of an incoming call directed to a portable telephone; for example, to automatically switch between a cellular telephone's ring and vibrate modes, to potentially activate alert lights upon receiving a ringing signal, and potentially control the strength of the light or vibrate mode. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, many of these operating modes may be automatically controlled by sensing the location of the portable phone, or of persons and objects near to the portable phone, and/or by sensing the characteristics of the environment in which the portable phone is being used, or by detecting the characteristics of the inbound telephone call.
