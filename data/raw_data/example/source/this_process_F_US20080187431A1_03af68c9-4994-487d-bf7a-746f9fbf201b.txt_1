[0110]Additionally, using a similar process, power-turbine section 188 and exhaust collector 190 may be securely fixed to frame 248 through support structures 252, 256. To do so, the weight of engine support 120, power-turbine section 188, and exhaust collector 190 may be lifted from brackets 272 and the sliders 212 engaged to guide tracks 204, 205. This may be done, for example, using jacking bolts 202. After the load is lifted off of them, brackets 272 may be removed from between engine support 120 and the sliders 212 engaged to guide tracks 204, 205. Subsequently, engine support 120 may be lowered onto support structures 252, 256 and securely fixed thereto. Because support structures 252, 256 have substantially the same configurations as support structures 124, 126 on base/support 116, the same mounting features and hardware used to secure engine support 120 to support structures 124, 126 may be used to secure engine support 120 to support structures 252, 256.
[0111]In some cases, to help support gas turbine engine 182 from frame 248, additional supports may be connected between frame 248 and gas turbine engine 182. For example, moveable support 164 may be mounted between support structure 264 and combustor 186 to help support gas turbine engine 182 from frame 248.
[0112]Support system 110 may also be used to support power-turbine section 188 and exhaust collector 190 while they are moved parallel to axis 276 independently of gas producer 184 and combustor 186. This process may involve, for example, (1) releasing engagements between power-turbine section 188 and combustor 186; (2) releasing engagements between exhaust collector 190 and other portions of power system 180; (3) transferring the weight of power-turbine section 188 and exhaust collector 190 to guide tracks 204, 205 by assembling moveable support 271 between guide tracks 204, 205 and power-turbine section 188 using the process discussed above; and (4) sliding power-turbine section 188 exhaust collector 190, and moveable support 271 parallel to axis 276 on guide tracks 204, 205. Using this process, power-turbine section 188 and exhaust collector 190 may be transferred to frame 248 of support 246. To do so, power-turbine section 188 and exhaust collector 190 may be slid on guide tracks 204, 205 until engine support 120 is aligned with support structures 252, 256 in substantially the same manner that engine support 120 aligns with support structures 124, 126 when mounted thereto. Subsequently, power-turbine section 188 and exhaust collector 190 may be secured to frame 248 by using the process described above to transfer the weight of engine support 120, power-turbine section 188, and exhaust collector 190 to support structures 252, 256 and secure engine support 120 to support structures 252, 256.
[0113]Before moving power-turbine section 188 and exhaust collector 190 on guide tracks 204, 205 independently of gas producer 184 and combustor 186, it may be necessary to provide additional support for and/or move gas producer 184 and combustor 186. Additional support may be provided for combustor 186 by engaging moveable support 164 between guide tracks 114 and combustor 186 in the manner discussed above in connection with FIGS. 8A-8C. Additionally, moveable support 162 may be engaged between guide tracks 112 and compressor 187 in the manner discussed above in connection with FIGS. 8A-8C. Subsequently, as described in detail above, compressor 187, combustor 186, and moveable supports 162, 164 may be moved as a unit on guide tracks 112, 114 away from power-turbine section 188 and exhaust collector 190.
[0114]The ability to support and move gas turbine engines 82, 182 and portions thereof in the above-discussed manners may facilitate maintenance of power systems 80, 180 in a number of ways, thereby helping keep power systems 80, 180 available to do work a high percentage of the time. Longitudinally separating sections of gas turbine engines 82, 182 may provide access to internal components for repair. In some cases, longitudinally separating sections of gas turbine engines 82, 182 may also eliminate longitudinal overlap between components of the separated sections so that one or more of the sections may be moved away from longitudinal axes 92, 192 independently of other sections. In circumstances where a gas turbine engine 82, 182 has been separated longitudinally, one or more sections of that gas turbine engine 82, 182 may be moved away from the associated longitudinal axis 92, 192 to improve the access to internal components. Alternatively, one or more sections of a gas turbine engine 82, 182 may be moved away from the associated longitudinal axis 92, 192 independently of other sections to provide access to internal components, without longitudinally separating the gas turbine engine 82, 182.
