Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a printer 10 having a supply station 13 in which a roll 14 of web material 12 is housed in sufficient quantity to print, say, 3 to 5,000 images. The web 12 is conveyed from the supply station 13, through the paper conditioning apparatus 11 into a tower-like printer housing 44 in which a support column 46 is provided, housing four similar printing stations A to D which are arranged to print yellow, magenta, cyan and black images. In addition, a further station E is provided in order to optionally print an additional colour, for example a specially customised colour. The web of paper 12 is conveyed in an upwards direction past the printing stations in turn. The printing stations A to E are mounted in a substantially vertical configuration resulting in a reduced footprint of the printer and additionally making servicing easier. The column 46 may be mounted against vibrations by means of a platform 48 resting on springs 50, 51. After leaving the final printing station E, the image on the web is fixed by means of the image-fixing station 16 and fed to a cutting station 20 (schematically represented) and a stacker 52 if desired. The web 12 is conveyed through the printer by two drive rollers 22a, 22b one positioned between the conditioning station 11 and the first printing station A and the second positioned between the image-fixing station 16 and the cutting station 20. The drive rollers 22a, 22b are driven by controllable motors, 23a, 23b. One of the motors 23a, 23b is speed controlled at such a rotational speed as to convey the web through the printer at the required speed, which may for example be about 125 mm/sec. The other motor is torque controlled in such a way as to generate a web tension of, for example, about 1 N/cm. Referring to FIG. 2, each printing station comprises a cylindrical drum 24 having a photoconductive outer surface 26. Circumferentially arranged around the drum 24 there is a charging device 28 capable of uniformly charging the drum surface, an exposure station 30 which will image-wise and line-wise expose the photoconductive drum surface causing the charge on the latter to be selectively dissipated, leaving an image-wise distribution of electric charge to remain on the drum surface. This so-called "latent image" is rendered visible by a developing station 32 which brings a toner developer in contact with the drum surface 26. The toner particles are attracted to the latent image on the drum surface by the electric field between the drum surface and the developer so that the latent image becomes visible. After development, the toner image adhering to the drum surface 26 is transferred to the moving web 12 by a transfer corona device 34. The moving web 12 is in face-to-face contact with the drum surface 26 over a wrapping angle .omega. of about 15.degree. determined by the position of guide rollers 36. The transfer corona device, being on the opposite side of the web to the drum, and having a high potential opposite in sign to that of the charge on the toner particles, attracts the toner particles away from the drum surface 26 and onto the surface of the web 12. The transfer corona device typically has its corona wire positioned about 7 mm from the housing which surrounds it and 7 mm from the paper web. A typical transfer corona current is about .+-.3 .mu.A/cm. The transfer corona device 34 also serves to generate a strong adherent force between the web 12 and the drum surface 26, causing the latter to be rotated in synchronism with the movement of the web 12. Circumferentially beyond the transfer corona device 34 there is positioned a web discharge corona device 38 driven by alternating current. Thereafter, the drum surface 26 is pre-charged by a corona 40, causing any residual toner which might still cling to its surface to become loosened so that it may be collected at a cleaning unit 42 known in the art. The cleaning unit 42 includes a rotating cleaning brush 43. After cleaning, the drum surface is ready for another recording cycle. After passing the first printing station A, as described above, the web passes successively to printing stations B, C, D and E, where images in other colours are transferred to the web. It is critical that the images produced in successive stations be in register with each other. In order to achieve this, the start of the imaging process at each station has to be critically timed. In the conditioning apparatus shown in FIG. 3, the paper web 12 is unwound from a supply roll 14 and led through an entrance slit 53 into a heating cabinet 54 wherein the paper web 12 follows a curved path defined by a plurality of rollers 100. Between the first and second of said rollers 100, the paper web is in contact with a metal heating drum 55, having a tubular infrared heating source 56 inside. The heating drum may mainly consist of aluminium or copper. In a preferred embodiment, the temperature of the heating drum 55 is sensed by a temperature sensor 85. The signal of this temperature sensor 85 may be fed to an electronic control device 101 to control the output of the infrared heating source 56, especially when the apparatus is in a standby status, i.e. when no paper transport takes place. A fan 57 mounted in a wall of the cabinet 54 expels moist air out of the cabinet 54 while ambient air enters through the inlet slits 58. The heated paper web 12 passes through a slot 59 into a cooling cabinet 60, wherein by means of ventilators 61 and 62 cold dry air is circulated along both sides of the paper web 12, as indicated by the arrows 63 and 64. The cooling box 65 has a tight entrance slit 66 closed by a felt brush and contains heat-exchangers 67 and 68 in which circulating cold water (at a temperature of for example 1.degree. to 7.degree. C.) is passed, through cold water inlets 69 and outlets 70. A reservoir (not shown) is connected to the drain holes 77 of the cooling box 65 to collect condensed water which is then led to a drain. The paper web 12 leaves the cooling box 65 via a tight exit slit 71 and enters a housing 78 containing a sensing means. The paper web 12 follows a curved path into contact with an earthed metal drum 72. This drum may mainly consists of iron or steel. In a preferred embodiment, the drum 72 is kept at a temperature equal to that of the paper web after cooling. This may be achieved by a lamp (not shown) or by cooling, irradiating the drum 72 where it is not covered by the web 12. The paper web 12 then follows the surface of the drum 72, closely adjacent a DC corona discharge unit 73, also referred to as transfer corona. This unit 73 sprays electrical charge on the paper web 12, from which the paper thus receives a predetermined corona charge. The paper web 12 then passes an electrometer head 74, also referred to as (contactless) electrostatic voltage sensor, downstream of the corona discharge unit 73, which measures the remaining charge level as a voltage which is related to the electrical condition of the paper. The signal from the electrometer head 74 passes via a line 102 to the electronic control device 101. The control device 101 processes said signal in accordance with a previous calibration of the apparatus and controls the supply of electrical power via line 103 to the heating source 56 to automatically adjust the heat energy supply in accordance with the remaining charge level sensed by the electrometer 74 to bring the condition of the paper within the desired range. Then the corona current is about 3 .mu.A/cm and the thickness of the paper is about 100 .mu.m, with a weight of 100 g/m.sup.2, for good subsequent toner transfer results the electrometer should typically detect a charge height of at least 500 V. The operation of the electronic moisture control device may be explained as follows. The electrostatic voltage measured by the electrometer 74 will we be lower than the electrostatic voltage generated on the web materiel at the location of the corona discharge unit 73. This is due to the fact that the electrical charge sprayed on the web material by the corona discharge unit 73 partially leaks away via the earthed metal drum 72, due to contacting the drum. The amount of charge leaking away is a function of the time that the web material is in contact with the drum. This time is inversely proportional to the angular velocity of the drum 72 and proportional to the distance between the corona discharge unit 73 and the electrometer head 74. The amount of charge leaking away is also a function of the conductivity of the web material. If the web material has a high conductivity, then the amount of dissipated charge will be high ; a low conductivity will cause a low amount of electrical charge to leak away to the earthed metal drum 72. It has now been found that the conductivity, or more precisely, the amount of charge leaking away per unit of time, is not only a function of the moisture content of the cooled web material, but also a function of the temperature of the cooled web material. It has been found that the conductivity raises with raising temperature, even if the moisture content is kept constant. This causes the following problem in prior art systems. If the temperature of the cooled web material is higher than the reference temperature, e.g. 25.degree. C., then the electrometer 74 will detect a voltage e.g. lower than 360 V, which is considered as being due to a high leakage of charge. The electronic moisture control device 101 may interpret this high leakage as a high moisture content of the web material and accordingly increase the radiant output of the infrared heating source 56 to increase the temperature of the heating drum 55. Since the heated media gets warmer by this extra energy, the media after cooling in the cooling box 65 will also get a higher temperature, e.g. 31.degree. C. This higher temperature of the cooled web material dramatically increases the conductivity measured by the electrometer 74, although the moisture content may have decreased due to the higher temperature of the heated web material in the heating cabinet 54. Therefore, the electronic moisture control device 101 may command an even higher radiant power for the infrared heating source in an attempt to lower the conductivity of the web material 12. It is clear that this system drifts away from its optimal and preferably stable working point. Another disadvantage is that the temperature of the cooled web material as it leaves the housing 78 will not be stable. This may cause the paper length to shrink at higher temperature levels or stretch at lower temperature levels, which may cause problems for subsequent registering of partial colour images transferred by the transfer corona devices 34 or paper length problems in the cutting station 20. Due to variation of the temperature, the ratio of the cutting length to the effective paper size may vary considerably. To avoid the above problems, according to the invention a temperature sensor 81 is located close to the cooled web material, preferably after it left the cooling box 65. In a more preferred embodiment, the temperature sensor 81 is located close to the periphery of the drum 72, where the web material 12 is in contact with the drum. The signal generated by the temperature sensor 81 is transmitted via a temperature sensor line 82 to an electronic temperature control device 83. This control device 83 transmits a signal via a signal line 84 to the cooling box 65 to increase or decrease the cooling power of the cooling box 65. The temperature control device 83 operates in such a manner that the temperature sensed by the sensor 81 is constant or situated within a narrow temperature range of 2.degree. C. or less. If the control device 83 gets a temperature signal indicative of a temperature higher than the predetermined range, then the control device 83 instructs the cooling box to increase the cooling power. If the temperature of the cooled web material is too low, then the cooling power of the cooling box 65 is decreased, such that the web material leaving exit slit 71 gets a higher temperature.
By sensing the temperature of the cooled media and using the temperature signal 82 to control the cooling power of the cooling box 65, the temperature of the web material leaving the cooling box 65 is kept substantially constant. This has two advantages. First of all, the conductivity or electrostatic charge leakage is more closely related to the moisture content of the heated and subsequently cooled media. On the other hand, the temperature of the media leaving the housing 78 is substantially constant, such that other process parameters, which may by highly dependent on the temperature of the media, can be controlled independently from the temperature. As explained before, the length and width of the media may be influenced by the temperature.
The cooling box will produce frigories (i.e. `cold calories`) for cooling the web material. In this process, calories are inevitably generated partly due to the cooling process, partly due to the mechanical and electrical energy losses. In a preferred embodiment, the calories generated by the cooling box 65 may be recuperated by the heating process. This may be done for example by use of a Peltier module such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,519,389 or EP-A- 0 651 308. The cold side or junction of the Peltier module may produce the frigories for the cooling box 65, the hot junction may produce the calories for the heating means 55, or an air flow cooling the hot junction may be guided to the inlet slits 58 of the heating cabinet 54. This way heat energy dissipated or withdrawn from the cooling means 65 may be transported to the heating means 55 and heat energy may be recuperated.
An AC discharge corona 75, also referred to as erase corona, positioned downstream of the electrometer head 74 brings the paper web back to its ground state before it leaves the housing 78 through the exit slot 76. This measure is taken to avoid that the web material 12 sticks to the drum 72 at the point where the material has to leave the drum. The paper web passes from the exit slot 76 directly into the printer shown in FIG. 1. By directly coupling the conditioning unit to the printer, the web drive for the printer serves to drive the paper web 12 from its supply roll 14 through the conditioning apparatus, the paper web being maintained in a tensioned state by the brake 15 acting on the roll 14. The output signal from the electrometer head 74 and from the temperature sensor 81 may alternatively or additionally be fed to a visual indicator from which the operator may check the condition of the paper web. In the alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 4, two spaced electrometer heads 74a and 74b, also referred to as (contactless) electrostatic voltage sensors, are positioned adjacent the paper web path downstream of the corona discharge unit 73. The temperature sensor 81 gives feedback about the temperature of the moving paper web 12. That information is used to control the cooling power of the cooling box 65, such that the temperature of the paper in the housing 78 is kept within a narrow temperature range. At such almost constant temperature, the electrostatic charge leakage, measured by the electrometers 74a and 74b, is more closely related to the moisture content of the cooled paper web material. In this embodiment, the control device (not shown in FIG. 4) compares the signals received from the two electrometers 74a and 74b to determine the rate of decay of electrostatic charge on the paper web. This rate of decay, being indicative of the electrical condition of the paper web, is then used to automatically adjust the heat energy supply in accordance with the rate of charge decay sensed by the electrometer heads 74a, 74b to bring the condition of the paper within the desired range. The embodiment shown in FIG. 4 has the advantage over that shown in FIG. 3, of not requiring previous calibration. Alternatively, the voltage or the electrical current of the corona discharge unit 73 may be controlled by the output signal of the first electrometer 74a, in such a way that the electrostatic voltage sensed by the electrometer 74a has a predetermined constant level of e.g. 500 V. In such case, either the output signal of the second electrometer 74b alone or a difference signal from both electrometers 74a and 74b may be sent to the electronic moisture control device 101. According to that embodiment of the invention, the temperature sensor 81 is preferably located between the first electrometer 74a and the second electrometer 74b. Alternatively, the temperature sensor 81 may be located at any location close to where the web material 12 is in contact with the drum 72.
In an alternative embodiment, the output signal from the temperature sensor 81 may control other portions of the printer 10. Parameters such as cut length, transfer current in transfer corona device 34 and image scales may be varied as a function of the temperature measured by sensor 81. In such case, the temperature may vary for example between 24.degree. C. and 26.degree. C. or higher, without correcting the cooling power of the cooling box 65. The temperature signal 82 may then be fed (not shown) to the electronic moisture control device 101 in order to correct the moisture signal 102 for the higher or lower temperature.
