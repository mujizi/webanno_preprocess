The invention concerns a process for the production of a heat-treated, coarse fiber of polyester-POY, preferably in the form of a weft yarn for a tire cord fabric as well as a polyester fiber produced according to this process.
Serving as starting material for the process according to the invention is a polyester-POY, manufactured on the basis of an at least 90% polyethylene terephthalate, having a titer of 50-300 dtex and 20-50 fibrels.
Automobile tires of known structural type are composed in their essential parts of a stress carrier in the form of cords of synthetic yarns, which are embedded, in the form of a cord web, into rubber. The exterior appearance and, in particular, the running surface, are determined by the rubber.
