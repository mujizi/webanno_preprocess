[0058] Both .DELTA..phi..sub.RF and .theta..sub.RF are adjusted iteratively by the DSP to get the optimum result of A.sub..DELTA..phi.RF=1/{square root}2 exactly from Equation 3.
[0059] Therefore, for a starting setting of .DELTA..phi..sub.RF first adjust the DSB-SC phase shifter 53 .theta..sub.RF of the calibration tone to make I and Q rms levels equal and check Equation 3 if A.sub..DELTA..phi.RF=1/{square root}2 exactly. If A.sub..DELTA..phi.RF=/=-1/{square root}2, change the value of .DELTA..phi..sub.RF by small increments and adjust the DSB-SC phase shift .theta..sub.RF again to make I and Q rms levels equal. Finally, check Equation 3 to see if A.sub..DELTA..phi.RF=1/{square root}2 exactly. If not, repeat the process until A.sub..DELTA..phi.RF=1/{square root}2 exactly. In other words, the steps in this process are equivalent to those shown in FIG. 4B except the final phase adjustment is performed iteratively by the DSP instead of using a look-up table.
[0060] Using this method, the systematic IQ phase error can be calibrated by the DSP 40 independently of the frequency dependent IQ phase error.
[0061] As described in the Background of Invention section, frequency dependent IQ phase errors must also be calibrated and corrected. In another embodiment realized by the present invention, the frequency dependent IQ phase errors may be calibrated in the following manner with reference to FIG. 4C.
[0062] The IQ phase errors due to filter errors in the base band paths (66 and 67) are computed at a frequency F.sub.BB. For a base band calibration tone of Sin(.omega..sub.BB.t) in the transmitter, the corresponding receiver signals are
