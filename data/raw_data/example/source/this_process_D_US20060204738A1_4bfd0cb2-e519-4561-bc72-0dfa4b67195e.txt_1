[0388] iii) Osteoblast Adhesion and Proliferation
[0389] Osteoblast adhesion and proliferation was investigated 1 and 4 days respectively after seeding them on the nanowire and quartz (reference) surfaces. Cell adhesion and proliferation was characterized by trypsinizing the adhered cells on the various surfaces and counting them using a hemacytometer.
[0390] FIG. 7 shows the cell count on various surfaces obtained by a hemacytometer for cell adhesion after 1 day and proliferation after 4 days of seeding. To create the nanowire surfaces, commercially available gold colloids were deposited on the substrate surfaces and the substrates were placed in a CVD furnace and silane gas was flowed in at 480.degree. C. for 10 minutes (short wires) or 30 minutes (long wires). This process produced a dense mat of silicon nanowires (with native oxide shells) at locations where the gold catalysis material was deposited yielding nanowires with dimensions of about 40 nm in diameter and between approximately 1 to 30 .mu.m in length. The high density long nanowire surfaces shown in FIG. 7 comprised nanowires grown for 30 minutes and having a length between about 20 to 30 microns and a density of about 25 wires/micron.sup.2; the high density short nanowire surfaces shown in FIG. 7 comprised nanowires grown for 10 minutes and having a length between about 7 to 12 microns and a density of about 25 wires/micron.sup.2; the low density long nanowire surfaces shown in FIG. 7 comprised nanowires grown for 30 minutes having a length between about 20 to 30 microns and a density of about 5 to 10 wires/micron.sup.2. This data demonstrates that nanowire surfaces supported the highest osteoblast adhesion compared to quartz surfaces. However, surfaces with high density long nanowires showed highest adhesion and proliferation followed by high density short nanowires and low density long nanowires. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that this is because high density long nanowires provide high surface area at a nanolevel which promotes osteoblast adhesion and eventually proliferation.
[0391] Because high density long nanowires provide the highest osteoblast adhesion and proliferation, the remainder of this Example describes the use of these nanowire surfaces for bone biotemplating applications. Further, osteoblast adhesion and proliferation on these nanowires was also investigated using fluorescence microscopy. The adhered and proliferated cells were stained using CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate) and HOESCHT. Both CMFDA and HEOESCHT will stain live cells. CMFDA will stain the cytoplasm green and the HOESCHT will stain the nucleus blue. FIGS. 8A-F show fluorescence microscope images of adhered and proliferated cells on various nanowire surfaces after 1 day (FIG. 8B) and 4 days (FIGS. 8D and F) and on quartz surfaces after 1 day (FIG. 8A) and 4 days (FIGS. 8C and E). Nanowire surfaces show higher osteoblast adhesion compared to quartz surfaces. Further, no nucleus staining was seen at Day 1 on nanowire and quartz surfaces.
