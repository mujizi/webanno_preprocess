In a washing/drying machine which carries out an extraction subsequent to a washing or rinsing of the laundry, part of the liquid used for washing or rinsing remains in the bottom of the drum just after the washing or rinsing. So, when the first spin extractor is used as a part of a washing/drying machine, it is preferable to constitute the operation controller to drain the liquid used for washing and rinsing so that a preset amount of the liquid remains in the bottom of the drum, and the first position of the eccentric load is detected with the liquid remaining there. By this constitution, not only an additional step of supplying liquid for detecting the first position is not required, but also the efficiency of utilizing the liquid is enhanced.
For the weak extraction in the first spin extractor, it is necessary to rotate the drum at a considerably high speed, though not as high as the high speed for extraction, for the weak extraction. So, there is a possibility that an abnormal vibration occurs due to an abnormally large eccentric load. Besides, it is of course preferable to correct the balance of the laundry before detecting the change in the position of the eccentric load for preventing the abnormal vibration more assuredly during the extraction. Therefore, in another preferable mode of the first spin extractor, the operation controller is constituted so that a balancing operation is carried out for redistributing the laundry evenly on the inner peripheral wall of the drum before detecting the first position of the eccentric load.
The balancing operation may preferably include a step of reducing the speed of the drum for a short time at a timing when the eccentric load is at the top of the drum. By this method, laundry articles stacked closer to the axis of the drum fall at this timing because the centrifugal force decreases due to the speed reduction, and the centrifugal force acting on the articles closer to the drum axis becomes smaller than that of gravity.
It is still preferable to perform the balancing operation with a liquid present in the bottom of the drum. The reason is as follows. When a laundry article retains a liquid, the laundry article has a smaller volume than when it is dry. So, by the above-described method, it is easier to clear and retain an open space around the drum axis when the laundry includes a large laundry article such as bedclothes or Japanese Futon, or when the total amount of the laundry is large, so that the laundry articles fall more easily.
In another preferable mode of the first spin extractor, the position detector is constituted so that the position of the eccentric load is detected based on a torque component in a motor current supplied to a motor for rotating the drum. When the speed of a motor is relatively low, the torque component in the motor current can be used as an index that correctly corresponds to the fluctuation in the load torque due to the eccentric load. Therefore, the position of the eccentric load on the inner peripheral wall of the drum is detected based on the fluctuation in the torque component. When the distance between the first and second positions is larger than predetermined, it is concluded that the laundry articles in the laundry have a diversity of extraction qualities.
