[0132] It should be understood that the above-described embodiments of the elongate engagement member 89, and more particularly wire stop members 90, 96, 190, 290, 390, can be utilized to secure a wire guide 11 to any type of elongate medical device 10 having an intermediate side access port 15 in communication with an internal passageway 27. In other words, elongate engagement member 89 can be utilized with rapid exchange, short wire, ultra short wire, and convertible devices. Furthermore, the depicted embodiments represent but a few of the possible types of devices adapted for securing the first elongate medical device 10 and wire guide 11 so that they can be co-introduced through a channel without disengaging therein.
[0133] The present invention and method includes using devices in procedures where once the primary access device is used within the work site, a secondary access device is introduced over the guiding device (wire guide) which has been uncoupled from the primary device within the work site. In the biliary tree, a number of possible devices may be introduced to perform a variety of medical procedures, a few selected examples of which are depicted in FIGS. 9F,14,17,19-22, 27-28, 39, 41-44, 51, and 53. The exemplary devices are certainly not representative of all secondary access devices appropriate for use in the bilary tree, nor is their use particularly limited to being a secondary device used following a primary device. The illustrative devices depict some of the general types of medical devices used endoscopically in the biliary tree, as well as other non-biliary and non-endoscopic procedures performed elsewhere in the body.
[0134] FIG. 17 depicts a system for delivering a biliary or pancreatic drainage stent 69 mounted on a delivery catheter 110 (elongate medical device 10) of the present invention. The illustrative COTTON-LEUNG.RTM. Biliary Stent (Wilson-Cook, Medical Inc.) is mounted on an OASIS.RTM. One Action Stent Delivery System (Wilson-Cook Medical, Inc.), modified for IDE, which extends through the internal lumen 72 of the stent 69, which is slidably mounted thereover (when used with a pusher member 101 (see FIGS. 29a-c). It should be noted that the illustrative stent delivery catheter 110 is configured to accept different kinds of tubular drainage stents in addition to the type shown. The coupling portion 14 of the delivery catheter 110 comprises the passageway 27 between the distal opening 19 and the side access port 15, which is located 1.5-2.0 cm from the distal tip. A proximal marking 18, such as the illustrative iridium band, is located at about 1 cm, just distal to the access port 15. The wire guide 11 exits the side access port 15 at a point distal to the distal end 71 of the stent 69 to advantageously provide a means for withdrawing the stent 69 along with the delivery catheter 110, which greatly assists in the ability to reposition the stent within the duct. When the catheter 10 and wire guide 11 are withdrawn together relative to the stent (which is held stationary by the pusher member), the distal edge 71 of the stent 69, which is slidably positioned over the catheter, lodges in a triangular wedge point 70 formed by the junction of the delivery catheter and the wire exiting therefrom. Thus, the stent 69 is pulled backward along with the delivery catheter, providing the clinician with a simple and reliable means to pull the stent partially out of the duct so that the proximal anchor flaps 73 can extend outside of the duct, if so desired. Once positioned at the desired location, the wire guide 11 and delivery catheter 110 are uncoupled and the latter is withdrawn from the lumen 72 of the stent 69. In delivery systems in which the wire guide 11 extends through the lumen 72 of the stent 69, pulling back on the delivery catheter 110 would not allow the clinician to pull the stent back with it without an additional mechanism to releasably couple the stent to the delivery catheter. It should be noted that this method can be readily adapted for other stent designs as well, particularly other non-expandable tubular stents and those having pusher members.
[0135] The illustrative stent delivery system of FIG. 17 is particularly well-adapted for placement of multiple stents as depicted in the method of FIGS. 29a-e, insomuch that remote uncoupling of the wire guide 11 and apparatus 10 can be performed within the duct, unlike previous biliary stent delivery systems, thereby eliminating the need for recannulating the papilla for each stent placed. As depicted in FIG. 29a, the inner delivery member 110, which is coupled to the wire guide 11, is advanced out of the endoscope 38, through the ampullary orifice 40 and into the duct 41. The wire guide 11 does not extend through the lumen of the stent 69 and pusher member, which is not yet shown. In FIG. 29b, the pusher member 101 urges the stent over the inner member 110 until the distal end 71 thereof reaches the junction 70 formed where the wire guide 11 exits the side access port (alternatively, the inner member 110 and stent 69 can be pulled back while the pusher member 101 contacts the stent and causes it to advance further up over the inner member 110). As noted above, the junction 70 can be used to contact the distal end 71 of the stent and pull back or reposition the stent 69, such as when it had been advanced too far into the duct for ideal deployment. Once the stent 69 is in the proper position for deployment, as depicted in FIG. 29c, the inner member 110 is advanced further into the duct 41 so that there is sufficient room for the uncoupling procedure to take place. The wire guide 11 is unlocked from the wire guide holder 50 (see FIG. 12) and pulled back until it exits the side access port 15, as depicted in FIG. 29d. The inner member 110 is then withdrawn through the stent 69, along with the pusher member 101, and removed from the channel of the endoscope. The wire guide 11 is then re-advanced further into the duct to serve as a conduit for the next stent delivery system, shown in FIG. 29e, such that a second stent 109 can be deployed alongside the first in the manner shown in FIGS. 29a-d. Subsequent deployments of additional stents can be also be made using the same technique over the original wire guide.
[0136] Other stent or prosthesis delivery systems configured for use with the present invention are depicted in FIGS. 22, 27, and 39. FIG. 22 depicts a delivery system 99 for a self-expanding prosthesis 98, which could include a self-expanding stent, such as the Wilson-Cook ZILVER.TM. Biliary Self-Expanding Stent or any nitinol, stainless steel, or other self-expanding stent; artificial valve (e.g., venous, heart, pulmonary, etc.) prosthesis, vessel occluder, filter, embolic protection device, shunt, stent graft, etc. The illustrative apparatus comprises an inner member (elongate medical device 10) on which the prosthesis 98 is mounted and an outer member 100 or sheath which constrains the self-expanding prosthesis 98 until deployment. The side access port 15 is located about 3 cm from the distal tip 12 of the inner member 10 with the coupling region 14 being completely distal to the prosthesis 98.
