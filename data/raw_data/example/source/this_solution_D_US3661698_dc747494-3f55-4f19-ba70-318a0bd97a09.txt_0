A volume of 25 percent ammonium hydroxide solution was then added to the volume for cooks S 246 and S 244 being 100 ml. and for the remainder 250 ml. and the temperature raised by steaming over a period of 25 minutes to 175.degree. C. where it was maintained for a period of 45 minutes, the pressure being raised to 150 psig for the stabilization stage.
In the third or delignifying stage Kraft liquor with a charge of effective alkali set forth in Table I and at a sulphidity set forth in Table I was fed into the bomb the temperature being raised from 155.degree. C. to 170.degree. C. in 15 minutes where it is maintained at a pressure of 120 psig for a period of 60-75 minutes.
The ammonium polysulphide solution used in the impregnation stage was prepared by injecting hydrogen sulphide gas into 2N ammonium hydroxide solution and then dissolving the required amount of elemental sulphur in this solution at 90.degree. C. The composition of the solution is set forth in Table I.
After separating the cooking liquor, disintegrating and screening the pulp through a vibrating flat screen with 0.001 inch slits, the weights of the screen rejects and of the screened pulp were determined. These are summed up as the total pulp yield.
The conditions and results are given in Table I. ##SPC1## ##SPC2##
