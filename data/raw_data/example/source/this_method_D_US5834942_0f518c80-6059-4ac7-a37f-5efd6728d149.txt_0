To this extent, a synthetic fiber cable cannot be compared with a steel cable. Because of the manner in which synthetic fiber cables are manufactured, the above-described method for determining the readiness for replacing cannot be used for the determination of the state of wear of a synthetic fiber cable. Further, the outer sheath prevents visual recognition of fiber or strand fractures.
A synthetic fiber cable, in which one or more electrically conductive indicator fibers are placed into the strands in order to monitor the state of the cable, has been shown in GB-PS 2 152 088. The carbon indicator fiber surrounded by the synthetic fibers and the strand must have the same mechanical properties so that they fail at the same time. A tearing of the fiber may be detected by applying a voltage to the indicator fiber. In this manner, each individual strand of a synthetic fiber cable can be checked and the cable can be replaced when a predetermined number of torn strands have been exceeded.
In the case of the above-mentioned patent, the indicator fibers are arranged so that they tear at the same time as the carrying strands. In the extreme case, an adequate residual fracture resistance is difficult to maintain, since the tearing of an indicator fiber signifies failure of an entire carrying strand, not only an individual fiber of one strand. The time span between an apparently intact cable and a necessary replacement of the cable is very small on the basis of this method. The progress of wear is thus not recognizable. This equipment cannot meet the safety requirements in the elevator construction. Furthermore, diameter reduction of the synthetic fiber cable or wear of the sheath may not be recognized after a great number of bending cycles.
The present invention is directed to recognizing the proper time for replacing synthetic fiber cable used for an elevator, which does not display the aforementioned disadvantages and in which the exchanging of the cables reliably takes place in good time, and not unnecessarily prematurely.
Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is directed to an apparatus for determining when a synthetic fiber cable for an elevator is ready for replacement. The apparatus includes at least one voltage detection unit for detecting a voltage in at least one portion of the synthetic fiber cable, the voltage dependent upon the integrity of the portion of the synthetic cable, at least one threshold device for determining when the detected voltage exceeds a predetermined voltage threshold, wherein exceeding the predetermined voltage threshold is indicative of a failure of the at least one portion of the synthetic cable. The apparatus also includes a device for disabling the elevator when a predetermined number of the at least one threshold device determine that the at least one portion of the synthetic fiber cable has failed.
