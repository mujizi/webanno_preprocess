[1258] FIG. 55 depicts another embodiment in which sonic energy emitter 8034 is external from patient 8030, in contact with the external surface 8050 of patient 8030, and produces sonic energy wave 8040 directed at and focused on target organ 8032. In this embodiment, sonic energy receiver 8054 is inserted into patient 8030, in close proximity to target organ 8032, and opposite from sonic energy emitter 8034 so as to sense sonic energy transmitted through target organ 8032. In another embodiment, not shown, sonic energy receiver 8054 is in contact with target organ 8032.
[1259] As previously described, and referring again to FIGS. 48 and 51-55, in step 9030 the actual resonant frequency of the microtubules of the mitotic spindles of the cells to be treated is determined by sweeping the sonic energy, produced by the sonic energy emitter 8056, through a range of frequencies about the estimated resonant frequency from step 9020 and observing and recording the signal from the sonic energy receiver 8054. It is preferred to sweep from about 50% below the estimated resonant frequency from step 9020 to about 50% above the estimated resonant frequency from step 9020. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, applicants believe that the maximum absorption of sonic energy by the target organ 8032, occurs at the resonant frequency, and therefore, the signal from the sonic energy receiver 8054, which is sensing the sonic energy reflected from and/or transmitted through the target organ 8032, will be a minimum at the resonant frequency. Referring to FIG. 56, there is depicted the signal from the sonic energy receiver 8054 as the frequency of the sonic energy emitter 8056 is swept through the actual resonant frequency 8066. At frequencies well below or well above the actual resonant frequency, the amplitude of the swept frequency sensed by the sonic energy receiver 8054 will be a high value denoted by numeral 8062. As the swept frequency passes through the actual resonant frequency 8066, the signal from the sonic energy receiver 8054 will drop and pass through a minimum value denoted by numeral 8064. Step 9030 may be executed by any of the sonic energy emitter/receiver embodiments depicted in FIGS. 49-55.
[1260] FIG. 57 depicts one example of signals from a sonic energy receiver in step 9060 of FIG. 48. It will be understood that additional signal responses will be possible under various embodiments and conditions. The object of this step is to cause the microtubules of the targeted cells to vibrate to such an extent that the bonds between the microtubules and chromosomes making up the mitotic spindle are broken, thereby preventing malignancy forming cell division. It is to be understood that many embodiments of this process step are possible, for example, any of the sonic emitters and receivers depicted in FIGS. 49-55.
[1261] Referring to FIG. 57, the target organ is insonified with sonic energy from a sonic energy emitter at the actual resonant frequency determined in step 9030 of FIG. 48. The minimum power level of sonic energy at the resonant frequency required to break the microtubule-chromosome bonds is determined by the process depicted in FIG. 57. FIG. 57 depicts the signal from the sonic energy receiver as the target organ is insonified at various power levels. At lower power levels, e.g., 8068 and 8070, the signal from the sonic energy receiver remains constant over time. At a threshold power level 8072, the signal from sonic energy receiver transitions at region 8074 to a higher level 8076. Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, applicants believe transition region 8074 occurs as the microtubule-chromosome bonds are breaking or the microtubules of the mitotic spinal are breaking or disassembling, thereby resulting in decreased absorption of the sonic energy and therefore a higher signal 8076 from the sonic energy receiver. There is no need to increase the power level beyond the minimum level required to break the mitotic spindle. The results depicted in FIGS. 56 and 57 are one possible outcome of the process depicted in FIG. 48. It should be understood that depending upon, the nature of the organ and cells being treated, other outcomes are possible.
[1262] Thus, again referring to FIG. 48, a sonic energy therapeutic regimen 9000 has the potential to act as a monitor of cell division and proliferation in a tumor mass or neoplastic group of cells and thereby can provide the clinician with a valuable set of information not previously available except by surgical biopsy or autopsy. This information can provide insight into the resistance of a group of cells to any conventional treatment and provide information useful to a tailoring of treatments to an individual patient's needs.
