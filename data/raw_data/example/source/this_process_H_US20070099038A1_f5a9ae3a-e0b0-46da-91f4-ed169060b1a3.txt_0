[0047] What has been found was that the syngas was very rich in hydrogen and carbon monoxide--most suitable for a variety of high temperature fuel cells (such as molten carbonate, solid oxide, and similar fuel cells.). And the minor contaminants, such as carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, hydrogen chloride, and polychlorinated organics were identified and a removal system specified.
[0048] It was learned that to achieve a highly pure syngas, with negligible impurities, the pilot experimental work has shown that the syngas must be purified by a combination of high temperature removal steps as well as low temperature condensation steps. This double-prong approach is required because syngas clean-up is quite difficult in order to achieve a clean syngas that can feed either or both of high temperature fuel cells and shift converter and pressure swing absorption unit for hydrogen production. FIG. 1 shows such a process train that corrects scrubber sulfur-compound removal problems by using a high temperature alloy candle filter operating about 500.degree. (900.degree. F.) or higher, so that the soot precursor solids are dropped out early at high temperature avoiding the formation of dioxins and dibenzofurans.
[0049] The significant improvements in this process train compared to that pilot-tested, as discussed earlier, are shown in FIG. 1 below and involve alkali addition to the kiln and the hot filter and getter bed units immediately downstream of the steam reformer. Since soot particles were observed and smelled of naphthalene and its heavier cousins in the scrubber caustic and also on the upstream face of the demister, these heavy polyaromatic solids should be removed early at relatively high temperature so that they do not act as precursors to larger quantities of soot formation downstream in the sections of process that are cooling below 300 to 500.degree. C. (600 to 900.degree. F.), the temperature range over which the "de-novo" synthesis chemistry is active in forming soot, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins and furans.
[0050] The added getter bed (hot iron oxide, zinc oxide, or equivalent) would function as an active getter bed to trap and destroy low molecular weight sulfur compounds such as carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide as well as halogen-, silicon-, nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing compounds. These compounds are not very acidic and therefore are not efficiently removed in a chilled caustic scrubber system. Thus, they should be removed earlier in a getter bed-type unit at the higher temperature where they can efficiently react.
[0051] Following the getter bed, a water-cooled heat exchanger/boiler is shown that will rapidly quench-cool the syngas down from 300 to 500.degree. C. (600 to 900.degree. F.) temperature of the getter bed down to 150.degree. C. (300.degree. F.). The concept here is to rapidly quench the syngas so that the undesirable heavy hydrocarbon recombination reactions (i.e. "De-Novo") do not have time to form, since they are kinetically limited. These recombination reactions involve multi-step polymerization &/or ring formation that are slowed as the temperatures are lowered.
