[0061] Also, to alleviate any thermal drifts of the output voltage, the InSb semiconductor can be doped with Si or Te donors so that an extrinsic carrier concentration in the saturation (e.g., temperature independent) range is achieved.
[0062] Also, the inventors note that as the size of the EOC sensor decreases, a point will be reached where the illumination caused by the light perturbation source becomes effectively uniform over the EOC sensor. This uniformity would operate to effectively integrate the plot of FIG. 4 over the X position, which results in a significant decrease in the strength of the voltage response from the EOC sensor.
[0063] One solution to this problem is to asymmetrically position the leads 110 and/or 112 along the x-axis. In one embodiment, such asymmetrical positioning can be achieved by asymmetrically positioning only the voltage leads 112 along the x-axis. FIG. 6 depicts a top view of an exemplary EOC sensor 100 showing the semiconductor portion 102, the metal shunt portion 104, and the voltage leads 112.sub.1 and 112.sub.2 (corresponding to the leads V.sub.2 and V.sub.3 from FIG. 3 respectively). The positions of the voltage leads 112 along the x-axis are shown in FIG. 6, wherein the full distance along the x-axis for the semiconductor 102 is shown by X.sub.max. Using the leftmost position along the x-axis in FIG. 6 as the origin and the rightmost position along the x-axis as the value X.sub.max, it can be seen that the x-axis position of voltage lead 112.sub.1 is represented by x.sub.1, and that the x-axis position of voltage lead 112.sub.2 is represented by x.sub.2. The voltage leads are said to be symmetrical if x.sub.1 and x.sub.2 exhibit values such that x.sub.2=X.sub.max-x.sub.1. To improve the voltage response of the EOC sensor 100, it is preferred that the voltage leads 112 be asymmetrically positioned along the x-axis.
[0064] The voltage potential V.sub.23 between voltage leads 112.sub.1 and 112.sub.2 shown in FIGS. 3 and 6 can be calculated as the integral of the surface charge density over the distance to the charge:
