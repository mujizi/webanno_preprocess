(C) collecting said multicomponent fibers of Step (B) to form a non-woven web; and
(D) contacting said non-woven web with water to remove said sulfopolyester thereby forming a microdenier fiber web.
[0197] The process also preferably comprises prior to Step (C) the step of hydroentangling the multicomponent fibers of the non-woven web. It is also preferable that the hydroentangling step results in a loss of less than about 20 wt. % of the sulfopolyester contained in the multicomponent fibers, more preferably this loss is less than 15 wt. %, and most preferably is less than 10 wt. %. In furtherance of the goal of reducing the loss of sulfopolyester during hydroentanglement, the water used during this process preferably has a temperature of less than about 45.degree. C., more preferably less than about 35.degree. C., and most preferably less than about 30.degree. C. It is preferable that the water used during hydroentanglement be as close to room temperature as possible to minimize loss of sulfopolyester from the multicomponent fibers. Conversely, removal of the sulfopolyester polymer during Step (C) is preferably carried out using water having a temperature of at least about 45.degree. C., more preferably at least about 60.degree. C., and most preferably at least about 80.degree. C.
[0198] After hydroentanglement and prior to Step (C), the non-woven web may under go a heat setting step comprising heating the non-woven web to a temperature of at least about 100.degree. C., and more preferably at least about 120.degree. C. The heat setting step relaxes out internal fiber stresses and aids in producing a dimensionally stable fabric product. It is preferred that when the heat set material is reheated to the temperature to which it was heated during the heat setting step that it exhibits surface area shrinkage of less than about 5% of its original surface area. More preferably, the shrinkage is less than about 2% of the original surface area, and most preferably the shrinkage is less than about 1%.
[0199] The sulfopolyester used in the multicomponent fiber can be any of those described herein, however, it is preferable that the sulfopolyester have a melt viscosity of less than about 6000 poise measured at 240.degree. C. at a strain rate of 1 rad/sec and comprise less than about 12 mole %, based on the total repeating units, of residues of at least one sulfomonomer. These types of sulfopolyesters are previously described herein.
