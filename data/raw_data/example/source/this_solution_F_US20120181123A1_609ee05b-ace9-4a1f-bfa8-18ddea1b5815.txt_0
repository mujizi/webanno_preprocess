[0006] Conventional piston nose designs that attempt to limit thermal conductivity exist. These conventional designs include features to reduce conductive heat transfer through material choice (e.g., stainless steel, titanium or ceramic) and/or by using structures with reduced cross section.
[0007] One conventional design, shown in FIGS. 1-3 uses a simple design involving a ceramic nose 10 attached to an aluminum piston body 12. Generally speaking, this design simply relies on choice of material (ceramic) to reduce the thermal conductivity. Another conventional design, shown in FIGS. 4-6, uses a titanium nose 20 attached to an aluminum piston body 22. However, in addition to using a low-thermal-conductivity material (titanium) for the nose 20, this design also reduces thermal conductivity by shaping the nose 20 so as to reduce contact area between the piston and the brake pad, i.e., using only an outer ring 24 as the contact surface and drilling holes 25 through the ring 24. In existing implementations of piston nose 20, ring 24 is 5 or 8 millimeters (mm) high and has holes 25 that are 3 or 5 mm in diameter, respectively.
[0008] Finally, in another conventional design (not shown), heat transfer is addressed by using a thin, typically 1 mm thick, sheet of low-thermal-conductivity material, such as stainless steel or titanium, between the piston and the high-strength steel backing of the brake pad. Unfortunately, the present inventors have discovered that the problem with this solution is that this thin sheet of low-thermal-conductivity material typically becomes distorted due to high temperatures and non-uniform force imparted by the piston nose. When that occurs, the plate is no longer flat, but instead appears wavy. In addition, the present inventors have discovered that this thin layer of metallic material exhibits a spring-like characteristic, acting like a compressible spring, and thereby requiring a longer or variable distance to be traveled by the piston before direct force is exerted on the brake pad. This delay in piston force being realized on the back of the brake pad unfavorably affects brake system performance by increasing the time required to engage the brakes and the distance the brake pedal has to travel.
[0009] The present invention addresses this problem by, among other things, using a top surface that both is wide and includes a small, slightly raised portion.
[0010] Thus, one embodiment of the invention is directed to a brake piston that includes a piston body and a top surface, in which the top surface is wider than the piston body and has a small portion that is slightly raised, relative to the rest of the top surface, so that when in use only the small raised portion makes contact with a backing plate of a brake pad.
