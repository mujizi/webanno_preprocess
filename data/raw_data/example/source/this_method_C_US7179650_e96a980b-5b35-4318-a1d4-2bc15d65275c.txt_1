A further aspect of the invention involves a method of detecting a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme polypeptide. The method generally involves contacting the polypeptide with an amount of a sentrin-1 polypeptide composition effective to bind the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme polypeptide, and detecting the complexes so bound.
Also provided is a method of detecting a PML polypeptide. This method generally involves contacting the polypeptide suspected of being a PML polypeptide with an amount of a sentrin-1 polypeptide composition effective to bind the polypeptide, and detecting the complexes so bound. The method may typically involve obtaining a sample suspected of containing a sentrin polypeptide; contacting the sample with a first antibody that specifically binds to a sentrin polypeptide under conditions effective to form an immune complex; and detecting the immune complex so formed.
Another aspect of the invention is a method of inhibiting or preventing TNFR- or Fas/Apo-1 induced apoptosis in a cell. This method typically involves administering to a mammal, such as a human, a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of a sentrin polypeptide composition effective to inhibit or prevent the apoptosis.
A method of inhibiting or modulating sentrin polypeptide function in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal a composition comprising an antibody that specifically binds a sentrin polypeptide.
A method of determining the aggressiveness of a tumor, comprising determining the amount of a sentrin polypeptide produced by a cell and comparing the amount so produced with a normal cell wherein overexpression of the protein is indicative of the aggressiveness of the tumor.
