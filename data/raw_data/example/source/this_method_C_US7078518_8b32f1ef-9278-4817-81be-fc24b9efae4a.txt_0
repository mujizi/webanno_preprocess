It has been discovered that 5-azacytidine exists in at least eight different polymorphic and pseudopolymorphic crystalline forms, and also in an amorphous form.
Form I
A single sample of the 5-azacytidine drug substance was synthesized from 5-azacytosine and 1,2,3,5,-Tetra-O-acetyl-.beta.-D-ribofuranose according to the prior art method provided in Example 1. The last step of this method is a recrystallization of the crude synthesis product from a DMSO/methanol co-solvent system. Specifically, the crude synthesis product is dissolved in DMSO (preheated to about 90.degree. C.), and then methanol is added to the DMSO solution. The co-solvent mixture is equilibrated at approximately -20.degree. C. to allow 5-azacytidine crystal formation. The product is collected by vacuum filtration and allowed to air dry.
The X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD; see Example 5) pattern of the resulting 5-azacytidine is shown in FIG. 1 along with some of the 2.theta. values. Table 1 provides the most prominent 2.theta. angles, d-spacing and relative intensities for this material, which is designated as Form I:
