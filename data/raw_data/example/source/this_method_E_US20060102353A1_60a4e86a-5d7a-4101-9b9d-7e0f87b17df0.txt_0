[0010] A traditional method of managing the temperature of thermal components in a downhole tool using a heat exhausting system involves modest environmental temperatures such that the electronics operate at a temperature above the environmental temperature. In modest environments, the electronics may be thermally connected to the tool housing. The thermal connection allows the heat to dissipate to the environment by the natural heat transfer of conduction, convection, and/or radiation. This approach is limited by the temperature gradient between the electronics and the environment.
[0011] A traditional method of managing the temperature of thermal components in a downhole tool using a heat storage system in harsh thermal environments is to place the electronics on a chassis in an insulated vacuum flask. The vacuum flask acts as a thermal barrier to retard heat transfer from the downhole environment to the electronics. However, thermal flasks are heat storage systems that only slow the harmful effects of thermal failure. Because of the extended periods downhole in both wireline and drilling operations, insulated flasks may not provide sufficient thermal management for the electronic components for extended periods. Specifically, the flask does not remove the heat generated internally by the electronic components. A thermal mass, such as a eutectic material, can be included in the flask to absorb heat from the downhole environment as well as the heat generated internally by the electronics. However, both the thermal flask and the thermal mass are only used to thermally manage the temperature of the interior of the electronics compartment. Because the discrete components may internally generate heat, they may remain at a higher temperature than the average temperature of the interior of the electronics compartment. Thus, although the average temperature of the interior of the compartment may remain at a desired level, discrete components may exceed their desired operating temperatures.
[0012] Another temperature management method for downhole electronics proposes a vapor compression temperature management system using water or other suitable liquid; e.g., FREON.RTM.. In this method, liquid in one tank is thermally coupled with the electronics chassis of the downhole tool. The liquid absorbs heat via the heat exchanger from the downhole environment and the electronics, where the electronics are isolated from the liquid, and begins to vaporize. For example, water would begin to vaporize at 100.degree. C. so long as the pressure of the tank is maintained at 1.01.times.10.sup.5 Pa (14.7 psi). To maintain the pressure, the steam is removed from the tank and compressed and stored in a second tank, which is at or near the temperature of the downhole environment. However, sufficient steam must be removed from the first tank with a compressor to maintain the pressure at 1.01.times.10.sup.5 Pa. Otherwise, the boiling point of the liquid will rise and thus raise the temperature of the electronics chassis in the first tank.
[0013] In practice, vaporization temperature management has significant problems. First, a compressor must be supplied that is able to compress the vapor to a pressure greater than the saturation pressure of the vapor at the temperature of the downhole environment; e.g., 1.55.times.10.sup.6 Pa (225 psi) at 200.degree. C. for water. Second, the method does not isolate the thermal components but instead attempts to cool the entire electronics region. While the average temperature of the region may remain at 100.degree. C., the temperature of the discrete electronic components may be higher because they may internally generate heat. Additionally, due to the typically low efficiency of most temperature management systems and the typically relatively high amount of heat to be extracted, substantial power may be required by the system. This power is typically provided from downhole power generation devices such as turbine alternators. However, the downhole power generation devices are typically powered by drilling fluid being pumped through the inside of the drill string during drilling. At times during the drilling process, the pumping may be stopped to perform various tasks such as adding pipe to or removing pipe from the drill string. When the pumping is stopped, the downhole power generation devices are unable to supply power to the heat exhausting temperature management system. Thus, although temperature management is still required, those heat exhausting temperature management systems that require a source of power are unable to cool the thermal components when pumping is stopped because of the loss of power. Even if batteries are provided downhole, they are limited in the duration for which they can provide power to the heat exhausting temperature management system.
[0014] Another temperature management method proposes a sorbent temperature management system. This method again uses the evaporation of a liquid that is thermally connected via heat exchanger with the thermal components to manage the temperature of the components. Instead of using a compressor to remove the vapor, this method uses desiccants in a second tank to absorb the vapor as it evaporates in a first tank, thus providing heat storage while requiring no input power. However, the desiccants must absorb sufficient vapor in order to maintain a constant pressure in the first tank. Otherwise, the boiling point of the liquid will rise as the pressure in the lower tank rises.
