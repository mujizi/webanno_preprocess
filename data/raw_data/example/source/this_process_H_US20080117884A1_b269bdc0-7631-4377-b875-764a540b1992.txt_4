[0303]FIG. 25 shows a process for switching connection of the terminal 101c to a mobile communication network which is performed when the terminal 101c in cell L2 of the wireless LAN network moves to cell M1 while communicating with the wireless LAN network after connection over the wireless LAN network has been established.
[0304]Referring to FIG. 15, the terminal 101c determines whether it has detected a wireless LAN or a mobile communication network. When the terminal 101c enter cell M1, the terminal 101c detects the mobile communication network, therefore a process for establishing a 3G link is initiated and a link between a radio network controller 104 and the terminal 101c through a base station 102a is established (S1510). Here, Radio Link Setup procedure described in NBAP (Node B Application Part) in 3GPP TS 25.433 is used.
[0305]Then, the terminal 101c performs an Active Set update process for updating cell location (S1511). In this process, first the terminal 101c sends a cell update request 2502 to the radio network controller 104. In this embodiment, the cell update request 2502 is the Cell Update in 3GPP TS 25.331. However, the SRNS Relocation procedure may be used if switching to another radio network controller 104 is involved, or the URA (UTRAN Registration Area) Update procedure may be used if the position of the terminal 101c is tracked on URA level, including the case of no communication being performed. In either case, the same advantageous effects as those of the present embodiment can be achieved.
[0306]When the radio network controller 104 receives the cell update request 2502, the radio network controller 104 change the active set and the semi-active set in the terminal information management section 202 to M1 and L1, respectively, and sends a cell update response 2503 to the terminal 101c. With this, the movement of the terminal 101c into cell M1 is registered in the radio network controller 104.
[0307]Returning to FIG. 15, the terminal 101c determines whether it has moved to the mobile communication network while still connecting with the wireless LAN network (S1512). Since the mobile terminal 101c detected the mobile communication network while connecting with the wireless LAN network in this embodiment, the terminal 101c updates RA (S1513). In the RA update process, the terminal 101c registers with the packet controller 106 and switches packet transfer link from the wireless LAN network to the mobile communication network. With this, information in the terminal state management section 1402 in the packet controller 106 changes from WLAN to 3G.
