[0164] The various display methods and ELISA assays can be used to screen for shuffled antigens with improved properties such as presentation of multiple epitopes, improved immunogenicity, increased expression levels, increased folding rates and efficiency, increased stability to factors such as temperature, buffers, solvents, improved purification properties, etc. Selection of shuffled antigens with improved expression, folding, stability and purification profile under a variety of chromatographic conditions can be very important improvements to incorporate for the vaccine manufacturing process.
[0165] To identify recombinant antigenic polypeptides that exhibit improved expression in a host cell, flow cytometry is a useful technique. Flow cytometry provides a method to efficiently analyze the functional properties of millions of individual cells. One can analyze the expression levels of several genes simultaneously, and flow cytometry-based cell sorting allows for the selection of cells that display properly expressed antigen variants on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm. Very large numbers (>10.sup.7) of cells can be evaluated in a single vial experiment, and the pool of the best individual sequences can be recovered from the sorted cells. These methods are particularly useful in the case of, for example, Hantaan virus glycoproteins, which are generally very poorly expressed in mammalian cells. This approach provides a general solution to improve expression levels of pathogen antigens in mammalian cells, a phenomenon that is critical for the function of genetic vaccines.
[0166] To use flow cytometry to analyze polypeptides that are not expressed on the cell surface, one can engineer the recombinant polynucleotides in the library such that the polynucleotide is expressed as a fusion protein that has a region of amino acids which is targeted to the cell membrane. For example, the region can encode a hydrophobic stretch of C-terminal amino acids which signals the attachment of a phosphoinositol-glycan (PIG) terminus on the expressed protein and directs the protein to be expressed on the surface of the transfected cell (Whitehom et al. (1995) Biotechnology (N Y) 13:1215-9). With an antigen that is naturally a soluble protein, this method will likely not affect the three dimensional folding of the protein in this engineered fusion with a new C-terminus. With an antigen that is naturally a transmembrane protein (e.g., a surface membrane protein on pathogenic viruses, bacteria, protozoa or tumor cells) there are at least two possibilities. First, the extracellular domain can be engineered to be in fusion with the C-terminal sequence for signaling PIG-linkage. Second, the protein can be expressed in toto relying on the signalling of the host cell to direct it efficiently to the cell surface. In a minority of cases, the antigen for expression will have an endogenous PIG terminal linkage (e.g., some antigens of pathogenic protozoa).
[0167] Those cells expressing the antigen can be identified with a fluorescent monoclonal antibody specific for the C-terminal sequence on PIG-linked forms of the surface antigen. FACS analysis allows quantitative assessment of the level of expression of the correct form of the antigen on the cell population. Cells expressing the maximal level of antigen are sorted and standard molecular biology methods are used to recover the plasmid DNA vaccine vector that conferred this reactivity. An alternative procedure that allows purification of all those cells expressing the antigen (and that may be useful prior to loading onto a cell sorter since antigen expressing cells may be a very small minority population), is to rosette or pan-purify the cells expressing surface antigen. Rosettes can be formed between antigen expressing cells and erythrocytes bearing covalently coupled antibody to the relevant antigen. These are readily purified by unit gravity sedimentation. Panning of the cell population over petri dishes bearing immobilized monoclonal antibody specific for the relevant antigen can also be used to remove unwanted cells.
[0168] In the high throughput assays of the invention, it is possible to screen up to several thousand different shuffled variants in a single day. For example, each well of a microtiter plate can be used to run a separate assay, or, if concentration or incubation time effects are to be observed, every 5-10 wells can test a single variant. Thus, a single standard microtiter plate can assay about 100 (e.g., 96) reactions. If 1536 well plates are used, then a single plate can easily assay from about 100 to about 1500 different reactions. It is possible to assay several different plates per day; assay screens for up to about 6,000-20,000 different assays (i.e., involving different nucleic acids, encoded proteins, concentrations, etc.) is possible using the integrated systems of the invention. More recently, microfluidic approaches to reagent manipulation have been developed, e.g., by Caliper Technologies (Palo Alto, Calif.).
