The apparatus of the present invention is capable of folding one or both ends of the cut segment in a non-tension condition. Thus, a stretch material will not change its length when having one or both ends folded by the apparatus of the present invention as may occur with the apparatus of our aforesaid application.
Furthermore, in forming belt loops on pants, it is sometimes desired to sew the ends of the cut segment directly to the pants without an overlapping or folded relation at either end of the cut segment. At the same time, it is desired to be able to fold over one or both ends of the cut segment after it has been sewn to the pants. This requires the cut segment to have a loop or slack portion intermediate its ends at the time that it is initially sewn to the pants.
The apparatus of the present invention satisfactorily solves this problem through forming a cut segment with a loop or slack portion between two clamped portions of the cut segment. With this arrangement, the free ends of the cut segment are attached to the other material such as pants, for example. This results in the loop or slack portion being between the sewn ends of the cut segment. Then, when one or both ends of the material is folded over to form a completed belt loop so that no stitches will be visible, the slack or loop portion of the cut segment enables the belt loop to fit smoothly against the pants, for example.
The apparatus of the present invention is capable of having one of the free ends folded while still having the slack or loop portion formed in the cut segment. Therefore, when the cut segment is used as a belt loop for pants, the folded end of the cut segment could be sewn to the pants to function as the lower portion of the belt loop with the other end of the cut segment being sewn to the pants to function as the upper end of the belt loop. Then, the folding over of the material forming the pants with the upper end of the belt loop would enable the belt loop to be finished without any showing of the stitches at the upper end of the belt loop.
The appatatus of the present invention is capable of forming a belt loop of any selected length with the slack or loop portion of the cut segment being adjustable as to its size. Therefore, the user is able to obtain a cut segment of a selected length with a selected amount of loop or slack therein for attachment to other material such as a pair of pants with the cut segment functioning as a belt loop.
