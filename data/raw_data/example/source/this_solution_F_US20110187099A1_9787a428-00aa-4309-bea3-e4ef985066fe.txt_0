[0060] It is possible to use a scraping agitator in order to improve the intermixing of the fluids in container 1 (see FIG. 1B). Furthermore, to support the intermixing of the fluid in container 1, it is possible to employ double-motion agitators, as shown in FIG. 1C. The dispersion machine 4 is connected at the container floor of container 1 and draws the product from container 1 pumping it via the recirculation line 10, which is located outside of the container 1, back into the container. The product can be recirculated into the container, as shown in the respective FIG. 1 above, from above the fluid level.
[0061] On the other hand, the product can also be recirculated to the container 1 from below the fluid level, as demonstrated by the lines in FIG. 1 that extend laterally of the recirculation line 10 into the container 1. The dispersion machine 4, which is mounted below container 1, is configured for the production of flowable materials, such as, for example, emulsions or suspensions. In what follows below these will be designated by the terms "dispersion" or "fluid" and in part also "product."
[0062] In the installations that are depicted in the FIGS. 1A to 1C the rotor-stator dispersion machine is disposed coaxially relative to the longitudinal axis of the container 1. FIG. 1D demonstrates a solution from the prior art in which the rotor-stator dispersion machine 4 is disposed at an angle of inclination of more than 90.degree. to 120.degree. relative to the longitudinal axis of the container 1. This configuration creates major problems due to bending stresses within the dispersion machine. But the rotating movement of the fluid that the fluid brings with it when transitioning from the container into the rotor-stator dispersion machine is only throttled slightly. FIG. 1E shows a rotor-status dispersion machine that is disposed at an angle of 90.degree. relative to the longitudinal axis of container 1. But, due to the fact that the fluid is redirected in this configuration, this solution as set forth in this example from the prior art suffers from the disadvantage of reduced suction power by the rotor-stator dispersion machine 4.
[0063] However, especially rotor-stator dispersion machines with high suction power tend to set the fluid that is drawn from the container 1 into a rotating motion, which reduces the dispersion performance. For an emulsion this means, for example, a broader drop-size distribution. Regarding lower fluid levels in container 1, these conditions will result in the formation of vortices that will in an undesired fashion also draw air into the product. The intermediate piece 2 according to the invention serves to prevent this disadvantageous fluid rotation during the transition from container 1 to the rotor-stator dispersion machine 4.
[0064] FIG. 2 shows an apparatus according to a first embodied example according to the invention in which an intermediate piece 2 is disposed at the location of the transition of container 1 and the rotor-stator dispersion machine 4. The rotor-stator dispersion machine 4 comprises a housing 40 inside which a rotor 41 and a stator 42 are coaxially disposed relative to each other. The rotor 41 is rotably supported on a shaft 115 and can be driven by a motor 116. The container 1 transitions in the area of the container floor 14 into the outlet 12 of the container. The intermediate piece 2 is connected with the container in the area 13, which is the container wall that is adjacent to the container wall of floor 14 of outlet 12, as indicated in FIG. 2 by the flange connection.
