[0203]Powder having a main component close to Nd.sub.2Fe.sub.14B and a particle size of 1 to 20 .mu.m was pre-molded in a magnetic field in an inert gas atmosphere or in vacuum at 500 to 1000.degree. C., and a fluorine compound precursor solution of DyF.sub.3 was impregnated in or coated on the molding. The solution entered into the molding along the grain boundaries, part of the grain boundaries were covered with the precursor.
[0204]Then, the impregnated or coated molding was sintered at a temperature higher than the above temperature, and was subjected to heat treatment at a lower temperature to increase a coercive force. As a result, a sintered body containing fluorine, rare earth elements Dy, alkali metals or alkaline metals for constituting the precursor was obtained. A feature of this process is to form a rare earth element rich phase on part or entire of the surface of the magnetic powder, followed by forming gaps of 1 nm or larger between the magnetic powder except the contact points, without complete sintering, and to fill the gaps with the precursor of the fluorine compound of Dy by impregnation or coating. As a result, part of the magnetic powder in the molding is covered with the precursor of the fluorine compound.
[0205]According to this process, it is possible to coat the magnetic powder with the precursor even in the center portion of the sintered body having a size of 100 mm. By using heavy rare earth element such as Dy, Tb, etc, the heavy rare earth element was segregated in the vicinity of grain boundaries of the sintered body.
[0206]It was possible to improve coercive force, rectangularity and residual magnetic flux density, to reduce a temperature coefficient of coercive force and of residual magnetic flux density, or to reduce deterioration of magnetic properties caused by machining.
[0207]Segregation of the heavy rare earth element takes place within a range of 1 to 100 nm from the grain boundaries, and the width changes depending on heat treatment temperatures. The width tends to spread at a specific point such as grain boundary triple point.
