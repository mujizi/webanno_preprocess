It is important, for maximum efficiency of the degassing operation, that the lower entry end to the snorkel be placed at a depth within the ladle sufficient to ensure that none of the slag layer floating on top of the molten metal enters the snorkel and is drawn into the vacuum chamber, but at the same time the entry to the snorkel should not be placed so deep as to reduce thereby the efficiency of the degassing owing to an excessive amount of metal being degassed during any particular cycle.
It is therefore important to obtain a clear indication of the position of the interface between the molten metal and the slag within the ladle so that the opening to the snorkel can be positioned just sufficiently below the interface to ensure that no slag enters the snorkel.
In order to obtain a clear indication of the position of the interface an electrode, placed at a fixed position within the ladle, either in the stopper rod in the case of a bottom pour ladle, or within the wall of the ladle, as disclosed in the copending application, is not satisfactory as no account can be taken of neither variation in the level of the molten metal within the ladle, or variation in thickness of the layer of slag. This problem did not exist with the arrangement of the copending application which was concerned with teeming operations from a ladle where it was only necessary to determine when the level of molten metal had dropped to a specified height within the ladle, and, as this position was a fixed position, an electrode fixed at the required position was all that was necessary.
In order to meet the problem of locating the interface in a vacuum degassing application it has been found that an electrode can be utilised if the electrode is mounted independently of the ladle and is adapted to be raised and lowered within, and relative to the ladle.
Therefore, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention as applied to a vacuum degassing operation, an electrode is supported within, but independently of, the ladle, and is adapted to be raised and lowered within, and relative to, the ladle, whereby, after the electrode being moved to a position within the ladle, subsequent relative vertical movement between the electrode and the ladle itself causes the electrode to contact the upper surface of the slag layer within the ladle to provide a voltage within a first voltage range indicative of the electrochemical reaction between the slag and the electrode and such voltage will be maintained upon continuation of the relative movement whilst the electrode is in contact with the slag, but upon contact occurring between the molten metal and the electrode at the interface between the slag and the molten metal a new voltage within a second range of voltages will be generated thus establishing the position of the interface. The thickness of the slag layer can then be determined by computing the amount of relative movement that has occurred and the opening to the snorkel of the degassing chamber can then be positioned at such a depth within the molten metal to ensure that no slag is drawn into the degassing chamber.
