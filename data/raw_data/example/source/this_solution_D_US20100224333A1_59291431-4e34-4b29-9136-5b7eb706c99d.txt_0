[0040] In at least one embodiment, the specialty chemicals are in the form of an aqueous solution or slurry that can be applied on wood chips during soaking or washing operations.
[0041] The foregoing may be better understood by reference to the following example, which is presented for purposes of illustration and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
[0042] Several methods presented below, were used to simulate the environment in which the invention can be practiced. Pulp samples were obtained from Midwestern American mills and from European mills (softwood TMP, TMP 1.sup.st and 2.sup.nd rejects). The doses are based on actives unless stated otherwise. DTPA has always been used in a form of a 38% solution (normally used in the industry) and the doses refer to this solution.
Test A. High Temperature Shock Conditions: Borohydride-Based Compositions with Sodium Hydroxide
[0043] Experimental tests were conducted under wet temperature shock conditions simulating those in a refiner where to mechanical treatment occurs. Samples of TMP were placed in stainless steel digesters and the chemicals added in water so that the end consistency was 3-5% dry pulp in slurry. The samples were kept at 150.degree. C. for 10 minutes in a rotating digester setup, cooled down, washed, pH measured and had handsheets made from them. The pH in all the samples went from alkaline to slightly acidic, indicating a finished chemical reaction; therefore no acidification of the slurries was needed.
