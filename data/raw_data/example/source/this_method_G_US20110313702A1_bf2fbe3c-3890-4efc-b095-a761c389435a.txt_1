[0119] As described above, when the polarity of the second derivative Q1 is positive, the spectral distribution curve is a downwardly convex curve. When the polarity of the second derivative Q1 is negative, the spectral distribution curve is a upwardly convex curve. Moreover, when the curvature of the spectral distribution curve increases (the spectral intensity changes abruptly), the absolute value of the second derivative Q1 increases. That is, the second derivative Q1 (positive or negative) serves as information on the shape of the spectral distribution curve (information on whether the curve is upwardly convex or downwardly convex) and information on the abruptness of the change in the spectral distribution (information on whether or not the change is abrupt or smooth).
[0120] Focusing on this property, in the present embodiment, the second derivative Q1 is used as the basic data for calculation of the correction value. That is, as described above, the correction value Cx for a correction target spectral band is calculated through an operation (specifically, multiplication of the second derivative Q1 by the correction coefficient k1) based on the calculated second derivative Q1 and the correction coefficient k1 (k1 is a real number). The correction value Cx has a property such that it has a polarity (positive/negative) corresponding to the upward/downward convex shape of the spectral distribution curve and the magnitude of the absolute value thereof increases in proportion to the abruptness of the change in the spectral distribution curve. Therefore, the correction value Cx which has an appropriate value corresponding to the shape of the spectral distribution curve and the abruptness thereof is obtained by a simple method.
[0121] If k1=1, the second derivative Q1 is used as the correction value as it is. Moreover, although the correction coefficient k1 is basically a positive real number excluding 0, k1 may exceptionally be set to 0 (for example, when no correction is executed). According to this method, the correction value of which the magnitude is variably controlled can be generated quickly (for example, real-time) by a simple method (simple configuration).
[0122] In the correction value superimposition section 529, the correction value Cx output from the multiplication section 527 is superimposed (added or subtracted) on the reception data (reception signal) read out by the readout circuit 523 (specifically, the correction value Cx is subtracted from the reception data (reception signal), for example). In this way, the integration error correction is executed, and the reception data (reception signal) Sm (m=1 to 16) having been subjected to integration error correction are obtained.
[0123] The signal processing section 600 includes a calculation section 602 for calculating a spectral reflectance curve or a spectral absorptance curve. The signal processing section 600 executes predetermined signal processing based on the corrected reception signal (corrected reception data) corrected by the correction operation section 500 to calculate a spectrophotometric distribution, for example. The signal processing section 600 outputs a signal (that is, spectrophotometric distribution information) Sout representing the calculated spectral intensities for each wavelength.
