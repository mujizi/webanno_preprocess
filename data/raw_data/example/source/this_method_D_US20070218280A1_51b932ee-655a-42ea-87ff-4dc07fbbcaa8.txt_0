[0015] The fiber endowed with heat-retaining properties according to conventional techniques, as described above, has a problem in that the required amount of additives with respect to the fiber is considerable. Therefore, the specific weight of the fiber is increased, clothing or the like that is manufactured from this fiber is made heavier, and uniform dispersion of additives in the melted spun yarn is made difficult.
[0016] There is also a problem in that the infrared absorbent that is used is preferably an organic dye, a black dye, or the like when an organic material or a dye is used. Therefore, degradation due to heat and humidity is dramatic and weather resistance is inferior. There is a further problem in that because a dark color is used for coloring in order to add these materials to a fiber, the inventions cannot be used in light-colored products, and the range of fields in which the inventions can be used is limited.
[0017] In addition to the methods described above, a method is also known in which aluminum, titanium, or another metal powder is anchored or deposited by vapor deposition or another method onto the fiber, whereby a radiation reflection effect is imparted and heat-retaining properties are improved. However, applications for this method are limited because there are problems in that the color of the fiber is changed by the anchoring or deposition process, costs are increased by vapor deposition, deposition defects occur due to small variations in the way the cloth is handled during preparatory steps to vapor deposition, the heat-retaining capacity is reduced due to fallout of vapor deposited metals caused by friction during washing or wearing, and various other problems occur.
[0018] The present invention was contrived in view of the background described above, and an object is to provide a fiber that has excellent transparency and weather resistance and that and contains a heat-absorbing component that absorbs heat with good efficiency, and to provide a textile product that uses the fiber, and does not compromise designability while having excellent heat-retaining properties.
