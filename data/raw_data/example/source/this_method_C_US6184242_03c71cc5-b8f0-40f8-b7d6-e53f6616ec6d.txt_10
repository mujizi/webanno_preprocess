In step 4, a compound 38 is prepared by reacting compound 37 with a sulfonylating agent such as a sulfonyl halide or an acylating agent such as an acyl halide. The reaction proceeds under an inert atmosphere in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine in a halogenated organic solvent such as dichloromethane or dichloroethane.
In step 5, an phenylamine compound of formula Ik is prepared by removing the P.sup.2 amino-protecting group from compound 38 by treatment with a with a base such as lithium hydroxide. Suitable solvents for the reaction include alcoholic or protic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, or water.
An exemplary preparation of a compound of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compound of formula Ik is described in detail in Example 19.
Scheme L
Scheme L describes an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 is a group represented by formula (C) where X is N, and R.sup.6 is --CONR.sup.8 R.sup.9 or --SO.sub.2 NR.sup.8 R.sup.9, from the corresponding intermediate compound of formula Il. ##STR20##
