Anti-lock brake control systems prevent or minimise wheel lock-up by sensing incipient lock-up and then releasing brake pressure until the wheel recovers in speed and then re-applying the brake pressure and repeating the cycle as often as necessary. It has been proposed to detect incipient wheel lock-up by producing an electrical wheel speed signal, feeding this to a linear differentiator capable of producing an acceleration/deceleration signal, and comparing the deceleration signal with a predetermined threshold deceleration in a comparator so as to detect any deceleration in excess of said threshold and produce a corresponding output pulse to control the release of brake pressure whilst said threshold is exceeded.
A problem with this proposed system is that the use of a differentiator with a fast response so as to allow rapid sensing of incipient wheel lock-up, makes the system susceptible to non-skid deceleration signals produced by rough road conditions. These spurious skid signals generally occur as short and frequent pulses that in turn cause short and frequent brake pressure release pulses so that braking pressure is seriously reduced.
The present invention reduces or overcomes this problem by arranging that the output pulse produced by the comparator triggers a brake pressure release pulse of a preset maximum duration, and that the production of a brake pressure release pulse is inhibited for a preset time following the last such pulse so that the pulses cannot be produced above a certain maximum repetition frequency irrespective of more frequent variations in the wheel deceleration signal.
The pulse/space ratio of the brake pressure release pulses of maximum duration at the maximum frequency is chosen so as to provide an acceptable overall braking pressure. The control action then leads to a check on the level of the applied braking rather than a loss of braking effort and represents the best braking compromise on rough roads where overbraking can easily occur.
In particular, the present invention consists in an anti-lock brake control system for vehicles with braked wheels comprising a wheel speed sensor for producing a signal proportional to wheel speed, a differentiator that receives the wheel speed signal from said sensor and produces a corresponding acceleration/deceleration signal, a comparator that receives said acceleration/deceleration and responds by producing an output pulse while said acceleration/deceleration signal exceeds a predetermined deceleration threshold, a pulse circuit that is triggered by said output pulse signal and produces a brake pressure release pulse of a predetermined maximum duration, and an inhibit timing circuit that inhibits re-triggering of the pulse circuit for a predetermined duration after said brake pressure release pulse has terminated.
