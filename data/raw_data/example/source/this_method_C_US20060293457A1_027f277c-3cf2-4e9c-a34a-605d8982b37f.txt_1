[0048] Platinum-containing catalysts which are useful with the silicon hydride compounds for improved cure in the process of the invention are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,578,497; U.S. Pat. No. 3,220,972; and U.S. Pat. No. 2,823,218, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. These catalysts include chloroplatinic acid, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate, complexes of chloroplatinic acid with sym-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane, dichloro-bis(triphenylphosphine)platinum (II), cis-dichloro-bis(acetonitrile)platinum (II), dicarbonyldichloroplatinum (II), platinum chloride and platinum oxide. Zero valent platinum metal complexes such as Karstedt's catalyst are particularly preferred, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,775,452; U.S. Pat. No. 3,814,730; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,288,345 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0049] Any phenolic curative which fully cures EPDM rubber is suitable in the practice of the invention. The use of conventional phenolic resin curatives for crosslinking EPDM in a thermoplastic elastomer is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,311,628, which is incorporated by reference for its teachings thereon. See also, the dibenzyl ether modified phenolic resins of U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,425, also incorporated by reference for its teachings. For further details of phenolic curative systems see "Vulcanization and Vulcanizing Agents," W. Hoffman, Palmerton Publishing Company. Suitable phenolic curing resins and brominated phenolic curing resins are commercially available under the trade names SP-1045, HRJ14247A, CRJ-352, SP-1055 and SP-1056 from Schenectady Chemicals, Inc. Similar functionally equivalent phenolic curing resins may be obtained from other suppliers. In one embodiment, the phenolic curative is added into the first feeding throat along with any coagent, polymer feed components, and optionally, with all, or a portion, of filler, processing oil and the like. In another embodiment, the coagents are added at the feed throat and the phenolic resin is added downstream from the feed throat but preferably not after 46% of the length of the multi-screw extruder.
[0050] The rubber may be partially of fully cured or crosslinked using such curatives. In one embodiment, the rubber is advantageously completely or fully cured. The degree of cure can be measured by determining the amount of rubber that is extractable from the thermoplastic vulcanizate by using cyclohexane or boiling xylene solvents as an extractant. This method is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,311,628, which is incorporated herein by reference for purpose of U.S. patent practice. Partially cured rubber will have as much as 50 wt. % extractable in solvent, and generally more than about 15 wt. % extractable. In preferred embodiments, the rubber has a degree of cure where not more than 15 weight percent, in other embodiments not more than 10 weight percent, in other embodiments not more than 5 weight percent, and in other embodiments not more than 3 weight percent is extractable by cyclohexane at 23.degree. C. as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,100,947 and 5,157,081, which are incorporated herein by reference for purpose of U.S. patent practice.
[0051] Often the engineering resin and vulcanizable elastomer or vulcanized elastomer alloys of the composition may be combined with a compatibilizer for these components. The compatibilizer provides interfacial adhesion between the vulcanized elastomer and the engineering resin. In conventional processing, without the compatibilizer, blends of engineering resin and vulcanized elastomer may often have poor mechanical elongation properties, the weak interfaces between the components may fail, and the components may delaminate. Compatibilizers include block copolymers having one block that is compatible with one component and at least one other block that is compatible with at least one other of the principal components. Other examples would include functionalized polymers having a backbone polymer that is compatible with one of the principal components and a graft moiety that is either compatible or reactive with at least one of the other principal components.
[0052] Compatibilizer forming materials may also be used. The compatibilizer can be formed by the direct interaction of segments containing the functional groups present in the major components, i.e. the engineering resin and the vulcanizable or vulcanized elastomer, or by interaction with another bi- or multi-functional compound. Such compatibilizers are known in the art, e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,455,545 and Journal of Macro Molecular Science Chemistry, A26(8), 1211 (1989). Where the engineering resin is a polyamide, the preferred compatibilizer includes the reaction product of nylon and functionalized polypropylene which is prepared by melt mixing nylon (6) with polypropylene grafted with 0.1-2.0 weight percent maleic anhydride in the ratio of nylon:maleated polypropylene ranging from 95:5 to 50:50. See Appl. Polym. Sci., 18, 963 (1974) and Eur. Polym. J., 26, 131 (1990). For example, a maleated olefin may be selected for its compatibility with an olefinic vulcanizable or vulcanized elastomer and reactivity with the polyamide engineering resin. Other compatibilizer forming materials such as an epoxy group grafted to a polypropylene molecule or an oxazoline group grafted to an olefin would also be appropriate to form a compatibilizer for a polyamide and olefinic vulcanizate blend. For purposes of this invention, a compatibilizer forming material is defined as a functionalized olefin or graft and/or block copolymer which acts to form a compatibilizer when grafted to an engineering resin.
