[1095] Modeling and Prediction of Microtubule Dynamics
[1096] As is well known to those familiar with their properties, microtubules are in a constant cycle of assembly and disassembly. The relative stability of an individual microtubule's length and the amount of time said microtubule remains assembled is determined by a multitude of cellular conditions which include but are not limited to: concentration of GTP and/or GDP, concentration of tubulin monomers, temperature, pH, concentrations of cytoplasmic salts, and other factors. Determination of the stability and or rate of growth and/or collapse of microtubules relative to time and predictions of these features allow for a powerful method to interrogate, among other things, cell health, position in the cell cycle, timing of cell division and control of cellular processes.
[1097] FIG. 31 is a flow diagram that describes a method 2900 for acquiring data about the disposition of a cell's microtubules, for applying these data to a mathematical algorithm, and for relating this processed information to cell health, position in the cell division cycle, or other experimentally determined disposition.
[1098] Steps 2910, 2912 and 2914 of FIG. 33 involve the determination of the length of microtubules. In one preferred embodiment, the microtubules involved in these steps are derived from a cell monolayer preferably grown in a laboratory incubator. As is known to those skilled in the art, the microtubules' length is often referred to as its "disposition "Referring again to FIG. 31, the microtubule disposition may either be determined by conventional optical density (using a spectrophotometer measuring absorbance of visible light at a wavelength of either 280 or 340 nanometers), as is described in step 2910. Alternatively, or additionally, the microtubule disposition may be determined by cryelectron microscopy, and/or by other conventional means. Reference may be had, e.g., to U.S. Pat. No. 4,857,735 (light emitting diode spectrophotometer), U.S. Pat. No. 5,184,193 (dual fiber optic spectrophotometer), U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,098 (path constrained spectrophotometer), U.S. Pat. No. 6,654,119 (scanning spectrophotometer for high throughput fluorescence detection), U.S. Pat. No. 6,813,024 (non-focusing optics spectrophotometer), and the like. The entire disclosure of each of these United States patents is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification.
[1099] Referring again to FIG. 31, in step 2916, data is accumulated regarding the disposition of the microtubles, preferably by a machine such as a computer (not shown)which is capable of accumulating information acquired from steps 2910, 2912 and/or 2914 in the form of a database or hardcopy, or other recording method.
