As a method for manufacturing a microlens array for use with such products as liquid crystal display panels, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application (kokai) 3-198003 teaches a method for manufacturing a microlens array by dripping resin onto a master having a plurality of curved surfaces corresponding to lenses, curing the resin to form a light transmitting layer, and then separating this light transmitting layer to produce the microlens array.
With these methods, however, it is necessary to separately manufacture and then combine the color filter and microlens array.
The present invention resolves this problem by providing a method for easily manufacturing an optical substrate whereby a bright color display can be achieved, an optical substrate manufactured by this method, and a display device that uses the optical substrate.
(1) A manufacturing method for an optical substrate according to the present invention comprises:
a step for forming a light transmitting layer by bonding a first master having a plurality of color protrusions with a second master having a plurality of curved surface parts with a light transmitting layer precursor disposed therebetween so as to form a light transmitting layer having a plurality of color recesses transferred from the color protrusions and a plurality of lenses transferred from the curved surface parts;
