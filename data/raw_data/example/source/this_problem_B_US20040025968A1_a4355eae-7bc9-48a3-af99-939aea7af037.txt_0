[0008] An increasing problem is the effect on air quality. The spilled fuel quickly evaporates, producing a volume of vapor several times larger than that of the spilled liquid fuel. The effect in a single case of spillage is small, but when multiplied by the large number of off-road gasoline-powered engines, some of which are refueled several times a day, the effects on air quality are significant.
[0009] Some states, notably California and Massachusetts, now require that portable gasoline containers sold in their states be un-vented, and equipped with an automatic shutoff spout which is spill-proof and able to capture fuel vapor as it is displaced from the fuel tanks of off-road, internal combustion engines by the incoming liquid fuel. It is predicted by some knowledgeable people in the industry that most states will follow with similar requirements within a few years.
[0010] Inventors have responded with various schemes to solve this problem. U.S. Pat. No. 6,318,604, to Messner et al depends upon a manual shut-off valve which fails to meet California's requirement of automatic shutoff. Spills can occur if the user does not release the valve when the tank is full and, as pointed out earlier, it is often difficult, under adverse lighting conditions, to observe the rapidly rising fuel level in the small openings found in most fuel tanks.
[0011] All of the prior art devices discovered rely upon developing a partial vacuum within the portable fuel container at some time during the re-fueling procedure. The resulting pressure differential, between atmospheric pressure and container pressure, is intended to support the head (weight) of the gasoline remaining in the container after the vent tube opening is blocked by rising fuel in the tank.
[0012] There are three serious limitations of partial container-vacuum systems, either or all, of which are characteristic of the prior art devices:
