[0001] The invention relates to a method for real-time determination of the mass of particles present in a particle filter for the combustion engine of a motor vehicle.
[0002] The invention also relates to the use of this method in a method for management of an engine, especially engines running on lean mixture.
[0003] As it happens, the heterogeneity of the combustion processes in engines running on lean mixture has the effect of generating carbon particles which cannot be burned efficiently by the engine. That is expressed by the production of black exhaust smoke, characteristic of this type of engine, especially during starting phases and during hard accelerations. Compliance with future legislative standards requires the use of depollution systems capable of completely eliminating the particles as well as the nitrogen oxides.
[0004] For this purpose there is now available a semi-porous element forming a particle filter in the exhaust line, which permits the gaseous components to pass but retains the particulate compounds. In diesel engines, the fumes make us the basic constituent of these particulate compounds.
