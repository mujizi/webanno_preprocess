[0057] As shown in FIG. 8, with turning control during EPS control, steering assist torque Ta is set by gain map or chart and steering torque Th input from steering wheel 6, and limiter processing is executed to set the motor control command value. Then, as shown in FIG. 9, based on the turning servo control derived from feed forward control+feed back control+robust compensation, the command current is obtained from the motor control command value, and turning motor 14 is driven.
[0058] As shown in the turning control block diagram of FIG. 8, turning control during recovery from EPS control to SBW control is performed by adding turning torque correction value .DELTA.T at first switch SW1 activation to ON at time of clutch OFF operation (period between release command and release completion). At this point, turning torque correction value .DELTA.T is calculated by combining steering angular velocity gain Gd.theta., axial force change gain GdF, and vehicle motion amount gain GdY with turning torque correction standard value .DELTA.T0. (See FIGS. 15 to 18.)
[0059] FIG. 10, "Switching Control Process", is a flowchart showing the switching control process executed by controllers 19,19 according to the illustrated embodiment, and the following is a description of each of its steps. Furthermore, this process is executed (switching control unit) at a predetermined control cycle, such as 10 msec.
[0060] At Step S1, the controller confirms the control condition of the steer-by-wire mechanism, and the process advances to Step S2.
[0061] At Step S2, following the condition confirmation of Step S1, the controller determines whether or not an irregularity is present in the steer-by-wire mechanism, and the process advances to Step S3 if the system is normal, or it advances to Step S5 upon system irregularity for the level capable of maintaining EPS control, at system check, at failure diagnosis, and at turning that approaches the maximum turning angle, etc., or it advances to Step S18 at system failure incapable of maintaining EPS control. Specifically, Step S2 confirms the SBW control condition and executes judgment for performing condition transition. That determination is the judgment serving to perform as a system check and the judgment executed at failure diagnosis. If normal, the system operates with SBW control after system start, and condition transition to EPS control will be required at execution of backup mechanism check. Aside from these situations, at system failure during SBW control, transition from SBW control to EPS control will be required as a redundant system for avoiding sudden system down from SBW control to manual steering (control suspended).
