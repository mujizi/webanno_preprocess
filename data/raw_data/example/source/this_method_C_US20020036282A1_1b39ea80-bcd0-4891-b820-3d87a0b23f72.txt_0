[0137] The relative t factors for MPB compositions in various solid solutions of the NBT-based system lie within a narrow range. As shown in FIG. 31, the MPB represents a field of two-phase coexistence, with the rhombohedral phase to its left and the tetragonal phase to its right. Arrows indicate the range of the MPB composition. Additions of a large B-cation relative to the A-cation stabilizes the rhombohedral phase (t decreases). Where the A-cation is made larger with respect to the B-cation, the tetragonal phase is stabilized (t increases).
[0138] Thus the method provides for identification of compositions near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between two phases of different crystal symmetry in doped perovskite systems, e.g., Na.sub.1/2Bi.sub.1/2TiO.sub.3 (NBT). The composition is determined using the relative tolerance factor, as defined herein, and self-consistent sets of ionic radii. The identity and concentrations of these dopants are selected so as to obtain a relative tolerance factor "t" that is within a specified range. The tolerance factor is dependent on the values of ionic radii used; tabulated values such as those by Shannon (Acta Cryst. A32:751 (1976)) are used here and calculated for a selected relative size and concentration of the dopants on the 12-fold coordinated "A"site and 6-fold coordinated "B"site of the perovskite structure.
[0139] According to one aspect of the invention, the following method is provided: choose new cation-dopants for a known base-system; calculate the values for t for a range of dopant fractions; and then compare the new t values to the characteristic MPB tolerance factors-range for the system. For example, in compositions containing predominantly NBT, 0.975<t<0.978 identifies the location of the MPB (FIG. 31). As a test of this method, NBT doped with Ba on the A-site and Zr on the B-site have been grown in single crystal form and as sintered polycrystalline samples. X-ray diffraction of a wide range of Ba+Zr codoped compositions has shown that the method successfully predicts the MPB. The MPB between two ferroelectric phases is known to often have superior electromechanical properties compared to those away from the MPB. Thus one aspect of the present invention is the ability to predict useful compositions using the relative tolerance factor approach.
[0140] The following table lists the cations that are likely to be useful as A-site and B-site dopants along with ionic radius (Shannon (1976)) and polarizability data (Shannon, J. Appl. Phys. 73:348 (1993)), where available.
