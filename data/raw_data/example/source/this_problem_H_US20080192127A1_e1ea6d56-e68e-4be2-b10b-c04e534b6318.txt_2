[0340]FIGS. 26A to 26C are diagrams for explaining an AD conversion processing procedure of the reference signal comparison type according to the second example of the fourth embodiment. In the first example, it is assumed that time necessary for switching of the switch 410 in the operation-current-switching control unit 400 of the readout-current control unit 24 and a comparison operation in the voltage comparing unit 252 is sufficiently short and is also sufficiently short compared with time (AD unit Tad) in which a potential of the reference signal Vslop changes 2 LSB. However, actually, in some case, the time is not short in this way.
[0341]For example, as shown in FIG. 26A, time equal to or longer than .beta. clocks and shorter than ".beta.+1" clocks of the count clock CKdac (.beta. is referred to as processing delay clock width) is further necessary until comparison processing at the pixel signal voltage Vx_2 is completed after comparison processing at the pixel signal voltage Vx_1. In this case, in the processing in the first example, the counter unit 254 stores a count value "T+.beta.". In processing for deciding pixel data, since the counter unit 254 outputs "2 (T+.beta.)-1" or 2 (T+.beta.) as a final count value, an error occurs. This is similar to the problem in the first example of the first embodiment.
[0342]To solve this problem, in the same manner as the measures taken in the second example of the first embodiment, it is sufficient to set, according to the processing delay clock width .beta., the pixel signal voltage Vx_2 "1+2.beta." LSB lower compared with the pixel signal voltage Vx_1 and perform an AD conversion operation in synchronization with a count operation in the counter unit 254 as described below.
[0343]Specifically, as in the first example, the voltage comparing unit 252 in each of the pixel rows compares, in the beginning of the comparison processing, the pixel signal voltage Vx_1 and the reference signal Vslop supplied from the vertical signal line 19 of the pixel row corresponding thereto. At a point when the pixel signal voltage Vx_1 (an analog value) and the reference signal Vslop coincide with each other, the voltage comparing unit 252 switches the comparison pulse COMP from the H level to the L level. The counter unit 254 stores a count value T at this point.
[0344]In the operation-current-switching control unit 400 of the readout-current control unit 24, the switch 410 in each of the pixel rows switches connection of a gate line to the load MOS transistor 242 from the gate line 243_1 corresponding to the operation current Id_1 to the gate line 243_2 corresponding to the operation current Id_2 when the comparison pulse COMP from the voltage comparing unit 252 in the column is switched to the L level.
