Prior to the advent of the present invention, the problems inherent in manual operation of aircraft bulk cargo doors and similar relatively large closure members adapted to pivot inwardly about a horizontal axis have resulted in various proposals for spring actuated counterbalance systems for storing the energy required to counterbalance the changing gravitational moment created as such a door is pivoted about its horizontal hinge axis between a first closed position wherein the door lies in a downwardly and inwardly inclined plane where hinge moments are of least consequence, and a second open position where the door lies in a generally horizontal plane, thus producing significant gravitational hinge moments attributable to the weight and size of the door which must be manually overcome by the cargo attendant during a door-opening operation and manually resisted by the attendant during a door-closing operation.
One of the most common and widespread "solutions" to this problem has involved the use of a counterbalance system employing: (i) a horizontal guide tube containing coaxial end-to-end compression springs for storing the energy required to counterbalance the door's gravitational hinge moment; (ii) a double differential pulley; (iii) a first cable coupled at one end to a spring actuator within the guide tube and having its opposite end coupled to one track or groove in the double differential pulley, such groove having a variable pitch radius; (iv) a second cable coupled at one end to the door and having its opposite end coupled to a second track or groove in the double differential pulley, and also having a variable pitch radius; and (iv), a plurality of idler pulleys about which respective ones of the first and second cables are trained. The ratio of the variable pitch radii in the double differential pulley and the magnitude of spring load are tailored to provide the desired counterbalance moment to effectively balance or minimize the gravitational hinge moment that must be overcome and/or resisted by the cargo attendant at each different position of the cargo door as it is shifted between its fully opened and fully closed positions. In terms of "solving" the gravitational hinge moment problem, per se, the foregoing counterbalance system has proven highly effective and is in use today on many large commercial aircraft.
Unfortunately, however, the foregoing counterbalance system is characterized by a number of inherent disadvantages. For example, such systems are relatively complex and, therefore, relatively expensive, requiring two cables, a differential pulley (which is normally oriented in a plane parallel to and closely adjacent the bulk cargo compartment overhead due to serious space constraints), a pair of cables, and multiple idler pulleys. More important, however, the cables are subject to wear at numerous localized regions as a result of cable flexure at those points where the cables are required to wrap about the idler pulleys and the double differential pulley; and, indeed, the system inherently requires that such localized regions of the cables flex several times during each door opening/closing cycle, thus resulting in severe wear and reduced cable life. Of even greater significance is the problem inherent in the double differential pulley arrangement which requires that the cables oscillate as they are "paid on" and "paid off" the variable pitch diameter grooves in the pulley where such oscillation results in misalignment of the cables and pulley grooves, jamming of the counterbalance system, continually changing degrees of wrap about idler pulleys, and resultant wear of the cables and pulleys. Moreover, the space constraints within which such counterbalance systems must operate have heretofore dictated that the idler pulleys and double differential pulley have relatively small diameters--indeed, the idler pulleys are generally only about 2.5 inches in diameter--a factor further contributing to cable wear and shortened cable life.
Yet, notwithstanding the foregoing disadvantages, all of which impose severe maintenance problems and expenses, the two-cable double differential pulley counterbalance system has, until the present invention, presented the most satisfactory approach to the problem and is in widespread use today.
