Example 263
2-isopropyl-7-methoxypyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-boric acid
[0809]The compound of Example 262 (1.60 g) was dissolved in THF (60 mL) in an argon atmosphere. While this solution was stirred at -78.degree. C., butyl lithium (2.5 mol/L hexane solution, 2.62 mL) was added. After 15 min, trimethylborate (1.7 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour and then at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, ethanol (5 mL) was added. The solvent was concentrated and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate:methanol=10:0.3) to afford the title compound as a colorless powder (899 mg).
