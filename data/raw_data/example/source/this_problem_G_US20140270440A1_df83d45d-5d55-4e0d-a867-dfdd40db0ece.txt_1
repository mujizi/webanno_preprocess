[0047] In the context of the present invention, the terms "digital sensor" and "digital detector" are considered to be equivalent. These describe the panel that obtains image data in a digital radiography system. The term "revolve" has its conventional meaning, to move in a curved path or orbit around a center point. The term "energy band" has its conventional meaning, as referring to a continuous segment of the x-ray energy spectrum.
[0048] In order to more fully understand aspects of the present invention, it is instructive to consider different approaches used for imaging in conventional practice and to compare these with aspects of imaging according to embodiments of the present invention. FIGS. 2A through 2D schematically illustrate different approaches to radiologic imaging. FIG. 2A shows elements of an x-ray imaging sensor 50 that uses an indirect imaging method for generating image data in response to radiation through a patient or other subject. In this model, x-ray photons are incident on an x-ray converting element 52 that converts the energy from ionizing x-ray radiation to visible light or other light energy. X-ray converting element 52 is commonly referred to as a scintillator. An energy detecting element 54, mounted on a support structure 56, then detects the converted energy, such as using an array of photocells. The photocells can be light-sensitive CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) components formed in an array as a semiconductor chip and providing a signal corresponding to each detected image pixel. Unconverted x-ray photons are trapped in an optical fiber plate.
[0049] Scatter, resulting in cross-talk between pixels and consequent loss of some amount of resolution, is one acknowledged problem with the basic approach shown in FIG. 2A. The modification of FIG. 2B addresses this problem and reduces the number of unconverted x-ray photons by adding a fiber-optic array 60 between the scintillator or x-ray converting element 52 and energy detecting elements 54. FIG. 2C shows another modification that can help to improve sensitivity to radiation, enlarging the width of the scintillator or x-ray converting element 52; however, this solution can result in some loss of sharpness in the obtained image.
[0050] FIG. 2D shows the use of a structured scintillator serving as x-ray converting element 52. The structured scintillator can use a material such as cesium iodide (CsI), although this material is structurally fragile, expensive and has some limitations with respect to image quality. Some believe that thicker layers of CsI attenuate light faster, such that they produce extra visible-light photons. This modified scintillator type can be used in addition to fiber-optic array 60 as shown in FIG. 2D for some improvement in performance.
[0051] The conventional model shown in FIG. 2A and improvements outlined with respect to FIGS. 2B, 2C, and 2D provide a reasonable level of imaging performance for dental imaging applications. However, even with the added cost and complexity of the additional components and features used, only incremental improvements in image quality and overall performance are achieved.
