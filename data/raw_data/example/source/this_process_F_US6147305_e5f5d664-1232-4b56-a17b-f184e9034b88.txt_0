At this time, in two brackets 24 at the installation platform plate 20 side, the insulating spacer 30 in assembled state with the pair of right and left housing brackets 11 abuts against the spacer holding portion 24b. Accordingly, the housing 10 may be temporarily positioned on the installation platform plate 20 almost instantly. By the temporary positioning, the cylindrical collar member 40 in the insulating spacer 30 and the screw hole 24c in the bracket 24 of the installation platform plate 20 coincide with each other coaxially.
In succession, the mounting bolt 50 is inserted into the cylindrical collar member 40, and is driven into the screw hole 24c of the installation platform bracket 24 at the opposite side. Now, each housing bracket 11 at the housing 10 side, and each installation platform bracket 24 at the installation platform plate 20 side are coupled together with the insulating spacer 30.
In this process, the worker does not have to support and hold the housing 10, from the step of inserting the mounting bolts 50 into all cylindrical collar members 40 until the step of driving into the installation platform bracket 24. The housing 10 is positioned almost completely when put on the installation platform plate 20, and is not deviated, and the worker does not have to mind falling of the housing 10, so that the housing 10 may be tightened fully by the mounting bolts 50 safely.
FIG. 7 is a perspective view showing a second embodiment of the invention. Same reference numerals are given to the common or similar members in the first embodiment as shown in FIGS. 2-6, and their repeated explanation is omitted.
In this case, instead of the cylindrical collar member 40 preliminarily fitted and set in the insulating spacer 30, a metal-made cylindrical collar member 60 is used. In the case of the cylindrical collar member 60, the mounting bolt 50 has screw threads 51 partially formed. Only a half cut section is shown in FIG. 6, and female threads 61 for engaging with the male threads 51 of the mounting bolt 50 are formed in the cylindrical inner circumference. In the cylindrical outer circumference, same as in the first embodiment, an annular groove 62 is formed to be engaged with a protrusion 42 provided in a bolt through hole 32 of an insulating spacer 30. Therefore, by driving the mounting bolt 50 into the female threads 61, the mounting bolt 50 is prevented from slipping out of the insulating spacer 30 during and after mounting work, and an anti-slipping function is obtained.
