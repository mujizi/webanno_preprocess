[0034] The cycle of evaporative crystallization at higher temperature, preferably from 75 to 85.degree. C., to remove sodium sulfate, and the first cooling crystallization at lower temperature, preferably at 33-35.degree. C., can be continued until the solid content of impurities, mainly sodium ditaurinate and sodium tritaurinate, accumulates to about 30% of the solid content in the mother liquor.
[0035] The mother liquor from the first cooling crystallization stage can be returned to the ammonolysis step. Preferably, the mother liquor is cooled to 10 to 15.degree. C. in the 2.sup.nd cooling crystallizer to co-crystallize taurine and sodium sulfate decahydrate, i.e., Glauber's salt. The co-crystalline mixture is removed from the mother liquor by centrifuge and returned to a dissolution and preheat unit for the evaporative crystallization step. It becomes apparent from FIG. 2 that lower temperature may be used, but excessive cooling is required to be economical. At higher temperature, removal of sodium sulfate is not complete.
[0036] The mother liquor from the second cooling crystallization stage is usually comprised of 25-30% of sodium ditaurinate and tritaurinate, 5-7% of taurine, and 7-8% of sodium sulfate. Sodium hydroxide is then added in an amount sufficient to turn taurine to sodium taurinate, sodium ditaurinate to disodium ditaurinate, and disodium tritaurinate to trisodium tritaurinate. In other words, the molar amount of sodium hydroxide is equal to, or slightly more than, the molar amount of total taurinates in the solution. This solution is then saturated with ammonia to 15 to 28% and returned to the ammonolysis step. Optionally, this solution may be combined with a new batch of sodium isethionate or sodium vinyl sulfonate for the ammonolysis step.
[0037] Some of the mother liquor from the 2.sup.nd cooling crystallization needs to be purged from the cycle, when uncharacterized impurities start to adversely influence the quality of the product. The amount of purge solution in each cycle depends on the quality of starting materials, in particular, sodium isethionate and sodium vinyl sulfonate. If crude sodium isethionate in the ethylene oxide process is used, purge is required in about every five to eight cycles, because ethylene glycol, a byproduct from the reaction of ethylene oxide with water, starts to accumulate. If sodium isethionate is prepared from ethanol and ethylene, no purge is necessary at all.
[0038] Crude taurine obtained in the cyclic process is recrystallized from deionized water one or more times to yield a product of pharmaceutical grade. The recrystallization mother liquor may be reused several times until it affects the quality of the product obtained. This mother liquor, consisting of residual taurine, sodium sulfate, and impurities, is then sent to dissolution and preheat unit for the evaporative crystallization.
