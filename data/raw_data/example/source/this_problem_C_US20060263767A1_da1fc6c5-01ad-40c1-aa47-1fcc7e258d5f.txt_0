Ultrasensitive Detection of Prions by saPMCA
[0161] Sensitivity of detection after automated PMCA was analyzed by comparing the signal intensity in Western blots before and after amplification. It was determined that 140 PMCA cycles enabled detection of PrP.sup.Sc in as little as a 6.6 million-fold dilution of 263K scrapie brain. An equivalent quantity of PrP.sup.Sc was detected without PMCA in a 1,000-fold dilution of the same material, indicating that the increase of sensitivity under these conditions was approximately 6,600-fold.
[0162] During these studies, it was noted that the efficiency of amplification started to decrease after around 150 cycles (75 h of incubation). The inventors discovered that the reason for this problem is the inactivation of the material by continuous incubation at 37.degree. C. It is likely that incubation may have a negative effect on the stability of PrP.sup.C substrate or other brain cofactors essential to catalyze the conversion. This conclusion was based on an experiment in which the amplification efficiency was dramatically reduced when the 10% normal brain homogenate was pre-incubated (with our without sonication) during 72 h prior to the beginning of PMCA amplifications. This result was motivation to develop a new technology called serial automated PMCA (saPMCA) in order to further increase sensitivity of detection. This technology consists of performing a series of up to 144 PMCA cycles each. After the end of a first round of 144 PMCA cycles, samples are diluted 10-fold into fresh 10% normal brain homogenate and another 144 (or less) PMCA cycles is performed. saPMCA resolves the problem of exhaustion of the substrate and enables to maintain the exponential conversion of PrP. Two successive rounds of PMCA cycling separated by a 10-fold dilution of the amplified samples into fresh 10% normal brain homogenate, led to a dramatic increase in sensitivity. The experiment consisted of performing a first round of 96 PMCA cycles in which PrP.sup.Sc signal was detected up to the 3.1.times.10.sup.6-fold dilution of scrapie brain. Thereafter, this and all the successive dilutions in which no PrP.sup.Sc signal was detected were diluted 10-fold into normal brain homogenate and subjected to a new round of 118 PMCA cycles. This second round of PMCA enabled detection of PrP.sup.Sc up to the 5.times.10.sup.10-fold dilution of scrapie-infected hamster brain. By comparing the signal intensity of PrP.sup.Sc with or without PMCA, the increase of sensitivity was around 10-million fold. This sensitivity can be further increased by performing more rounds of saPMCA.
