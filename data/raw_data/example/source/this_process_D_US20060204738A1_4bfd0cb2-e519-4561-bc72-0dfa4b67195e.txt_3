Synthesis of a Hollow Nanotube for Drug Delivery
[0406] Silicon nanowires are synthesized using the VLS technique. Oriented or unoriented nanowires may be synthesized depending on conditions. The outer shell of the wires may be converted to silicon oxide by high temperature thermal processing. Alternatively, silicon oxide may be deposited on the wires at low temperatures using PECVD. The core silicon can then be etched away in the gas phase using, for example XeF.sub.2. Tubes of different compositions may be made using this process as a mold.
