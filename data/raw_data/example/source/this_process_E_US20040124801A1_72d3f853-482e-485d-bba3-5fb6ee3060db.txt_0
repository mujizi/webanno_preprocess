[0088] Temp(diff)=the current temperature less the previous temperature; and
[0089] K=a constant that corresponds to the temperature sensor 232 itself (such as when the sensor comprises a thermistor).
[0090] This equation will tend to produce a higher value as the ambient temperature drops quickly by a significant amount. Referring now to FIG. 25, in an alternative approach using temperature compensation, the operator first determines 251 whether the current temperature is less than a predetermined amount X (such as, in a preferred embodiment, zero degrees Celsius). If not, temperature differences often lend considerably less impact upon force and/or force sensing and hence normal 252 processing sans temperature compensation as described earlier will proceed. When the current temperature falls below the desired threshold, however, the operator measures 253 force. For purposes of this particular activity, the force need only be measured subsequent to the initial time period during which the characteristic transient peak ordinarily occurs. The operator then determines 254 whether the current measured force exceeds the current characteristic force value TH.sub.c as combined with a current temperature compensation value (wherein the current temperature compensation value can be calculated or otherwise obtained as described above). When true, the process continues in normal fashion (wherein the characteristic force value TH.sub.c is combined with the temperature compensation value and the excess force threshold value is determined accordingly). When the current peak force is less than the characteristic force value TH.sub.c as combined with the temperature compensation value, however, this process then sets 255 the characteristic force value TH.sub.c to equal the current force peak. So configured, the process will permit ordinary temperature compensation when significant differences are not present but will prompt rapid significant alteration when significant force differences are present under these conditions.
[0091] With reference to FIG. 26, yet another temperature compensation approach has the operator again measure 261 the current temperature and determine 262 whether it is cold enough to warrant temperature compensation. If not cold enough, the temperature compensation process can simply conclude 263. When it is cold enough, however, the operator then determines 264 a temperature differential TEMP(delta) by determining a difference between a previous temperature TEMP(ref) (as ordinarily corresponds to a previously utilized force measurement) and the current temperature. The operator then determines 265 whether this difference exceeds a predetermined amount Y (such as, in a preferred approach, 2.5 degrees Celsius). If not, then ordinary temperature compensation via use of a temperature compensation adder value can continue as described above. When the difference exceeds this predetermined amount, the operator facilitates rapid force-setting compensation by adopting 266 the current force peak as the updated characteristic force value TH.sub.c (while also establishing the current temperature as the reference temperature for use in a subsequent iteration of this same process). So configured, ordinary incremental temperature compensation can be utilized at colder temperatures with an immediate significant alteration to the characteristic force value when a significant shift in temperature during a colder interval occurs. In a preferred embodiment, such an immediate significant alteration will comprise the only force-setting alteration made during this corresponding cycle.
[0092] As mentioned earlier, runtime for the motor 11 can also impact accurate assessment of force, and particularly so during colder temperatures. Pursuant to yet another embodiment the operator can compensate for such phenomena. With reference to FIG. 27, the operator can optionally determine 271 whether the current temperature is less than a predetermined threshold X (in a preferred embodiment, X equals zero degrees Celsius). With warmer temperatures, the operator can typically dispense with any need for running motor compensation and simply proceed with normal 272 automatic force-setting procedures as related herein. At colder temperatures, however, the operator then determines 273 whether the motor 11 has had a predetermined operational state for more than a predetermined period of time Y. In a preferred approach, the operator determines 274 whether the motor 11 has been off for more than the time Y (Y can be selected as appropriate to a given application and generally should be no less than a period of time, such as thirty to sixty minutes, during which a motor will reach a quiescent state with respect to these phenomena).
