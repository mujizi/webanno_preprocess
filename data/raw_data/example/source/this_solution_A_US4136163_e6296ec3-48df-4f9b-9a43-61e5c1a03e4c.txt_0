EXAMPLE 25
Water soluble Adhesive
A solution was made up containing 5% gum acacia in water. To this solution was added 0.025% of N-ethyl-p-menthane-3-carboxamide. The solution was then coated on a label and allowed to dry. Licking the label to regain the tack prior to affixing the label to a substrate gave a pleasant cooling sensation on the tongue.
The above Examples illustrate the range of compounds and the range of compositions included within the present invention. However, they are not to be taken as limiting the scope of the invention in any way. Numerous other compounds within the general formula will be equally suitable for use in the compositions of Examples 1 - 25 and the physiological cooling effect obtained with the compounds of the invention will recommend their use in a wide variety of other compositions where the cooling effect will be of value.
