[0307] The undercut span, solvent flow, duration, and distance can be adjusted such that, when the conduits may be retracted or perforated to a new location within the unlined borehole portions, the solute will reach full saturation in the pregnant solution before the solvent approaches the ore region in proximity of the roof rock and/or oil shale, where it is then desirable to stop dissolution. Chloride contamination of the so formed liquor is thereby prevented, if desired.
[0308] A production of 1 million metric ton per year of soda ash from such trona bed of 0.25 square mile would require the injection of a total flow rate of roughly 500 cubic meters per hour (m.sup.3/h) of solvent and the extraction of roughly 600 m.sup.3/h of trona-loaded solution. That is to say, that with a pattern of 24 injection points and unlined parallel boreholes, the solvent flow rate per injection point will be from about 20 to about 25 m.sup.3/h. If the diameter of the unlined boreholes is 4 inches, the initial velocity of solvent would be 0.7 m/s. When all expanded boreholes connect laterally, the flow rate would become 0.75 m.sup.3/h m for each `linear meter` in width of the progression of the liquid downwards in the bed. When a layer of 0.25 meter of trona is being dissolved, about 2 centimeters (cm) of insoluble may be left over (with an assay of 92%), possibly creating an insoluble layer of 3 cm in thickness and 33% porosity, hence creating a tortuous flow channel for the liquid of 1 cm high. The speed for the liquid would then be about 2 cm/s. If the hydraulic diameters of these channels in which the liquid flows through such insoluble layer is 2 mm, a slope of 0.4% of the floor would be sufficient to enable a free flowing liquid to move through that zone by gravity.
[0309] If the liquor contamination occurring via dissolution of roof rock minerals is not a serious issue (in instances where the roof rock minerals do not contain contaminating solutes such as chloride), the operation of the in situ mining system can be carried out more aggressively in terms of the conduit travel distances or the extent of conduit body perforations and solvent flow rates. This process would continue until the entire 1/4 mile square trona bed is extracted.
[0310] Depending upon the capability of the drilling and pumping equipment used, it is expected that this system and method of the present invention can be employed to extract several square miles of trona in one continuous operation over several years.
[0311] Accordingly, the scope of protection is not limited by the description and the Example set out above, but is only limited by the claims which follow, that scope including all equivalents of the subject matter of the claims. Each and every claim is incorporated into the specification as an embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the claims are a further description and are an addition to the preferred embodiments of the present invention.
