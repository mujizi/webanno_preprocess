Example 207
4-(7-methoxy-2-trifluoromethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)oxobutyric acid
[0613]The compound of Example 163 (636 mg, crude product) was dissolved in dichloromethane (10.0 mL). To this solution, trifluoroacetic acid (5.00 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 7 hours. Subsequently, the solvent was evaporated and the residue was diluted with water. A 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was added to the mixture to make it basic and the mixture was extracted with diethyl ether. The resulting aqueous layer was made acidic by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid and the layer was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent afforded the title compound as a brown oil (616 mg, crude). This product was used in the subsequent reaction without further purification.
