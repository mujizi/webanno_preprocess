Application of Triclosan By Impregnation
In accordance with the only application method described within Swiss Patent 459,656, a textile was impregnated with triclosan and analyzed for its long-lasting antimicrobial properties.
Ultrafresh.RTM. NM, a 3% active triclosan dispersion available from Thomson Research Associates, Toronto, Canada, was diluted with water to 0.15% active triclosan content. The same fabric utilized on EXAMPLE 2 above was saturated with this solution and squeezed to about a 100% solution pick-up. The fabric was then immediately dried at 320.degree. F. for 3 minutes in a convection oven. The treated fabric showed a 7 mm zone of inhibition and 100% contact inhibition when tested against Staphylococcus aureus using AATCC Test Method 147-1993. After 5 regular washing and drying laundry cycles, however, the fabric showed no zone of inhibition and 0% contact inhibition.
