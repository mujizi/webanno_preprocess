[0086] Said porous plastic sheet may be a film made of, for example, polyolefine group resin such as polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, ethylene-ethylacrylate copolymer and the like (including modified polyolefine group resin), polyvinylchloride, polyurethane, polyester, polyester copolymer, polyamide, polyamide copolymer, and the like, or a mixture of two or more kinds of said resins.
[0087] Said laminated sheet is manufactured by such as extrusion molding a thermoplastic resin film using a T-die, and laminating said thermoplastic resin film on a fire resistant fiber sheet, further laminating other fiber sheet on said fiber sheet, then hot-pressing said laminated sheet into a prescribed shape.
[0088] Said thermoplastic resin film may be porous, or may be needled after laminating with said fire resistant fiber sheet to be a porous thermoplastic resin film, but when said thermoplastic resin film which has been extruded from the T-die, and softened by heating, is laminated on said fiber sheet, and pressed, said thermoplastic resin film may become porous, having a lot of fine holes. Said holes in said thermoplastic resin film may be formed by the shag on the surface of said fiber sheet. In this method, no process is necessary to form holes in said film, and fine holes may give the product an improved sound absorption property.
[0089] The ventilation resistance of said molded laminated sheet manufactured by the molding of said laminated sheet is preferably in the range of between 0.1 and 100 kPas/m. Said molded laminated sheet has an excellent sound absorption property.
[0090] EXAMPLES of the present invention are described below. However, the scope of the present invention should not be limited by only said EXAMPLES.
