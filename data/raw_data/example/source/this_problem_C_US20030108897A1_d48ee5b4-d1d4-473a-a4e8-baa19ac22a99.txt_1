[0198] In order to show the utility of this method, three probes 8 nucleotides in length were tested on a collection of 51 plasmid DNA dots made from a library in Bluescript vector. One probe was present and specific for Bluescript vector but was absent in M13, while the other two probes had targets that were inserts of known sequence. This system allowed the use of hybridization negative or positive control DNAs with each probe. This probe sequence (CTCCCTTT) also had a complementary target in the interferon insert. Since the M13 dot is negative while the interferon insert in either M13 or Bluescript was positive, the hybridization is sequence specific. Similarly, probes that detect the target sequence in only one of 51 inserts, or in none of the examined inserts along with controls that confirm that hybridization would have occurred if the appropriate targets were present in the clones.
[0199] Thermal stability curves for very short oligonucleotide hybrids that are 6-8 nucleotides in length are at least 15.degree. C. lower than for hybrids 11-12 nucleotides in length [FIG. 1 and Wallace et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 6:3543-3557 (1979)]. However, performing the hybridization reaction at a low temperature and with a very practical 0.4-40 nM concentration of oligonucleotide probe allows the detection of complementary sequence in a known or unknown nucleic acid target. To determine an unknown nucleic acid sequence completely, an entire set containing 65,535 8-mer probes may be used. Sufficient amounts of nucleic acid for this purpose are present in convenient biological samples such as a few microliters of M13 culture, a plasmid prep from 10 ml of bacterial culture or a single colony of bacteria, or less than 1 ml of a standard PCR reaction.
[0200] Short oligonucleotides 6-10 nucleotides long give excellent discrimination. The relative decrease in hybrid stability with a single end mismatch is greater than for longer probes. Results with the octamer TGCTCATG support this conclusion. In the experiments, the target with a G/T end mismatch, hybridization to the target of this type of mismatch is the most stable of all other types of oligonucleotide. This discrimination achieved is the same as or greater than an internal G/T mismatch in a 19 base paired duplex greater than an internal G/T mismatch in a 19 paired duplex [Ikuta et al., Nucl. Acids res. 15:797 (1987)]. Exploiting these discrimination properties using the described hybridization conditions for short oligonucleotide hybridization allows a very precise determination of oligonucleotide targets. In contrast to the ease of detecting discrimination between perfect and imperfect hybrids, a problem that may exist with using very short oligonucleotides is the preparation of sufficient amounts of hybrids. In practice, the need to discriminate H.sub.p and H.sub.i is aided by increasing the amount of DNA in the dot and/or the probe concentration, or by decreasing the hybridization temperature. However, higher probe concentrations usually increase background. Moreover, there are limits to the amounts of target nucleic acid that are practical to use. This problems was solved by the higher concentration of the detergent Sarcosyl which gave an effective background with 4 nM of probe. Further improvements may be effected either in the use of competitors for unspecific binding of probe to filter, or by changing the hybridization support material. Moreover, for probes having E.sub.a less than 45 Kcal/mol (e.g. for many heptamers and a majority of hexamers, modified oligonucleotides give a more stable hybrid [Asseline, et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. 81:3297 (1984)] than their unmodified counterparts. The hybridization conditions described in this invention for short oligonucleotide hybridization using low temperatures give better discriminating for all sequences and duplex hybrid inputs. The only price paid in achieving uniformity in hybridization conditions for different sequences is an increase in washing time from minutes to up to 24 hours depending on the sequence. Moreover, the washing time can be further reduced by decreasing the salt concentration.
[0201] Although there is excellent discrimination of one matched hybrid over a mismatched hybrids, in short oligonucleotide hybridization, signals from mismatched hybrids exist, with the majority of the mismatch hybrids resulting from end mismatch. This may limit insert sizes that may be effectively examined by a probe of a certain length.
[0202] The influence of sequence complexity on discrimination cannot be ignored. However, the complexity effects are more significant when defining sequence information by short oligonucleotide hybridization for specific, nonrandom sequences, and can be overcome by using an appropriate probe to target length ratio. The length ratio is chosen to make unlikely, on statistical grounds, the occurrence of specific sequences which have a number of end-mismatches which would be able to eliminate or falsely invert discrimination. Results suggest the use of oligonucleotides 6, 7, and 8 nucleotides in length on target nucleic acid inserts shorter than 0.6, 2.5, and 10 kb, respectively.
