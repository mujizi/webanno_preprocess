Example 113
2-trifluoromethyl-4-formyl-7-iodo-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0387]The compound of Example 112 (3.26 g) was dissolved in dichloromethane (50.0 mL). To this solution, activated manganese dioxide (8.29 g) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 14 hours. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and the filtrate was evaporated. Purification of the resulting residue by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=4:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (2.97 g).
