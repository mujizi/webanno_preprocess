[0185] In case of a full-duplex UE, the UE may simultaneously perform UL transmission and DL reception. Thus, a subframe conflict does not occur. In a case in which at least even one DL subframe is configured in a plurality of serving cells, the corresponding subframe is defined as a PDCCH subframe. The UE performs PDCCH monitoring in every PDCCH subframe. However, conditions for counting the DRX retransmission timer should be re-defined in relation to an HARQ retransmission operation, and a timer value should not be unconditionally increased for a PDCCH subframe.
[0186] A) In Case of Cross-Carrier Scheduling
[0187] FIG. 12 is a view illustrating an operation of performing counting of a DRX retransmission timer by a UE according to another embodiment of the present invention. In this method, a subframe in which a PDCCH is not received in a scheduling cell is excluded in counting the DRX retransmission timer.
[0188] Referring to FIG. 12, a primary serving cell Pcell and a secondary serving cell SCell are configured in a UE. The TDD UL/DL configuration #0 (conf 0) is allocated to the primary serving cell, and the TDD UL/DL configuration #5 (conf 5) is allocated to the secondary serving cell. It is assumed that a period of a DRX cycle is 8 ms and a third expiration value is regarding the DRX retransmission timer is set to psf5. PDCCH subframes are subframes #0, #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, and #9 and subframes #0, #1, #3, #4, and #5 in a subsequent radio frame.
[0189] The primary serving cell is a scheduling cell with respect to the secondary serving cell, and the UE receives a PDCCH for the secondary serving cell on the primary serving cell of the subframe #0. The UE checks whether the PDCCH received through the primary serving cell indicates the presence of DL data transmission. The UE checks whether there is a carrier indicator field (CIF) in the PDCCH. When the CIF exists, the UE ascertains that the PDCCH serves for the secondary serving cell on the basis of the CIF. Thereafter, the UE starts the HART RTT timer related to a specific HARQ process according to HARQ entity information in the PDCCH.
