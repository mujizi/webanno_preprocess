[1053] U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,696, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification, discloses a metallized microtubule in its claim 1, describing "1.A composition for effecting the controlled release of an active agent to an environment, comprising a tubule containing a solution, dispersion, or blend of an active agent in a carrier in the lumen thereof, wherein said tubule has an inner diameter of from 0.1 to 1 .mu.m, a wall thickness of from 5 to 50 nm, an optional 200-2,000 nm thick metal coating on said wall, and a length of 1 .mu.m to 1 mm, wherein said active agent is tetracycline and said carrier is a water-soluble epoxy resin, said composition providing a zero order or first order release rate of said active agent from said tubule for a period of at least 30 days." At column 4 of this patent, it is disclosed that "The preparation of tubules is also discussed in an article by Schnur et al., "Lipid-based Tubule Microstructures", Thin Solid. Films, 152, pp. 181-206, (1987) and the articles cited therein. That same article, in which one of the inventors is a co-author, also describes metal coating tubules and using them as microvials to entrap, transport and deliver polymeric reagents to a desired site." In Example 1 of this patent, it is disclosed that" Unpolymerized tubules were produced from a mixed solvent system of 70% ethanol and 30% water by volume, with a lipid concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. The microtubules are formed at 27.degree. C. and following formation are dialyzed against water at pH 1.0 in 0.1N HCL. A commercial palladium and tin catalyst (Shipley Co., Waterbury, Mass.) is used as received. Cuposit (Shipley Co., Waterbury, Mass.) a commercial electroless copper plating bath is used per the manufacturers instructions to copper plate the accelerated microtubules. Following the plating reaction the excess bath is removed and the tubules are filtered to remove excess water. A commercial freeze drying apparatus is used to dry the metallized microtubules to a powder. The desired active agent at saturation in the selected carrier is added slowly to the dry microstructures during which time the material is captured by the microstructures by capillary attraction. Exogenous material is removed by suspending the tubules in an excess of solvent and is followed by rapid filtration. These microstructures can again be dried or suspended in a diluent liquid." It should be noted that a similar disclosure also appears in U.S. Pat. No. 6,280,759, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification.
[1054] Metallized microtubules are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,787, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. As is disclosed at columns 4-5 of such patent, "Metallized microtubules, which are hollow tubule-shaped microstructures, are presently the preferred implementation within this category. The fabrication of these structures is described in Yager et al., "Formation of Tubules by a Polymerizable Surfactant", Molecular Crystals Liquid Crystals, vol. 106, 1984, pages 371-381, while a process for the deposition of thin metal coatings onto the microtubules is described in Schnur et al., "Lipid-based Tubule Microstructures", Thin Solid Films, vol. 152, 1987, pages 181-206. Microtubules with metal coatings such as nickel or permalloy can be aligned with either an electric or a magnetic field during the formation of the anisotropic solid polymer composite."
[1055] Metallized microtubules are also discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,452,564, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. As is disclosed at columns 4-5 of this patent, "In a preferred embodiment, the microtubules are formed from diacetylenic lipid (1,2 bis(tricosa-10,12-diynoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoch- oline), or DC8,9PC. See, for example, A. N. Lagarkov and A. K. Sarychev, Phys. Rev. B 53, 6318 (1996) and F. Behroozi, M. Orman, R. Reese, W. Stockton, J. Calvert, F. Rachfold and P. Schoen, J. Appl. Phys. 68, 3688 (1990). The lipid is dissolved in alcohol at 50.degree. C., water is added, and the temperature lowered to room temperature. The lipid self-assembles itself into microtubules and subsequently precipitates. The particles are rinsed and coated with a palladium catalyst and mixed with metal ions and reductants. In contact with the catalyst, the metal ions-are reduced to neutral metal on the surface of the microtubules and coat the structure with a conductive layer of metal of several tenths of a micron thickness. Several metal species are available for use in this process, but nickel and copper appear to be of greatest potential usefulness for the present invention. Once the microtubules have been metallized, they can be dried and subsequently mixed into a polymer matrix. The choice of polymer is dependent upon the properties desired for the resulting composite. Among the desirable properties are flexibility, strength, both chemical and environmental stability, and appropriate viscosity to properly disperse the metal powder."
[1056] Referring again to the process disclosed in the Kirsch et al. article, and at page 248 thereof, it is further disclosed that "Markowitz et al. [6] found that the diameters of metallized lipid tubules opened on the duration of dialysis conducted prior to metallization. The observed a distribution of diamters ranging from 100 up to 900 nm." The Reference [6] cited in the Kirsch et al. article was published in Thin Solid Films 224 (1993) 242.
[1057] The metllization of proteinaceous filaments was then discussed in the Kircsch et al. article. At page 248 thereof, it was disclosed that "Metallization of proteinaceous tubules was first demonstrated by Pazirendeh et al. [7] using rhapidosomes as the templates. Rhapidosomes are found in certain bacteria. They have a well defined diameter of 25 nm, considerably less than those of phospholipids tubules, and an average length of about 400 nanometers." The reference [7] cited by Kirsch et al. was published in Biomimetics 1 (1992) 41.
