[0046] The recirculation pump can be turned on before the drain pump is turned off. This provides an overlap of the operating times of the drain pump and the recirculation pump.
[0047] According to a further aspect of the invention the above and other objects are fulfilled by a method of operating a self cleaning filter system in a washing machine having a wash tub, a filter having an intake port, a drain port and a recirculation port, a recirculation path including a recirculation pump connected to the recirculation port and a recirculation pipe delivering recirculated water to the top of the tub, characterized in that the method includes the steps of: operating the recirculation pump for a first time period, and turning the recirculation pump off to permit at least part of the liquid in the recirculation path to flow transversely into the filter element to dislodge matter caught by the filter.
[0048] The recirculation pump is turned off only for a short time before being turned on again. This has the effect of returning the dislodged matter to the outer bowl by the bowl outlet, but little, if any, is returned to the inner wash bowl. This operation can be repeated several times during a wash cycle without any water exiting the machine via the drain pipe. Thus this method improves the wash operation, and also conserves water.
[0049] According to a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a filter element having a tubular body (14.120) having a first end and a second end, characterized in that it includes a first peripheral seal (14.104) around the first end and a second peripheral seal (14.106) around the second end.
[0050] The tubular body is self-supporting and adapted to withstand fluid pressure.
