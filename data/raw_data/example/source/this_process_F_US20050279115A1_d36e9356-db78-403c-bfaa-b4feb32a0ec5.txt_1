[0008] As shown in FIG. 9A, in the conventional direct-contact cooling tower, a ventilating fan 5 is installed in an upper portion of a main body 2 and an evaporative cooling section 3 is installed in a middle portion of the main body 2. Furthermore, a sprinkler 4 for spraying a cooling fluid is installed in an upper part of the evaporative cooling section 3. Also, a collection sump 7 is placed under the main body 2 and a supplementary water pipe 8 for compensating for the evaporation loss of the cooling fluid is installed in the collection sump 7.
[0009] In the cooling tower constituted as described above, if the sprinkler 4 sprays a cooling fluid as the atmospheric air passes through the evaporative cooling section 3, the cooling fluid is evaporatively cooled as it passes through the evaporative cooling section 3.
[0010] The cooling fluid, which has been evaporatively cooled by the above process, circulates in the apparatus to be cooled. This process is repeated.
[0011] According to the conventional cooling tower of the prior art, atmospheric air introduced into an inlet 6 passes through the evaporative cooling section 3 and moves toward the ventilating fan 5. During this process, contact of the induced air with a cooling fluid injected by the sprinkler 4 causes the evaporation of the cooling fluid, so that the cooling fluid can be evaporatively cooled.
[0012] The corresponding changes in the temperature of the air and the cooling fluid are depicted in FIG. 9B. As shown in FIG. 9B, the inflow air induced from the atmosphere is introduced into the evaporative cooling section with the wet-bulb temperature Twbi1, evaporatively cools the cooling fluid and then is discharged with the outlet wet-bulb temperature Twbo increased higher than the inlet wet-bulb temperature Twbi1. Thereby, the cooling fluid is cooled from the inlet cooling fluid temperature Tfi to the outlet cooling fluid temperature Tfo. In this cooling procedure, the evaporative cooling temperature of the cooling fluid is limited to the wet-bulb temperature Twbi of the induced atmospheric air.
