[0015] In a suitable manner, a powdery polyurethane composition B) comprising the dyes and/or pigments is applied onto the support by powder impregnation, preferably by a dusting process. Also possible are fluidized bed sinter processes, pultrusion or spray processes. The powder (as a whole or a fraction) is preferably applied by dusting processes onto the fibrous support, e.g. onto ribbons of glass, carbon or aramid fibre scrims/fabrics, and then fixed. For avoidance of powder losses, the powder-treated fibrous support is preferably heated in a heated section (e.g. with IR rays) directly after the dusting procedure, so that the particles are sintered on, during which temperatures of 80 to 100.degree. C. should not be exceeded, in order to prevent initiation of reaction of the highly reactive matrix material. These prepregs can as required be combined into different forms and cut to size.
[0016] The production of the prepregs can also be effected by the direct melt impregnation process. The principle of the direct melt impregnation process for the prepregs consists in that firstly a reactive or highly reactive polyurethane composition B) comprising the dyes and/or pigments is produced from the individual components thereof in the melt. This melt of the reactive polyurethane composition B) comprising the dyes and/or pigments is then applied directly onto the fibrous support A), in other words an impregnation of the fibrous support A) with the melt from B) is effected. After this, the cooled storable prepregs can be further processed into composites at a later time. Through the direct melt impregnation process according to the invention, very good impregnation of the fibrous support takes place, due to the fact that the then liquid low viscosity reactive polyurethane compositions wet the fibres of the support very well.
[0017] The production of the prepregs can also be effected using a solvent. The principle of the process for the production of prepregs then consists in that firstly a solution or dispersion comprising the reactive or highly reactive polyurethane composition B) comprising dyes and/or pigments is produced from the individual components thereof in a suitable common solvent. This solution or dispersion of the reactive polyurethane composition B) is then applied directly onto the fibrous support A), whereby the fibrous support becomes soaked/impregnated with this solution. Next, the solvent is removed. Preferably the solvent is removed completely at low temperature, preferably <100.degree. C., e.g. by heat treatment or application of a vacuum. After this, the storable prepregs again freed from the solvent can be further processed to composites at a later time. Through the process according to the invention, very good impregnation of the fibrous support takes place, due to the fact that the solutions of the reactive polyurethane compositions wet the fibres of the support very well.
[0018] As suitable solvents for the process according to the invention, all aprotic liquids can be used which are not reactive towards the reactive polyurethane compositions, exhibit adequate solvent power towards the individual components of the reactive polyurethane composition used and can be removed from the prepreg impregnated with the reactive polyurethane composition during the solvent removal process step apart from slight traces (<0.5 weight %), whereby recycling of the separated solvent is advantageous.
[0019] By way of example, ketones (acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclo-hexanone), ethers (tetrahydrofuran), esters (n-propyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, 1,2-propylene carbonate, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate) may be mentioned here.
