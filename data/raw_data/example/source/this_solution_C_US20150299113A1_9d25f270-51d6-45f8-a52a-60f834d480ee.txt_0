[0030] The initial solution is optionally concentrated, then cooled to 28 to 35.degree. C., to crystallize taurine. The first batch of crude taurine is obtained by filtration, while sodium sulfate remains in solution. Lower temperature is to be avoided to prevent the crystallization of sodium sulfate.
[0031] It is important to point out that sodium sulfate has the maximum solubility at a temperature of 33.degree. C. as shown in FIG. 2. The solubility of sodium sulfate decreases slightly from 33 to 100.degree. C., but drastically from 33 to 0.degree. C. Moreover, sodium sulfate crystallizes as anhydrous form above 40.degree. C., but as Glauber's salt, i.e., sodium sulfate decahydrate at a temperature below 30.degree. C.
[0032] The mother liquor is now consisted of about 30% of sodium sulfate and about 10% of taurine, along with various percentages of sodium ditaurinate and sodium tritaurinate. This solution is concentrated to about one half to one third of its original volume in an evaporative crystallizer, at a temperature from 70 to 95.degree. C., preferably 75 to 85.degree. C., to yield a suspension of sodium sulfate, which is removed by filtration at the same temperature. The temperature is kept high enough to prevent the crystallization of taurine at this stage.
[0033] The filtration mother liquor, now saturated with sodium sulfate and rich in taurine, is cooled to 33-35.degree. C. in the 1.sup.st cooling crystallizer to crystallize the second crop of crude taurine.
[0034] The cycle of evaporative crystallization at higher temperature, preferably from 75 to 85.degree. C., to remove sodium sulfate, and the first cooling crystallization at lower temperature, preferably at 33-35.degree. C., can be continued until the solid content of impurities, mainly sodium ditaurinate and sodium tritaurinate, accumulates to about 30% of the solid content in the mother liquor.
