Dynamic systems such as transportation-systems and in particular vehicles are widely employed. In commercial settings, vehicles such as automobiles, trucks, buses, etc. are relied upon to operate with minimum maintenance over extended periods of time. For many businesses, a fleet of vehicles must be maintained and their usage coordinated for safe and efficient utilization of vehicle resources. For these businesses, downtime, and the random nature of it, is a significant concern. Likewise, passenger vehicles are also widely employed and, for consumers, these vehicles must be maintained to ensure driver and passenger safety.
Notably, such vehicles typically have a plurality of costly subsystems. In most vehicles, at least a small percentage of vehicle subsystems including lubrication, brakes, etc., are prone to failure at any time and, therefore, periodically require maintenance. Typically, maintenance is performed on a schedule (e.g., change the oil every 3,000 miles) without regard to the actual health status of the associated subsystem.
In addition to normal aging and use, failures due to poor or no maintenance and improper operation of the vehicle (e.g., "riding" the brakes, aggressive driving, etc.) take a significant toll on the vehicles, thus resulting in significant expense and logistical problems for the owner. Moreover, this problem is exacerbated when maintaining a large number of vehicles. As a result, a convenient yet inexpensive failure prediction system is desired.
Depending on the application, the failure of a vehicle in service can lead to overall system or process downtime, inconvenience, and potentially, the creation of a hazardous situation. Thus, it is desirable to monitor and diagnose potential failure or faults in these vehicle subsystems early in order to avoid such problems. Absent intelligent monitoring of the subsystems, these problems can have an insidious effect when a problem, although relatively minor and correctable if detected early, goes undetected and yields a set of circumstances that becomes more serious the longer the problem goes undetected. For example, steering and more general torque problems may not become apparent until irreversible damage has occurred. Likewise, problems due to inadequate lubrication, contamination or a multitude of other causes may not become apparent until the subsystems are damaged or a catastrophe occurs.
In order to reduce the probability of failure, preventive maintenance programs have been implemented in which vehicles are periodically serviced and routine maintenance is performed, while data regarding the general health and status of the vehicle is collected and recorded. By routinely conducting such preventive maintenance, vehicle subsystems are serviced whether or not such service is needed. This process results in vehicle downtime, significant costs and requires coordination of scheduled maintenance. Again, such problems are exacerbated when a plurality of vehicles, e.g., a fleet of commercial trucks, must be maintained. When maintenance is performed even though the actual health of the vehicle dictates that it is not necessary, overall process or system costs must be absorbed by the owner of the vehicles.
