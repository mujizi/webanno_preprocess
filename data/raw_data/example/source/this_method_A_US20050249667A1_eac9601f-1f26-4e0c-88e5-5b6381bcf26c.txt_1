[0419] By way of further illustration, the precursor material is selected from the group consisting of antithrombogenic agents, antiplatelet agents, prostaglandins, thrombolytic drugs, antiproliferative drugs, antirejection drugs, antimicrobial drugs, growth factors, and anticalcifying agents.
[0420] By way of yet further illustration, the precursor material may, e.g., be any one or more of the therapeutic agents disclosed in column 5 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,650. Thus, and referring to such column 5, "The therapeutic substance used in the present invention could be virtually any therapeutic substance which possesses desirable therapeutic characteristics for application to a blood vessel. This can include both solid substances and liquid substances. For example, glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone, betamethasone), heparin, hirudin, tocopherol, angiopeptin, aspirin, ACE inhibitors, growth factors, oligonucleotides, and, more generally, antiplatelet agents, anticoagulant agents, antimitotic agents, antioxidants, antimetabolite agents, and anti-inflammatory agents could be used. Antiplatelet agents can include drugs such as aspirin and dipyridamole. Aspirin is classified as an analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet drug. Dypridimole is a drug similar to aspirin in that it has anti-platelet characteristics. Dypridimole is also classified as a coronary vasodilator. Anticoagulant agents can include drugs such as heparin, coumadin, protamine, hirudin and tick anticoagulant protein. Antimitotic agents and antimetabolite agents can include drugs such as methotrexate, azathioprine, vincristine, vinblastine, fluorouracil, adriamycin and mutamycin."
[0421] The precurors material may be one or more of the drugs disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,352, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. As is disclosed in this patent, "Examples of drugs that are thought to be useful in the treatment of restenosis are disclosed in published international patent application WO 91/12779 "Intraluminal Drug Eluting Prosthesis" which is incorporated herein by reference. Therefore, useful drugs for treatment of restenosis and drugs that can be incorporated in the fibrin and used in the present invention can include drugs such as anticoagulant drugs, antiplatelet drugs, antimetabolite drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs and antimitotic drugs. Further, other vasoreactive agents such as nitric oxide releasing agents could also be used . . . . By this method, drugs such as glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone, betamethasone), heparin, hirudin, tocopherol, angiopeptin, aspirin, ACE inhibitors, growth factors, oligonucleotides, and, more generally, antiplatelet agents, anticoagulant agents, antimitotic agents, antioxidants, antimetabolite agents, and anti-inflammatory agents can be applied to a stent . . . ."
[0422] By way of yet further illustration, and referring to U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,696 (the entire disclosure of which is hereby incororporated by reference into this specification), the precursor may be a "selected therapeutic drug" that may be, e.g., " . . . anticoagulant antiplatelet or antithrombin agents such as heparin, D-phe-pro-arg-chloromethylketone (synthetic antithrombin), dipyridamole, hirudin, recombinant hirudin, thrombin inhibitor (available from Biogen), or c7E3 (an antiplatelet drug from Centocore); cytostatic or antiproliferative agents such as angiopeptin (a somatostatin analogue from Ibsen), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as Captopril (available from Squibb), Cilazapril (available from Hoffman-LaRoche), or Lisinopril (available from Merk); calcium channel blockers (such as Nifedipine), colchicine, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) antagonists, fish oil (omega 3-fatty acid), low molecular weight heparin (available from Wyeth, and Glycomed), histamine antagonists, Lovastatin (an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a cholesterol lowering drug from Merk), methotrexate, monoclonal antibodies (such as to PDGF receptors), nitroprusside, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogues, prostaglandin inhibitor (available from Glaxo), Seramin (a PDGF antagonist), serotonin blockers, steroids, thioprotease inhibitors, and triazolopyrimidine (a PDGF antagonist). Other therapeutic drugs which may be appropriate include alphainterferon and genetically engineered epithelial cells, for example."
[0423] By way of yet further illustration, and referring to U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,286 (the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification), precursor material may be a therapeutic agent or drug " . . . including, but not limited to, antiplatelets, antithrombins, cytostatic and antiproliferative agents, for example, to reduce or prevent restenosis in the vessel being treated. The therapeutic agent or drug is preferably selected from the group of therapeutic agents or drugs consisting of sodium heparin, low molecular weight heparin, hirudin, argatroban, forskolin, vapiprost, prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogues, dextran, D-phe-pro-arg-chloromethylketone, dipyridamole, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa platelet membrane receptor antibody, recombinant hirudin, thrombin inhibitor, angiopeptin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, (such as Captopril, available from Squibb; Cilazapril, available for Hoffman-La Roche; or Lisinopril, available from Merck) calcium channel blockers, colchicine, fibroblast growth factor antagonists, fish oil, omega 3-fatty acid, histamine antagonists, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, methotrexate, monoclonal antibodies, nitroprusside, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, prostaglandin inhibitor, seramin, serotonin blockers, steroids, thioprotease inhibitors, triazolopyrimidine and other PDGF antagonists, alpha-interferon and genetically engineered epithelial cells, and combinations thereof."
