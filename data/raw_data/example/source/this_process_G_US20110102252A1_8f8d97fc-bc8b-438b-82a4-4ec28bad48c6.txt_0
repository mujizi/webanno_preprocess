[0052] Here, when the value m is larger than four, i.e., when the relation of m>4 is satisfied, although four variable numbers should be calculated, the number of formulas is larger than four. Thus, the formulas provide an overdeterminacy system. With using a least-square method, a solution is obtained to comply with a limitation that the number of formulas is m as much as possible. Thus, the solution is obtained with the formula (7).
.DELTA.X=(A.sup.TA).sup.-1A.sup.T.DELTA.R (7)
[0053] With using the value of .DELTA.X obtained from the formula (7), the formula (2) is updated. Then, this process is repeated until the estimated value converges. Thus, the position value of the reception position and the clock bias B are calculated.
[0054] The positioning calculator 26 calculates the position coordinates of the reception position with respect to the combination of n satellites and all combinations of (n-1) satellites by an optimum estimation method with the least-square method. Here, the number of all satellites, from which the apparatus receives a satellite signal, is defined as n. The number of combinations of (n-1) satellites is n.
[0055] The positioning calculator 26 calculates a vector v=(v.sub.x, v.sub.y, v.sub.h, d), which represents a speed (i.e., vehicle speed) and a clock drift of the GPS receiver 12, based on the Doppler shift frequency and the satellite position output from the GPS receiver 12 with respect to the combination of n satellites and all combinations of (n-1) satellites by the optimum estimation method with the least-square method. Here, v.sub.x represents a speed in a longitudinal direction, v.sub.y represents a speed in a latitudinal direction, v.sub.h represents a speed in a height direction, and d represents a clock drift. Each speed and the clock drift are calculated by the optimum estimation method, which is disclosed in the book "Practical Programming for GPS," by Takeyasu Sakai, Tokyo Denki University Press, 2007.
