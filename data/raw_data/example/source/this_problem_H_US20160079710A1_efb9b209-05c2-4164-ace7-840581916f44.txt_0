[0007] In particular, "crosstalk" refers to unwanted signal energy that is capacitively and/or inductively coupled onto the conductors of a first "victim" differential pair from a signal that is transmitted over a second "disturbing" differential pair. The induced crosstalk may include both near-end crosstalk (NEXT), which is the crosstalk measured at an input location corresponding to a source at the same location (i.e., crosstalk whose induced voltage signal travels in an opposite direction to that of an originating, disturbing signal in a different path), and far-end crosstalk (FEXT), which is the crosstalk measured at the output location corresponding to a source at the input location (i.e., crosstalk whose signal travels in the same direction as the disturbing signal in the different path). Both types of crosstalk comprise an undesirable noise signal that interferes with the information signal that is transmitted over the victim differential pair.
[0008] While methods are available that can significantly reduce the effects of crosstalk within communications cable segments, the communications connector configurations that were adopted years ago--and which still are in effect in order to maintain backwards compatibility--generally did not maintain the arrangement and geometry of the conductors of each differential pair so as to minimize the crosstalk coupling between the differential pairs in the connector hardware. For example, pursuant to the ANSI/TIA-568-C.2 standard approved Aug. 11, 2009 by the Telecommunications Industry Association (also known as the Category 6a standard), in the connection region where the blades of a modular plug mate with the contacts of the modular jack (referred to herein as the "plug-jack mating region"), the eight conductors 1-8 must be aligned in a row, with the eight conductors 1-8 arranged as four differential pairs specified as depicted in FIG. 2. As is apparent from FIG. 2, this arrangement of the eight conductors 1-8 will result in unequal coupling between the differential pairs, and hence both NEXT and FEXT is introduced in each connector in industry standardized communications systems.
[0009] As the operating frequencies of communications systems has increased, crosstalk in the plug and jack connectors has became a more significant problem. To address this problem, communications jacks now routinely include compensating crosstalk circuits that introduce compensating crosstalk that was used to cancel much of the "offending" crosstalk that is introduced in the plug jack mating region as a result of the industry-standardized connector configurations. Initially, so-called "single-stage" crosstalk compensation circuits were developed that could cancel the "offending" crosstalk that is generated in a plug jack connector because a first conductor of a first differential pair couples more heavily with a first of the two conductors of a second differential pair than does the second conductor of the first differential pair. Typically, these single-stage crosstalk compensation circuits were implemented by configuring the jack so that the second conductor of the first differential pair would couple with the first of the two conductors of the second differential pair later in the jack to provide a "compensating" crosstalk signal. As the first and second conductors of the differential pair carry equal magnitude, but opposite phase signals, so long as the magnitude of the "compensating" crosstalk signal that is induced in such a fashion is equal to the magnitude of the "offending" crosstalk signal, then the compensating crosstalk signal that is introduced later in the jack may substantially cancel out the offending crosstalk signal.
[0010] While the above-described "single-stage" crosstalk compensation circuits were generally effective at cancelling out most of the crosstalk for low frequency signals (e.g., below 100 MHz), as the industry moved to higher frequency signals the phase change between the offending crosstalk signal and the compensating crosstalk signal became more significant such that it became difficult to achieve sufficient crosstalk compensation. Consequently, the use of "multi-stage" crosstalk compensation schemes became common. Such crosstalk schemes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,997,358 to Adriaenssens et al., the entire content of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully herein.
[0011] Work is now ongoing in the industry to develop a Category 8 standard that will specify parameters for higher data rate communications plugs, jacks and cable segments that may operate at higher frequencies. For example, the above-referenced ANSI/TIA-568-C.2 Category 6a standard provides for communications at frequencies up to 500 MHz. In contrast, it is anticipated that the Category 8 standard may call for communications at frequencies up to, for example, 2 GHz. Moreover, it is anticipated that Category 8 connectors (e.g., plug and jacks) may be required to exhibit full backwards compatibility so that they may be used with conventional Category 6 or 6a connectors while meeting the component and channel performance requirements set forth in the Category 6 and 6a standards. Special challenges may be involved in providing communications connectors that can meet the Category 8 performance standards over the full anticipated Category 8 frequency range while also providing full backwards compatibility.
