[0175] As illustrated in FIG. 64, the conferencing system 106 may implement various software mechanisms to obtain the location information from the client device 102. In the embodiment of FIG. 64, the conferencing system 106 comprises a Participant Manager Service 6402, a Location Service 6404, and a Caller ID Service 6406. In operation, the computing device 102 may access the conferencing system 106 by visiting a particular web site. The Participant Manager Service 6402 may send a getClientlPAddress( ) message 6410 to the computing device 102. In response, the client device 102 may send a ClientIP response 6412 containing an IP address associated with the device. It should be appreciated that the IP address may be associated with the client device 102 or other communication devices associated with the client device 102. The Participant Manager Service 6402 may send a getLocationbyIP( ) request 6414 to the Location Service 6404, which returns a response 6416 to the client device 102. The response 6416 may specify location according to, for example, latitude and longitude, or any other means.
[0176] In another embodiment, the client device 102 may access the conferencing system 106 and send a Login Request 6418 to the Participant Manager Service 6402. The Participant Manager Service 6402 may authenticate the participant 104. If the login is successful, the Participant Manager Service 6402 may send a getClientPhoneNumber( ) request 6416 to the client device 102. The participant 104 may provide the information via, for example, a conferencing user interface, such as those described herein or others. The entered telephone number may be provided to the Participant Manager Service 6402 as a PhoneNumber response 6422. The Participant Manager Service 6402 may send a getLocationbyPhoneNumber( ) request 6424 to the Caller ID Service 6406, which contains the entered phone number. The Caller ID Service 6406 may provide corresponding location information to the client device in a response 6426.
[0177] It should be appreciated that additional information may be requested from the client device 102. For example, the Participant Manager Service 6402 may send a getClientCurrentLocation( ) request 6428, and receive a City/State response 6430 containing the entered city, state, zipcode, etc. The Participant Manger Service 6402 may send a getLocationByCity( ) request 6432 (which may include any of the entered information) to the Location Service 6404. The Location Service 6404 may provide corresponding location information to the client device in a response 6434. Regardless of the manner in which the location information is obtained, the client device 102 may send a getMapParticipantLocation( ) request 6436 to a map service 6408. The map service 6408 may return a showMapWithParticipantDetails response 6438. The conferencing system 106 may perform this process for each participant 104 and then present the combined location information in a map view 1908. An exemplary embodiment of a map view 1908 is illustrated in FIG. 18, although it should be appreciated that the location information may be presented in the conference interface in any manner.
[0178] Based on the location information, the conference interface may customize the presentation of the interface with location-based information associated with one or more participants 104. For example, the conferencing system 106 may provide a unique conference interface to each participant 104 based on the participant's corresponding location. The customization may involve providing location-based resources, services, functionality, etc. to the participant 104 (e.g., news, weather, traffic, events, etc.). Furthermore, in some embodiments, a virtual location view 124 may be selected by the conferencing system 106 to match the location information obtained from the participant 104 (e.g., a participant 104 in San Francisco may be presented a virtual location view 124 including the Golden Gate Bridge).
[0179] In further embodiments, the location information may be used to provide an intelligent conference dial-out and/or dial-in feature, which dynamically provides guidance to the participants 104 on how to join the audio conference 114 (e.g., via a login screen 604 (FIG. 6) or setup screens 702 (FIGS. 7 & 8)) or automatically configures an appropriate dial-out from the conferencing system 106 to the participant 104. When a participant 104 accesses the conferencing system 106, the location information may be obtained. Based on the participant location, the conferencing system 106 may recommend a dial-in number, taking into consideration customer data and/or voice plans and carrier provider rates, or automatically determine a desirable dial-out number. For example, based on this information, the conferencing system 106 may select a dial-in number for a more cost-effective incoming call from the participant 104. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the location information may be used to present an optimal (e.g., lowest cost, highest quality) dial-in option, as well as the optimal dial-out. The conferencing system 106 may dial-out to the participant 104 after checking, for example, a routing database and then initiating the dial-out from the optimal node on the network based on the acquired location information.
