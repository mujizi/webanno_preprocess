[0165] Apyrase is an enzyme that degrades residual unincorporated nucleotides converting them into di- and ultimately mono-phosphates (and thereby rendering them unsuitable for DNA synthesis). It is therefore useful for degrading dNTPs that are not incorporated and/or that are in excess following a dNTP flow through. It is important that excess and/or unreacted dNTP be washed away before introduction of the subsequent dNTP in order to accurately determine the nucleotide that is incorporated and that is associated with the change in length of the template. Accordingly, addition of apyrase between the introduction of different dNTPs removes excess dNTPs that would otherwise confuse the sequencing data.
[0166] Additional amounts of sequencing reaction reagents such as those described above may be added throughout the reaction particularly if depletion of these reagents is expected, although in some cases this may not be necessary. For example, additional polymerase, DTT, SBB and the like may be added if necessary.
[0167] The sequencing reaction can be run at a range of temperatures. Typically, the reaction is run in the range of 30-60.degree. C., 35-55.degree. C., or 40-45 C. It may be preferable in some embodiments to run the reaction at temperatures that prevent formation of secondary structure in the template. However this temperature must also accommodate binding of the primer (and the newly synthesized strand) to the template and the reduced half-life of apyrase at higher temperatures. A suitable temperature is about 41.degree. C. The solutions including the wash buffers and the dNTP solutions are generally warmed to these temperatures in order not to alter the temperature in the flow cell. The wash buffer containing apyrase however is preferably maintained at a lower temperature in order to extend its half-life. Typically, this solution is maintained at about 4-15.degree. C., and more preferably at about 4-10.degree. C.
[0168] The length of the oligonucleotide will be dictated by the length of the target. If a read-length of 1,000 bases is desired, the ssDNA region between two hybridized primers (essentially the length of the target) is at least about 1,000 nucleotides. Assuming a 3 pN flow, this number of nucleotides represents a length of about 50 nm in length, equivalent to about 150 base pair dsDNA. The activity of the tethered polymerase will remain on the primer upstream from that to which it is tethered because of the flow. An additional advantage of this configuration is that the distance to be covered by the tether becomes shorter as the polymerase synthesizes more and therefore the system actually improves at longer read lengths.
[0169] Other aspects of the invention are not sequencing-by-synthesis methods. In these aspects, sequencing may be carried out by hybridizing oligonucleotides (or probes) of known sequence to immobilized templates and detecting such hybridization by changes in the length of the template. The oligonucleotides may or may not have exogenous detectable labels on them, such as fluorophores or other optical labels. The invention is independent of the presence of such labels as the methods do not rely on detecting the hybridized oligonucleotides themselves but rather detecting the change in template length as a result of such hybridization.
