Example 83
3-chloro-2-ethyl-4-(2-methyl-[1,3]dioxolane-2-yl)-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0332]The compound of Example 74 (2.60 g) was dissolved in benzene (100 mL). To this solution, ethylene glycol (5 mL) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (130 mg) were added and the mixture was stirred for 5.5 hours under reflux (Dean-Stark apparatus). The reaction was terminated by adding a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and the mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure and purification by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=4:1) afforded the title compound as a colorless oil (3.07 g).
