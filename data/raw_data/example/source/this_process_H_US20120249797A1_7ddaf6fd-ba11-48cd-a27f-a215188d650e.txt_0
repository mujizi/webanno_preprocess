[0425] FIG. 32 depicts a typical camera 3200 for use in video calling or conferencing. Such cameras are typically small and could be mounted on a watch 3202, as shown in FIG. 32, cell phone or other portable computing device, including a laptop computer. Video calling works by connecting the device controller with the cell phone or other communications device. The devices utilize software compatible with the operating system of the glasses and the communications device or computing device. In an embodiment, the screen of the augmented reality glasses may display a list of options for making the call and the user may gesture using a pointing control device or use any other control technique described herein to select the video calling option on the screen of the augmented reality glasses.
[0426] FIG. 33 illustrates an embodiment 3300 of a block diagram of a video-calling camera. The camera incorporates a lens 3302, a CCD/CMOS sensor 3304, analog to digital converters for video signals, 3306, and audio signals, 3314. Microphone 3312 collects audio input. Both analog to digital converters 3306 and 3314 send their output signals to a signal enhancement module 3308. The signal enhancement module 3308 forwards the enhanced signal, which is a composite of both video and audio signals to interface 3310. Interface 3310 is connected to an IEEE 1394 standard bus interface, along with a control module 3316.
[0427] In operation, the video call camera depends on the signal capture which transforms the incident light, as well as incident sound into electrons. For light this process is performed by CCD or CMOS chip 3304. The microphone transforms sound into electrical impulses.
[0428] The first step in the process of generating an image for a video call is to digitize the image. The CCD or CMOS chip 3304 dissects the image and converts it into pixels. If a pixel has collected many photons, the voltage will be high. If the pixel has collected few photons, the voltage will be low. This voltage is an analog value. During the second step of digitization, the voltage is transformed into a digital value by the analog to digital converter 3306, which handles image processing. At this point, a raw digital image is available.
[0429] Audio captured by the microphone 3312 is also transformed into a voltage. This voltage is sent to the analog to digital converter 3314 where the analog values are transformed into digital values.
