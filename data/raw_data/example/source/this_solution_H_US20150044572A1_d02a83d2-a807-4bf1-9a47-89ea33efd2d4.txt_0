[0045] A representative example of an alkaline battery in the form of a nickel-zinc battery will now be described, The anode structure 2 is metal sheet formed from steel comprising a nickel coating The electrolyte 7 in the anode may comprise porous carbon powder and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH).sub.2) powder, all of which is mixed in a binder.
[0046] The cathode structure 3 is a metal sheet formed from steel comprising a nickel coating. The electrolyte 8 in the cathode conductive foam may also contain porous carbon powder and zinc oxide (ZnO) powder, all of which is mixed thoroughly in a binder prior to use. Typically, the number of moles of zinc oxide used is approximately half that of the nickel hydroxide, in view of the stoichiometry of the electrochemical reaction. The electrochemistry of the nickel zinc battery will be well known to the skilled reader, and therefore further details are not provided herein. The active additives in the anode and cathode structures (the nickel hydroxide, zinc oxide and carbon powder) are typically present as fine powders having particle sizes in the range 1 to 10 .mu.m.
[0047] The structural separator 6 is formed from a plain weave E-glass fabric embedded in the binder matrix. Other electrically insulating fibres such as silicon carbide which provide suitable structural reinforcement might be used instead. Other separators such as microporous polymer films may be used either alone or in combination with the glass fabric. The structural separator 6 contains an aqueous electrolyte consisting of 40% by weight potassium hydroxide in deionised water. Zinc oxide is dissolved in this solution until saturation or near saturation is achieved.
[0048] The electrolyte is stored within the pores of the conductive foams 4 and 5. A porous additive, such as a silica or a silica gel, may be used to provide a more open cell structure or a microporous polymer film may be employed. Vents may be provided to control the release of gases during overcharge conditions and fill/drain ports may be fitted to permit the introduction and removal of the aqueous electrolyte for maintenance or storage.
[0049] The battery of the invention can be manufactured in different ways. For example, it is possible to fully manufacture each of the anode and cathode structures and the structural separator separately and subsequently bond these completed structures together. Alternatively, each structure may be produced separately.
