[0058] The lens section 120 coated with the adhesive polymer 130 is arranged in a predetermined position from an alignment layer 135 which is formed on a side of the substrate 125.
[0059] The alignment layer 135 is a thin-film layer pre-formed on the substrate 125. The alignment layer serves as a marker for arranging the lens section 120 in a predetermined position. Due to considerable thinness of the alignment layer 135, in case where the mold 110 having the lens section 120 is adhered to the substrate 125 via the adhesive polymer 130, the alignment layer 135 does not affect the amount of the adhesive polymer 130 adhered to the lens section 120. Thus, the alignment layer 135 only serves as a marker for arrangement.
[0060] Through this process, a transparent substrate 125 is adhered to the adhesive polymer 130. Ultraviolet ray is irradiated through the transparent substrate 125 so that the adhesive polymer 130 is cured and adhered integrally to the substrate 125.
[0061] Even in the curing process stated above, the adhesive polymer 130 may shrink, causing bubbles to remain inside. However, owing to a small amount of the adhesive polymer 130 and its thickness of .mu.m, such shrinkage and bubble generation do not affect quality of the lens section 120.
[0062] Then, according to the invention, the mold 110 is removed from the lens section 120 to produce a lens (see FIG. 7c). That is, the mold 110 is released from the lens section 120, leaving the lens section 120 on a side of the substrate 125.
