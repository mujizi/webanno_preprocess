Preparation of Bis(6-sulfonyl-3-diazo-4-oxo-3,4-dihydrocoumarin)bisphenol A
This Example illustrates the method of attaching ballast groups to the photo active compounds of the present invention. A 500 mL three-necked, round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, water bath, thermocouple, nitrogen inlet and bubbler was charged with a solution of bisphenol A (3.9 g, 16.9 mmol) in THF (50.0 g). Triethylamine (8.3 g) was then added to this solution dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir for five minutes. A solution of 6-chlorosulfonyl-3-diazo-4-oxo-3,4-dihydrocoumarin (10.078 g, 35.2 mmol; from Example 2) in THF (196 g) was added dropwise and the reaction was allowed to stir at room temperature for about four hours, the reaction mixture was then filtered to remove any insoluble impurities. The filtrate was precipitated in nine times its weight of petroleum ether. The resulting slurry was filtered and the filtercake was dried overnight at 60.degree. C. under vacuum, providing 12.5 g pink solids. The crude product was dissolved in 554 g chloroform. The solution was washed with 378 g water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solution was filtered and the filtrate was stirred with 1.8 g of decolorizing charcoal and was filtered. The product was precipitated by pouring over 2122 g of petroleum ether, filtered, and dried in a vacuum oven, overnight at 60.degree. C.; yield 8.9 g (72%). The product was characterized by .sup.13 C NMR, DSC and UV-Vis. The product melted with decomposition at 200.degree. C. .sup.13 C-NMR in CDCl.sub.3 solvent showed 15 singlet lines at the following chemical shifts, in ppm: 171.999, 156.833, 156.475, 149.533, 147.198, 135.124, 132.912, 128.263, 127.444, 121.742, 119.466, 119.291, 77.206, 42.700, 30.692. The UV absorption spectrum of the product in THF solvent was determined at a dilution factor, DF=116,494.72 yielding, .lambda.1 max=228 nm, .epsilon.1 max=84,528.6 liters/mole cm; and .lambda.2 max=288 nm, .epsilon.2 max=20,956.83 liters/mole cm.
