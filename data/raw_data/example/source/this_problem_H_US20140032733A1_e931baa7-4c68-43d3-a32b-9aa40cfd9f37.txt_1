[0439] Aspects described herein give the user the choice to customize these actions according to their preferences, utilizing triggers that are provided by devices. Users can customize these actions either by explicitly specifying them, or they can rely on the system observing user behavior and following their preferences.
[0440] One known solution to the above recited problems is to manually carry out the orchestration steps between devices to achieve some of the features the software described herein provides, such as manually connecting to a meeting by dialing the PSTN bridge information while in the car, despite the dangers of doing so.
[0441] Other features of the software described herein, such as triggers that invoke when a user is not physically present, cannot be achieved at the moment, and the user lives without such features. Limited known previous attempts at this problem involve solutions such as web mashups, including technologies like OnX and IFTTT. However, these technologies are focused on bringing together different web sites and some features of mobile devices. They are not broader technologies that cover the wider range of devices that are part of "the internet of things". Still other known technologies include standards such as X10, DMX and ZWave. However, these are home automation technologies focused on devices and sensors such as light, motion sensors, and motorized control of items in the home.
[0442] One known solution to the multi-device problem is to manually dedicate specific devices to specific roles, through manual manipulation of software on devices. For example, in the context of online meeting software, this can mean making the laptop screen minimize the video part of the meeting, to allow screen sharing to take up the screen, and mirroring this to the room display. It also means manually muting all speakers other than that of the smartphone, which is acting as the microphone. It also means making the tablet maximize the video display of the online meeting software. Once after this is done, a single user appears to be connected multiple times in the list of users in a meeting, which provides a sub optimal user experience. For other situations, such as launching an application from one device onto another, there are no existing solutions in place. Thus, existing solutions, to the extent they exist, are laborious, manually driven and error prone.
[0443] FIG. 27 shows multi-device use according to illustrative aspects described herein. The system of FIG. 27 outlines the way that items are spread across devices, as well as ways that users may trigger cross device interactions. As shown by way of example in FIG. 27, a user may select content at one computing device to share with another computing device. The user may select the content to share and then select one of the other computing devices connected via the orchestration framework. Upon selection of the selected computing device (the destination computing device), the selected content may be transferred to the selected computing device. As seen in FIG. 27, various approaches may be selectively employed to present or display a set of computing devices available for selection as the device to receive the selected content. In one approach, the computing devices available for selection may "peek" in from the edges of the interface as selectable targets of a drag-and-drop action. In another approach the computing devices available for selection may be presented as a set of selectable icons. In a further approach, the computing devices available for selection may be presented as selectable entries in a list of computing devices. Similar approaches may be employed in order to request that a computing device perform at least a portion of a computing activity initiated at another computing device. Moreover, the set of computing devices presented as available for selection may be dynamically generated or configured based on, e.g., the computing devices associated with the computing device, the computing devices associated with a user of the computing device, the computing devices co-located with the computing device, operation modes of the computing device, operation modes of applications at the computing devices, whether the computing devices are capable of presenting the content or performing the computing activity, based on whether the computing devices are permitted to present the content or perform the computing activity, and additional or alternative criteria that will be appreciated with the benefit of this disclosure.
