[0068] In the second stage of the two-stage process, the z plane(s) in which the sought object or objects lie are determined, using only the data from these object areas or the corresponding partial regions of the further images, in order to be able to image them sharply.
[0069] For example, the result of the picture variance analysis of the respective partial regions can serve as focus measurement value. This focus measurement value is calculated in several z planes (of the different images) at the same xy position (same partial regions) and an estimation of the measurement value curve (focus curve) over the whole z region is carried out e.g. based on these focus measurement values. With the customary assumption that the maximum of the focus curve points to the focal plane, the computer activates the motor of the microscope 1 via the control module 8 to adjust the distance between specimen stage 3 and microscope lens system 4 to the distance corresponding to the curve maximum (or the corresponding z coordinates).
[0070] Through this process, it is advantageously achieved that a reliable automatic focussing is ensured as only the desired objects 9 within the specimen 6 are subjected to the focus analysis. Other objects 10 which sometimes slightly negatively influence the focus search are not taken into account in the determination according to the invention of the focal plane.
[0071] In one development, it is possible for the user to mark incorrectly focussed objects in the automatically focussed picture. In this case, the training algorithm is carried out once more with this additional information, preferably as a background process of which the user is not made aware, in order to achieve an improved recognition of the sought objects 9 in the next automatic focussing.
[0072] In a further variant, a further pattern recognition based on a different set of features can be carried out after the automatic focussing. With this set of features, it is possible for example not to take account of a defocus portion (as e.g. no convolution with low-pass functions), but only rotations.
