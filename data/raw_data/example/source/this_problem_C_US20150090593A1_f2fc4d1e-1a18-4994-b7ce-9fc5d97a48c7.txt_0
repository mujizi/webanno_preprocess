[0006] Although the use of the above chemical techniques are effective, they have the shortcoming in that it is maintenance time consuming and costly to maintain and operate membrane systems affected by mineral scale and requires the installation of cation and anion exchange filtration and ongoing dosing of antiscalant chemicals. For instance, it is difficult and costly to accurately predict the maximum concentrations of the sparingly soluble solutes in excess of recorded solubility limits that can be tolerated with antiscalant chemicals.
[0007] Further, in the case of cation exchange softeners, these only work in low salinity applications because higher salt content in the water reduces the positively charged bonding and/or attraction of calcium to the media
[0008] Prior known systems have incorporated voltage based signal drive systems for driving signals into coils in an attempt to treat or condition fluid to avoid or remove scaling. However, these systems generally use and/or waste a large amount of power in generating the drive signals, which can lead to problems where the fluid treatment plants are remote from mains power supplies. Further, this problem may be exacerbated when the signals are being driven into low ohmic loads which then require increased power consumption. This can lead to a loss of fluid conditioning in systems that may have a limited power supply.
[0009] Further, prior known fluid treatment methods associated with bore holes require ground fluid (e.g. water) to be extracted from a bore hole using a submersible pump. After the water has been extracted, the water may then be treated or conditioned. However, the submersible pump itself may have scale formed therein, thus reducing the capacity of the water being pumped and reducing the working life of the pump itself.
[0010] An object of the present invention is to provide one or more improved systems and methods for the conditioning of fluids, or to at least provide the public with a useful choice.
