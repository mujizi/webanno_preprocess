[0020] When the polarity of the second derivative Q1 (=p1+p3-2p2) is positive, the spectral distribution curve is a downwardly convex curve. When the polarity is negative, the spectral distribution curve is an upwardly convex curve. When the second derivative Q1 is 0, the spectral distribution changes in a straight line. Moreover, when the curvature of the spectral distribution curve is large (the change in the spectral intensity is abrupt), the actual measurement data p3 increases. As a result, the absolute value of the second derivative Q1 increases.
[0021] That is, the second derivative Q1 (positive or negative) serves as information on the shape of the spectral distribution curve (information on whether the curve is upwardly convex or downwardly convex) and information on the abruptness of the change in the curvature of the spectral distribution.
[0022] Focusing on this property, in this aspect of the invention, the second derivative Q1 is used as the basic data for calculation of the correction value, and the second derivative Q1 is multiplied by a correction coefficient k1 (k1 is a real number) (that is, the magnitude thereof is appropriately adjusted), and the result of multiplication is used as the correction value. If k1=1, the second derivative Q1 is used as the correction value as it is. Moreover, although the correction coefficient k1 is basically a positive real number excluding 0, k1 may exceptionally be set to 0 (for example, when no correction is executed). According to this method, the correction value of which the magnitude is variably controlled can be generated quickly (for example, real-time) by a simple method (simple configuration).
[0023] (5) According to another aspect of the invention, in the spectral measurement device, that when, among the first to n-th wavelengths, an m-th wavelength band (1.ltoreq.m.ltoreq.n, and m is an integer) is an interest wavelength band, and a k-th wavelength band (k.noteq.m, 1.ltoreq.k.ltoreq.n, and k is an integer) other than the m-th wavelength band is a non-interest wavelength band, the optical band-pass filter section functions as an m-th band-pass filter corresponding to the m-th wavelength band and also functions as a k-th band-pass filter corresponding to the k-th wavelength band, the correction operation section further includes a noise estimation section that estimates the amount of the noise component for each wavelength band of the k-th wavelength band included in an interest reception signal obtained by the light receiving section receiving transmission light or reflection light of the m-th band-pass filter corresponding to the m-th wavelength band, and a noise removal and correction section that performs correction of subtracting the sum of the estimated noise component for each wavelength band from the interest reception signal, and the correction operation section executes correction of the reception signal by the noise estimation section and the noise removal and correction section and then executes the correction based on the change in the spectral distribution of the reception signal.
[0024] In this aspect of the invention, in addition to the integration error correction (correction which mainly aims to suppress spreading of errors at positions where the change in the spectral distribution curve is large), by executing a correction operation (base floating correction) for suppressing a noise component (component of wavelengths other than a desired wavelength band) superimposed on the spectroscopic data, more highly accurate correction is achieved.
