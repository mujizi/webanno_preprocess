Example 81
2-ethyl-4-propionyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0325]The compound of Example 77 (3.08 g) was dissolved in THF (160 mL) in an argon atmosphere. While this solution was kept at -78.degree. C., 1.00 mol/L lithium bistrimethylsilylamide/THF solution (18.0 mL) was added dropwise. The resulting mixture was stirred for 3.5 hours as it was allowed to gradually warm to -30.degree. C. Subsequently, methyl iodide (1.10 mL) was added dropwise at -78.degree. C. and the mixture was stirred for another 6 hours as it was allowed to gradually warm to room temperature. A saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride was then added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=3:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (1.37 g).
