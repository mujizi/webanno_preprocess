Known methods for cooling the walls of combustors permit air discharged by the compressor to pass through the combustor wall, and then direct it along the inside surface thereof, as a film to protect it from direct contact with the hot gas. This arrangement permits the combustor wall to operate significantly below the temperature of the hot gas. This film cooling method has been used for limited areas of the transition duct, especially those poorly cooled areas described above. However, the use of such film cooling is limited by the amount of air available exclusively for cooling the combustor and transition duct walls. This amount is typically less than thirty percent of the total air flow available to the combustor. For an advanced heavy duty gas turbine engine, virtually all of the air available for film cooling is required for cooling the combustor walls, and very little is available for cooling the transition duct walls. This limited availablity of cooling air flow comes about because approximately half of the total combustor air flow is required for complete combustion of the fuel and another quarter of the air flow is required for dilution and shaping of the hot gas profile exiting the combustor as required by the first turbine stage for acceptable efficiency and component life. These proportions can be altered slightly, depending on the particular design choices in a gas turbine engine, but a variety of practical obstacles blocks any large departure from them.
Another cooling technique which has found use in cooling the exterior of the transition duct employs an impingement plate, baffle or sleeve disposed a short distance away from the transition duct outer surface. The impingement sleeve contains an array of holes through which compressor discharge air passes to generate an array of air jets which impinge on and cool the outer surface of the transition duct.
U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,181 discloses such an impingement cooling technique for a transition duct in which the impingement sleeve surrounds only a portion of the transition duct. After impacting the surface to be cooled, the spent impingement air flows in the space between the transition duct outer surface and the impingement sleeve, towards holes in the transition duct. The air passing through these holes mixes with, and reduces the hot gas temperature just ahead of, the root area of the turbine blades and thus helps reduce the metal temperature of this portion of the turbine blades. Depending upon the heat transfer rate from the hot gas and the maximum allowed metal temperature, this method can use less cooling air than film cooling to maintain acceptable metal temperatures, and can be used in combination with film cooling to further reduce metal temperature. However, even the combination of impingement and film cooling for a transition duct would require more cooling air than is available in an advanced heavy duty gas turbine.
Further disclosure of impingement cooling of a gas turbine combustion component is found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,339,925. Although it is directed toward cooling a type of gas turbine combustion component which is completely different from that towards which the present invention is directed, this patent discloses typical elements of an impingement cooling system. There is disclosed therein a shell which has an array of holes through which cooling air passes to impinge on a hot gas casing towards the combustor. An embodiment is illustrated and described in which the impingement air flows along the hot gas casing eventually to enter the combustion process. A restrictor is disclosed for aiding the ejection of air from the space between the hot gas casing and the perforated shell. This patent recognizes that the number of inlet openings, as well as the spacing of the shell from the hot gas casing, represent variables which can be employed to produce the cooling effects required by the situation.
It can be seen from the prior art, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,652,181 and 4,339,925, that impingement cooling of a combustion component can either consume a portion of the air flow allocated to the combustion process, or be performed in series with the combustor such that the air used to cool a combustion component is subsequently used in the combustion process. It is the series mode of cooling a transition duct which is addressed by the present invention.
