[0014]In the second mechanism, no protective oxide layer is formed. Instead, the constituents in the solution chemically attack and dissolve the metal, while the mechanical action is largely one of mechanically enhancing the dissolution rate by such processes as continuously exposing more surface area to chemical attack, raising the local temperature (which increases the dissolution rate) by the friction between the particles and the metal and enhancing the diffusion of reactants and products to and away from the surface by mixing and by reducing the thickness of the boundary layer.
[0015]While prior art CMP systems are capable of removing a copper overlayer from a silicon dioxide substrate, the systems do not satisfy the rigorous demands of the semiconductor industry. These requirements can be summarized as follows. First, there is a need for high removal rates of copper to satisfy throughput demands. Secondly, there must be excellent topography uniformity across the substrate. Finally, the CMP method must minimize defectivity levels on polished substrates that are imparted during polishing as well as local dishing and erosion effects to satisfy ever increasing lithographic demands.
[0016]U.S. Pat. No. 6,979,252 discloses the importance of using colloidal silica-based slurries having low levels of soluble polymeric silicates as abrasives in these slurries in order to realize low defectivity levels during CMP processing or other processing. There are several aspects to the '252 patent. In one aspect, the '252 patent provides a method for separating and removing soluble polymeric silicates in a colloidal silica polishing slurry prior to a CMP process; this method involves centrifugation of a polishing slurry to afford a product slurry in which the product slurry has a lower level of soluble polymeric silicates (and lower defectivity level) than does the polishing slurry. In another aspect, the '252 patent provides a product slurry prepared according to the aforementioned method from a polishing slurry; this product slurry has a lower level of soluble polymeric silicates than does the polishing slurry. Consequently, this product slurry affords lower defectivity levels during CMP processing or other processing than does the polishing slurry. A third aspect of the '252 patent entails use of a product slurry prepared according to the aforementioned method in a chemical mechanical polishing slurry instead of polishing slurry, such that use of the product slurry affords a lower number of post polish defects than does use of the polishing slurry. The '252 patent has examples that are all focused on oxide CMP; there are no examples on metal CMP, including no examples on copper CMP in particular.
[0017]There is a significant need for copper CMP process(es) with colloidal silica slurries that afford low defectivity levels on copper surfaces during polishing with these slurries. The present invention provides a solution to this significant need.
[0018]In an embodiment, the invention is a composition for chemical mechanical planarization of a surface having at least one feature thereon comprising copper, said composition comprising colloidal silica that is substantially free of soluble polymeric silicates.
