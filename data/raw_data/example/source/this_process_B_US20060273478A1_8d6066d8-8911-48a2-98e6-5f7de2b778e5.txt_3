[0055] Therefore, shrinkage caused during curing of polymer 115 is transferred toward an exposed surface P' which is not yet cured. The lens section 120 is finally cured with its exposed surface P' suffering from shrinkage. Consequently, such exposed surface P' is deformed. Moreover, bubbles which may build up inside the lens section 120 in this process freely exit to the air through the exposed surface P' without remaining inside
[0056] According to the invention, as explained above, the lens section 120 is formed in the grooves 110a of the mold through just one molding process. But the invention is not limited thereto. In case of a much higher sag, polymer may be split-injected into the grooves 110 of the mold and cured repeatedly by ultraviolet ray to form the lens section 120.
[0057] Thereafter, a substrate is adhered integrally to a back side of the lens section 120 (see FIG. 7b). In this step, as described regarding FIGS. 5a to 5c, the lens section 120 of the mold 110 is coated with an adhesive polymer 130 having a composition identical to polymer 115 of the lens section 120. The adhesive polymer 130 is adhered to a predetermined position of the substrate 125. In this process, the adhesive polymer 130 is coated in a liquid state, thereby correcting unevenness of the exposed surface P'.
[0058] The lens section 120 coated with the adhesive polymer 130 is arranged in a predetermined position from an alignment layer 135 which is formed on a side of the substrate 125.
[0059] The alignment layer 135 is a thin-film layer pre-formed on the substrate 125. The alignment layer serves as a marker for arranging the lens section 120 in a predetermined position. Due to considerable thinness of the alignment layer 135, in case where the mold 110 having the lens section 120 is adhered to the substrate 125 via the adhesive polymer 130, the alignment layer 135 does not affect the amount of the adhesive polymer 130 adhered to the lens section 120. Thus, the alignment layer 135 only serves as a marker for arrangement.
