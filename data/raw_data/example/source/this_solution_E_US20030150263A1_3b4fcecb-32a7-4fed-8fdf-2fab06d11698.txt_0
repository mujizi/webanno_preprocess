[0034] where .alpha..sub.i and .beta..sub.i are functions of each cylinder's elastic constants: 15i =( 1 - 2 v i)( 1 + v i )E i i = 1 + v iE i,
[0035] v.sub.i is Poisson's ratio, and E.sub.i is Young's Modulus. The constants A.sub.i and B.sub.i are determined from the pressure applied to the ID and OD of cylinder i: 16 A i = 1 2 b i 2P i -a i 2P i - 1 b i 2 - a i 2 B i = a i 2 b i 2 ( P i - 1 - P i ) b i 2 - a i 2.
[0036] The unknown pressures, P.sub.i, between individual cylinders are determined using the requirement of displacement continuity between individual, touching, circular cylinders. Applying the boundary and continuity conditions leads to n-1 discrete, linear equations for the n-1 unknown contact pressures. With this solution, the stresses and displacements can now be estimated using the constants A.sub.i and B.sub.i.
[0037] The above solution works if the far field stresses are known or symmetrical. However, because that is not often the case, it would be helpful if there were a way to quickly and accurately find the far field stresses, the true well departure angle relative to the principal stress orientation, and to use that information to calculate fracture direction geometries in order to find the most useful placement of a hydraulic fracture.
[0038] In one aspect, embodiments of the invention feature techniques for determining and validating the result of a fracturing operation by taking advantage of the accuracy and speed of the boundary equation method of mathematics. While on-line pressure monitoring can provide some useful information about the status of a fracturing operation, it is not enough to characterize completely and uniquely the system, and additional information is required, especially for inclined wells. These measurements monitor the fracturing operation continuously and measure the process variables directly, such as well pressure, wellbore surface stresses, and displacements, which can provide useful on-line information to determine the profile of the propagating fracture.
