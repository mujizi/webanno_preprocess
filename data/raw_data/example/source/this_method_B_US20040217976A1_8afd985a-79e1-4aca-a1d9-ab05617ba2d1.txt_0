[0006] The present invention is directed toward methods and systems for presenting to occupants of a moving vehicle an image of a view external to the vehicle. A system in accordance with one aspect of the invention includes a first signal receiving portion configured to receive a signal corresponding to an image of a view external to a vehicle, and a second signal receiving portion configured to receive a signal corresponding to a speed of the vehicle. A signal processing portion is configured to direct to a first display portion positioned at a first location of the vehicle a first signal corresponding to the image, and direct to a second display portion positioned at a second location of the vehicle a second signal corresponding to the image, with the second location being different than the first location. The signal processing portion is further configured to delay the second signal by a time that corresponds at least approximately inversely to the speed. Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention, passengers within a moving vehicle can receive time-delayed images that simulate what the passengers would see as their seats pass a fixed point.
[0007] In a further aspect of the invention, the vehicle can include an aircraft. In another aspect of the invention, the signal processing portion can be configured to synchronize the first and second signals when the aircraft is airborne. In still a further aspect of the invention, the vehicle can include first and second laterally spaced apart wheels, with a first speed sensor operatively coupled to the first wheel to detect its speed, and a second wheel sensor operatively coupled to the second wheel to detect its speed. Accordingly, the system can account for turning motions of the vehicle.
[0008] A method in accordance with another aspect of the invention includes receiving a signal corresponding to an image of a view external to a vehicle and receiving a signal corresponding to a speed of the vehicle. The method can further include directing to a first display portion positioned at a first location of the vehicle a first signal corresponding to the image, and directing to a second display portion positioned at a second location of the vehicle a second signal corresponding to the image, with the second location being spaced apart from the first location. The method can further include delaying the second signal by a time that corresponds at least approximately inversely to the speed. In further aspects of this method, the signal corresponding to the speed of the vehicle can include a signal corresponding to a linear speed of the vehicle and/or a rotational speed of the vehicle.
