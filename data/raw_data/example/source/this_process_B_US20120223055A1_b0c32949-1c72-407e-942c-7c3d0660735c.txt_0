[0131] [Step SA05] Only the lower wire guide is moved and thus the wire electrode is brought into contact with the workpiece so as to detect and store a position of the lower wire guide at a time of the contact.
[0132] [Step SA06] Only the lower wire guide is moved so as to return the lower wire guide to the position A.
[0133] [Step SA07] A coordinate value of the position where the wire electrode contacts with the workpiece is calculated and the board thickness of the workpiece is calculated from the calculated coordinate value. Then, this processing is ended.
[0134] As supplement description of the above-described flowchart, a "wire electrode inclination angle calculating unit", a "workpiece upper surface position calculating unit", a "workpiece lower surface calculating unit", and a "board thickness calculating unit", which constitutes the wire-cut electric discharge machine according to the present invention, perform the function of step SA07 described above. In this step SA07, calculations for obtaining an inclination angle of the wire electrode, a workpiece upper surface position, a workpiece lower surface position, and board thickness of the workpiece are performed by using the formulas (1) to (24).
[0135] In the above description, it is described that the end surface of the workpiece 6 is a vertical surface. The end surface of the workpiece 6 is not a complete vertical surface in reality and has some error. Commonly, the workpiece 6 which is machined with the wire-cut electric discharge machine has thickness ranging from small thickness of approximately 5 mm to large thickness of 300 mm or more.
