Continuous infusion IV therapy may be generally divided between peripheral IV therapy and central venous IV therapy, depending on the site of administration. Catheters used for peripheral IV therapy tend to be short, between 3/4" and 11/4" long, or occasionally 2" long for insertion into a deep vein. Catheters for central venous IV therapy tend to be much longer, and are outside the scope of the present invention.
A peripheral IV catheter is made of soft, flexible plastic or silicon, generally between 16 gauge and 24 gauge. In the conventional venipuncture the catheter is inserted into a vein in the patient's hand, foot, or the inner aspect of the arm or any vein in the body that will accept an IV catheter. When inserting a peripheral IV catheter, an IV infusion set is prepared, the IV tubing being filled with fluid and any air eliminated from the tubing, closing the fluid clamp. A tourniquet is applied proximal to the venipuncture site, and a variety of techniques are used to dilate the vein. Wearing disposable gloves, the venipuncture site is cleansed and a vein is retracted or anchored by placing a thumb over the vein about two to three inches distal to the site. A catheter with a stylet advanced through its lumen so that the pointed tip extends beyond the cannula of the catheter, or a butterfly needle, is introduced into the vein by inserting the bevel into the vein at about a 20.degree. to 30.degree. angle with the bevel facing up in order to pierce one wall of the vein. Blood return in the tubing of the butterfly needle or the flashback chamber of the over the needle catheter indicates that the vein has been entered, and the needle is lowered towards the skin and the catheter is advanced about 1/4" into the vein. The stylet is loosened and the catheter is gently advanced farther up into the vein until the hub of the catheter is against the venipuncture site. The tourniquet is loosened and the needle or stylet is removed from the catheter. The needle adaptor of the infusion tubing is secured to the hub of the catheter, and the roller clamp is opened. The flow rate may be controlled either by adjusting the roller clamp or an infusion pump, and the catheter is secured to the venipuncture site by gauze and adhesive tape.
During this process medical personnel are exposed to the possibility of an accidental needle puncture or to contamination from the back flow of the patient's blood from the venipuncture site.
Many protective devices have been developed to prevent accidental needle puncture during the insertion of the IV catheter. U.S. Pat. No. 4,444,203, issued Apr. 24, 1984 to A. Engleman, shows a combination device for inserting an IV catheter and withdrawing blood. The device includes a hub having a hypodermic needle at one end adapted for releasably holing an over the needle catheter, and a vacuum container penetrating needle covered by a resilient sleeve at the other end of the hub. A vacuum container for collecting blood slides over the vacuum needle, compressing the sleeve so the needle penetrates the sleeve. The catheter may be inserted with or without the vacuum container in place, blood samples are collected, and the entire assembly except the catheter itself are removed.
Other blood collection devices are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,509,534, issued Apr. 9, 1985 to M. J. Tassin, Jr. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,819,659, issued Apr. 11, 1989 to D. L. Sitar. The Tassin device describes a device for collecting blood which taps into an IV catheter system through an entry means, but does not describe a catheter insertion system or apparatus. The Sitar patent describes a blood withdrawing device with a needle guard to prevent accidental puncture wounds, including a guard which slides forward to cover the needle, locking on a lock which is molded onto the shaft of the needle to lock the guard in position.
