[0090] In yet other aspects, the present disclosure contemplates a method for forming an anti-friction coating for a wear surface of a compressor machine component. The method comprises electrolessly coating at least one wear surface of an aluminum compressor component by contacting the at least one wear surface with an electroless bath comprising nickel, phosphorous, and a wear resistant particle selected from a group consisting of: boron nitride, silicon carbide, titanium carbonitride, titanium nitride, diamond, polytetrafluoroethylene, and combinations thereof. The wear surface has a hardness of greater than or equal to about 40 to less than or equal to about 63 on a Rockwell C Hardness Scale. The aluminum compressor component having the at least one wear surface comprising the electroless surface coating is capable of withstanding at least greater than or equal to about 1,000 hours of operation in a compressor machine that processes a refrigerant comprising carbon dioxide and/or propane.
[0091] Also specifically disclosed are combinations including this method optionally with any one or any combination of more than one of the enumerated steps or features (23)-(26). The method for electrolessly coating at least one wear surface of an aluminum compressor coating optionally has any one or any combination of more than one of the following steps or features: (23) first contacting at least one wear surface to a second electroless bath comprising nickel and phosphorous to form an electroless nickel sublayer over the at least one wear surface, followed by contacting the at least one wear surface to the first electroless bath comprising nickel, phosphorous, and wear resistant particles to form the electroless surface coating over the electroless nickel sublayer; (24) further comprising heat treating by exposing the electroless surface coating to a temperature of greater than or equal to about 650.degree. F. to less than or equal to about 700.degree. F. for a duration of greater than or equal to about 1 hour, wherein after the heat treating, the electroless surface coating has a hardness of greater than or equal to about 57 to less than or equal to about 63 on a Rockwell C Hardness Scale; (25) conducting the coating of the electrolessly applied coating until the electroless surface coating has a thickness of greater than or equal to about 0.0005 inches to less than or equal to about 0.001 inches; and/or (26) the wear resistant particle comprising boron nitride and the electroless surface coating comprises greater than or equal to about 6% by weight to less than or equal to about 8% by weight of the boron nitride particle, greater than or equal to about 4% by weight to less than or equal to about 8% by weight of the phosphorous, and a balance of nickel.
