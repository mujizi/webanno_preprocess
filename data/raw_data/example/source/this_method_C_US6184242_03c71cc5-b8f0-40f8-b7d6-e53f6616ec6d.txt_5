In alternative step 1b, the compound 18 is then prepared by treating compound 19 with a chlorinating agent such as phosphorus pentachloride. The reaction can be performed neat or in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride.
The phenylamine compound of formula If is then prepared by proceeding correspondingly as in Scheme F, route (a), steps 2 and 3.
Exemplary preparation of compounds of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compounds of formula If are described in detail in Examples 11-12.
Scheme G
Scheme G describes an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 is a group represented by formula (A) and R.sup.3 is --(CH.sub.2).sub.m CONR.sup.8 R.sup.9, from the corresponding intermediate compounds of formula Ig. ##STR15##
