A reversal is also conceivable in the manner that the mating closure part is associated with the vehicle chassis and the fork latch is associated with the other lock parts of the hood.
In the invention, the charging of the force accumulator K can also be effected by the closing movement of the hood. In accordance with the embodiment shown in FIGS. 14 to 20 this can take place by the following modification which is not shown in the drawing:
The swing lever 55 has no slot 56 but acts the end by a ratchet-tooth attachment on the charging lever 58 in the region of the charging-lever arm 58". The charging lever 58 is carried along via the ratchet-tooth connection when the hood 47 is brought from its open position into the closed position, the charging lever 58 being swung in counterclockwise direction and charging the force accumulator K. Shortly before reaching the release position upon the closing of the hinged part 47, the charging lever 58 is blocked by a locking member 65. The pulling in of the mating closure part 98 is effected in the manner described in connection with the embodiment of FIGS. 14 to 20. If the remote release is now actuated by means of the grip eye 68, then, upon this process operation, another lever (not shown) must be so swung by the remote release that it lifts the swing lever 55 so that the ratchet-tooth connection comes out of engagement. In this way the charging lever 58 can assume the position shown in FIG. 18. If the remote release returns into its basic position, then the swing lever 55 is again lowered, so that ratchet-tooth engagement is again present. Upon bringing the hinged part 47 into open position, the free motion of the ratchet-tooth connection enters into action, i.e. the charging lever 58 is carried along.
The invention is not limited to swingably arranged hoods, lids or doors but can be applied for instance also to sliding doors.
The sixth embodiment, shown in FIGS. 21 to 25, is so developed that the charging of the force accumulator K is also effected by the closing movement of the hinged part 102. The latter bears at its end opposite the hinge shaft 103 a mating closure part 104 which is bent in eye-shape and cooperates with a fork latch 105. The latter is swingable around a shaft 106 of a lock housing 107. A pre-detent recess 110 and a main detent recess 111 are arranged in front of the latch fork mouth 108 which extends into a top entrance slot 109 of the lock housing 107. The fork-latch tail 112 bears a transverse pin 113 on which there acts a tension spring 114 which urges the fork latch 105 in counterclockwise direction into the open position. The other end of the tension spring 114 is fastened on a pin 115 of the lock housing 107. On the pin 115 there acts another tension spring 116 which swings in clockwise direction a locking pawl 118 which is swingable about the bearing pin 117. The locking pawl is developed as an angle lever in the manner that one lever arm 118' forms a locking tooth 119 which rests against the fork latch 105. The tension spring 116 acts on the other lever arm 118" which at its end bears a coupling pin 120. The latter passes through a short slot 121 in a transmission rod 122. The end of this transmission rod 122 which is opposite the slot 121 is coupled via a pivot pin 123 to one lever arm 124 of an angularly shaped release lever 125. A pivot bolt 126 on the lock housing side passes through the release lever 125 at its vertex. The pivot bolt 126 is at the same time the holder of a torsion spring 127 which biases the release lever 125 in clockwise direction. A stop 128 on the lock-housing side limits the spring-biased swinging motion of the release lever 125. A connecting rod 130 of a remote actuating device acts on the other lever arm 129.
