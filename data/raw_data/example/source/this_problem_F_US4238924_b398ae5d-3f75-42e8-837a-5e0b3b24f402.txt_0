When, now, any of the switches 48a, 48b, . . . is closed or opened up and accordingly any of the loads 50a, 50b, . . . is connected to or disconnected from the output terminal of the power generator 42 during operation in which the gas turbine and power generator system has been operated in steady-state conditions, there is caused a change in the amount of load on the power generator 42 so that the input shaft of the power generator 42 and accordingly the output shaft 30 of the gas turbine 20 are caused to rotate at reduced or increased speeds. The change in the revolution speed Na of the power generator input shaft is followed by a change in the magnitude of the analog output signal Sa delivered from the generator input speed detector 74 and further by a change in the output signal Sf delivered from the function generator 76. The change in the magnitude of the signal Sf supplied to one input terminal of the differential amplifier 94 in the valve actuator 92 results in a deviation in magnitude of the signal Sf from the signal Sg supplied to the other input terminal of the differential amplifier 94 and thus causes the servo motor 70b of the fuel flow control valve 70 to move the movable valve element 70a of the valve 70 until the signal Sg representative of the detected flow rate of the fuel through the control valve 70 is brought into agreement in magnitude with the signal Sf representative of the desired fuel flow rate.
When there is caused a sudden change in the amount of load on the gas turbine 20 as above described, the signal Sf representative of the new desired fuel flow rate is delivered from the function generator 76 to the valve actuator 92 immediately in response to the change in the amount of load. Since, however, the fuel flow control valve 70 inherently has a delay involved in the mechanical actions of the servo motor 70b thereof, the movable valve element 70a of the valve 70 is permitted to reach the position producing the new desired fuel flow rate with a certain time lag after the signal Sf is supplied to the valve actuator 92 in response to the change in the amount of load on the gas turbine 20. If this takes place when the amount of load on the gas turbine 20 is reduced, for example, fuel is supplied to the combustor 32 of the gas turbine 20 at a rate higher than the desired fuel flow rate optimum for the reduced amount of load on the gas turbine 20 and causes the output shaft 30 of the gas turbine to overrun the revolution speed required by the power generator 42 for the period of the above-mentioned time lag.
To obviate this problem, the fuel supply circuit 56 shown in FIG. 1 further comprises a fuel return passageway 62' leading from the tee-joint 66 between the previously described fuel feed and discharge passageways 62 and 54 to the fuel storage tank 58. The fuel return passageway 62' has provided therein a solenoid-operated two-position fuel return valve 100 operable between open and closed positions and a pressure regulator valve 102 arranged between the fuel return valve 100 and the fuel storage tank 58 for maintaining above a predetermined minimum value the pressure of the fuel to flow between the tee-joint 66 and the pressure regulator valve 102 when the fuel return valve 100 is in the open position. The fuel return valve 100 is assumed to be biased to assume the closed position and to be actuated into the open position when energized and is electrically connected to an output terminal of a load-change detecting circuit 104 which forms part of the control circuit previously mentioned. The load-change detecting circuit 104 is responsive to a sudden change in the amount of load on the gas turbine 20 and is operative to produce an output signal Sr when the amount of load on the gas turbine generator system changes. In the arrangement illustrated in FIG. 1, the load-change detecting circuit 104 is assumed to be adapted to produce the output signal Sr when the amount of load exerted on the gas turbine 20 is suddenly reduced. Such a change in the amount of load on the gas turbine 20 will take place when, for example, one or more of the loads 50a, 50b, . . . are disconnected from the output terminal of the power generator 42 with the associated one or ones of the switches 48a, 48b, . . . opened up during operation.
When the signal Sr is thus supplied to the fuel return valve 100 from the load-change detecting circuit 104, the fuel return valve 100 is energized by the signal Sr and is actuated to open for a certain short period of time (which is dictated by the rate of change of the amount of load on the gas turbine as will be understood as the description proceeds), allowing the fuel in the fuel feed passageway 62 to be partially returned to the fuel storage tank 58 by way of the fuel return passageway 62'. The flow rate of the fuel thus passed through the fuel return passageway 62' to the tank 58 is limited by means of the pressure regulator valve 102 establishing a fuel pressure higher than the above-mentioned predetermined minimum value in the fuel return passageway 62' upstream of the regulator valve 102 and accordingly in the fuel discharge passageway 54 communicating with the fuel return passageway 62' through the tee-joint 66. The pressure regulator valve 102 provided in the fuel return passageway 62' of the fuel supply circuit 56 thus serves to ensure fuel to be passed through the fuel injection valve 52 into the combustor 32 of the gas turbine 20 against a resistance imparted to the flow of the fuel in the fuel injection valve 52. The minimum fuel pressure to be established in the fuel discharge passageway 54 by the pressure regulator valve 102 is such that fuel can be injected into the combustor 32 of the gas turbine 20 at a rate which will maintain the flame in the combustor 32 without being blown out by the compressed air also injected into the combustor or preferably at a rate which is adequate not only to maintain the flame in the combustor 32 but to enable the gas turbine 20 to continue idling throughout the period of time for which the fuel return valve 100 is held open.
For the purpose of enabling the fuel supply circuit 56 to establish a steady flow of fuel in the fuel return passageway 62' as early as possible after the fuel return valve 100 has been actuated to open, it is important that the fuel return passageway 62' be branched substantially straight forward from the fuel feed passageway 62 as shown. Using the tee-joint at the junction between the fuel feed and return passageways 62 and 62' suits this purpose. If desired, however, the fuel return passageway 62' may be branched from the fuel discharge passageway 54 or from between the fuel flow control valve 70 and the tee-joint 66, though not shown in the drawings. It is apparent that the pressure regulator valve 102 may be located upstream of fuel return valve 100 or may be substituted by a flow restriction or orifice provided in the fuel return passageway 62' upstream or downstream of the fuel return valve 100.
