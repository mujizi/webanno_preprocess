[0003] Shock waves were studied from the beginning of the 20.sup.th century for military, medical and civilian applications. The use of shock waves in non-destructive applications was focused towards the middle of the century for the use in the medical field in order to destroy kidney stones from outside the body (extracorporeal treatment). These new devices were invented in Germany and they were called lithotripters. The first lithotripters used the electrohydraulic principle to produce shock waves, which is based on high voltage discharge in between two electrodes submerged in water. The high voltage discharge vaporizes the water and produces a plasma bubble that grows very fast and collapses violently, producing a shock wave that is focused via a reflector towards the desired area. The transformation of the high voltage electric energy into kinetic energy of the shock waves is efficient and proved very beneficial for different medical fields as urology, orthopedics, wound care, etc. After development and commercialization of the electrohydraulic lithotripters, new methods of producing shock waves were researched and implemented based on the electromagnetic or piezoelectric principles.
[0004] The idea of using shock waves inside the oil fields started to be incorporated in patents in the late fifties (U.S. Pat. No. 2,871,943) up to now. All these patents describe different constructions to produce seismic waves or the electrohydraulic shock waves that are generated using the high voltage discharge in between two opposing electrodes (known also as spark gap principle--see U.S. Pat. No. 4,074,758, U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,503 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,427,774 B2). The seismic shock waves are difficult to produce and have unpredictable effects on other earth structures, water beds, etc. and can generate uncontrollable environmental issues. The shock waves produced using large magnitude explosive means are also difficult to implement and control, although they produce enough energy to stimulate oil field production.
[0005] The electrohydraulic shock waves produced via spark gap electrodes, have problems with maintaining the desired distance between the two electrodes in order to be able produce persistent shock waves (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,074,758, U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,503 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,427,774 B2). The electrodes during high voltage discharge are consumed due to high heat, chemical reactions and corrosion. To address these challenges super alloys were used for the electrodes, which can prolong their life. However, the shock waves devices need to be used for days and weeks, which will require numerous exchanges of the electrodes that make this solution not feasible for field applications. Different feeding mechanisms for electrodes to offset the electrodes consumptions were employed in other patents, with complicated feeding systems and controls, which makes these systems expensive and unpractical too (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,427,774 B2).
[0006] Furthermore, a combination of electrohydraulic and electromagnetic generators that produce both acoustic vibration and electromagnetically-induced high frequency vibrations were described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,427,774 B2. The purpose of this dual method is to enhance oil stimulation by overlapping shock waves with electromagnetic waves. The electrohydraulic shock waves described in this patent are generated using spark gap electrodes as well.
[0007] Shock waves were also described of being produced using hydraulic means in U.S. Pat. No. 8,113,278 B2. However, these shock waves are radial in nature and are neither focused nor unidirectional, which reduces their efficiency.
