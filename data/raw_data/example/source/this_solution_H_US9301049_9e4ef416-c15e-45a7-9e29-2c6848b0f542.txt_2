Thus, the directionality of an N.sup.th-order differential array is the product of N first-order directional responses, which is a restatement of the pattern multiplication theorem in electroacoustics. If the .alpha..sub.i are constrained as 0.ltoreq..alpha..sub.i.ltoreq.0.5, then the directional response of the N.sup.th-order array shown in Equation (54) contains N zeros (or nulls) at angles between 90.degree..ltoreq..theta..ltoreq.180.degree.. The null locations can be calculated for the .alpha..sub.i as:
.theta..times..times..function..alpha..alpha..times..times..function..tim- es. ##EQU00032##
One possible realization of the second-order adaptive differential array variable time delays T.sub.1 and T.sub.2 is shown in FIG. 19. This solution generates any time delay less than or equal to d.sub.i/c. The computational requirements needed to realize the general delay by interpolation filtering and the resulting adaptive algorithms may be unattractive for an extremely low complexity real-time implementation. Another way to efficiently implement the adaptive differential array is to use an extension of the back-to-back cardioid configuration using a sampling rate whose sampling period is an integer multiple or divisor of the time delay for on-axis acoustic waves to propagate between the microphones, as described earlier.
FIG. 20 shows a schematic implementation of an adaptive second-order array differential microphone utilizing fixed delays and three omnidirectional microphone elements. The back-to-back cardioid arrangement for a second-order array can be implemented as shown in FIG. 20. This topology can be followed to extend the differential array to any desired order. One simplification utilized here is the assumption that the distance d.sub.1 between microphones m1 and m2 is equal to the distance d.sub.2 between microphones m2 and m3, although this is not necessary to realize the second-order differential array. This simplification does not limit the design but simplifies the design and analysis. There are some other benefits to the implementation that result by assuming that all are equal. One major benefit is the need for only one unique delay element. For digital signal processing, this delay can be realized as one sampling period, but, since fractional delays are relatively easy to implement, this advantage is not that significant. Furthermore, by setting the sampling period equal to d/c, the back-to-back cardioid microphone outputs can be formed directly. Thus, if one chooses the spacing and the sampling rates appropriately, the desired second-order directional response of the array can be formed by storing only a few sequential sample values from each channel. As previously discussed, the lowpass filter shown following the output y(t) in FIG. 20 is used to compensate the second-order .omega..sup.2 differentiator response.
