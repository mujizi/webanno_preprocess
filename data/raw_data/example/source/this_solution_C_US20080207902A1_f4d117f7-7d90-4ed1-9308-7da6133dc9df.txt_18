Example 102
2-ethyl-4-(2-ethyl-[1,3]dioxolane-2-yl)-7-methoxycarbonyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]p-yridine
[0365]The compound of Example 90 (1.50 g) was dissolved in THF (60.0 mL) in an argon atmosphere. While this solution was kept at -78.degree. C., 1.59 mol/L n-butyl lithium/n-hexane solution (4.40 mL) was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred for 0.5 hours. Subsequently, carbon dioxide was blown into the reaction mixture at -78.degree. C. for 0.5 hours and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Water was then added and the reaction mixture was extracted twice with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent gave a 7-carboxylated form as a yellow solid (1.75 g, crude). The crude carboxylated product (1.75 g, crude) was dissolved in DMF (30.0 mL). To this solution, potassium carbonate (1.25 g) and methyl iodide (0.45 mL) were added and the mixture was stirred for 13 hours at room temperature. Subsequently, water was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and purification of the residue by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=4:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow oil (1.04 g).
