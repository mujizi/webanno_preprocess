Example 349
2-ethyl-7-methoxy-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-carboxylic acid methoxymethylamide
[1089]The compound of Example 348 (11.13 g) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (505 mL) in an argon atmosphere. While this solution was chilled in an ice bath, N,O-dimethylhydroxyamine hydrochloride (6.15 g) and diethyl cyanophosphonate were added, followed by dropwise addition of triethylamine (17.5 mL). The mixture was stirred first in an ice bath for 30 min and then at room temperature for 5 hours. Subsequently, water was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification of the residue by silica gel chromatography (ethyl acetate) afforded the title compound as a brown oil (12.12 g).
