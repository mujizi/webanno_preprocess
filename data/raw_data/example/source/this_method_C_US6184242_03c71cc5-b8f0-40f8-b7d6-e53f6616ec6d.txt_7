In step 4, a thienylmethyl-nitrobenzene compound 30 is prepared by reducing the hydroxymethyl group of the compound 29 with an alkylated halosilane such as trimethylsilyl chloride, in the presence of an halide salt, e.g., sodium iodide. Suitable solvents for the reaction include aprotic solvents for example acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, and the like.
In step 5, a phenylamine compound of formula Ih is prepared by reducing the nitro group of compound 30 to an amino group. Suitable nitro group reducing conditions include nickel boride in acidic methanol, tin(II) chloride hydrate in ethanol, or catalytic hydrogenation using a platinum or palladium catalyst (e.g., PtO.sub.2 or Pd/C) in an organic solvent such as ethanol, isopropanol, or ethyl acetate.
An exemplary preparation of a compound of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compound of formula Ih is described in detail in Example 14.
Scheme I
Scheme I describes an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 is a group represented by formula (B) where X is S, and R.sup.5 is or --(CH.sub.2).sub.n Z or --(CH.sub.2).sub.m OY, in particular where m is an integer 0, from the corresponding intermediate compound of formula Ii. ##STR17##
