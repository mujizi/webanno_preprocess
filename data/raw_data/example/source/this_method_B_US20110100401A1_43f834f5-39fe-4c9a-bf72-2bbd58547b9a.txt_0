[0016] To overcome this disadvantage, further steps of inspection and selection, and measures such as washing steps are carried out on the finished containers before the filling process, and the products that are out of quality ranges follow further treatments or analysis, or are rejected, thus affecting in both cases the costs and the production time.
[0017] Furthermore, a complementary limitation to the above described cleaning operations occurs when standard containers are produced and sold closed and ready to the use. These containers, such as in particular "D-form" ampoules or RTF.RTM. syringes (Ready To Fill), are conceived for a direct filling without washing and are therefore required to meet the highest quality requirements, in particular the absolute absence of fragments and/or particles already when they exit from the first production line.
[0018] Among the drawbacks concerning the extraction step described above, this method can eliminate only one part of the fragments, leaving a remaining amount of fragments still stuck to the container. This is due, mainly, to the fact that they adhere to the inner surfaces of the tube by means of electrostatic forces that an air jet cannot overcome. Such forces are due to presence of electric charges on the fragments and/or particles at the end of the tube manufacturing steps and particularly after the cutting process.
[0019] Various systems are known for reducing or eliminating the electrostatic forces that may cause fragments to adhere to the inner surfaces of containers, by using ionized air.
[0020] US2007240784A1 and US2003115710A1 describe a method adapted to remove particles from bottles of plastics that are arranged upside-down. A jet of ionized air enters the bottles, and then a jet of normal air follows to remove the particles. This method is not suitable for glass tubes, which are long and cannot proceed vertically.
