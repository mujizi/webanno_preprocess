[0028] When an area where the film thickness is small contacts with ink for a long time, there is a large problem arises in the long-time reliability since the corrosion resistant film is dissolved and finally the base material is subjected to corrosion. Moreover, a large bend is generated due to a distribution of internal stresses caused by variation of film thickness of the organic resin film on the vibration plate, which causes a large variation in the ink injection characteristic.
[0029] Moreover, in the head in which a metallic ink resistant film is formed on the vibration plate by a sputtering method or a vapor deposition method, the covering characteristic of the corrosion resistant film is poor similar to the above-mentioned organic resin film. Depending on the location, an area in which the corrosion resistant film is formed with a very small thickness, and when ink contacts such an area for long time, the corrosion resistant film is dissolved and finally the base material is subjected to corrosion. Therefore, a long-time reliability cannot be obtained, and further a large bent is generated in the vibration plate due to fluctuation in the thickness of the metallic ink-resistant film, which causes variation in the ink injection characteristic.
[0030] Especially, this problem is serious in the electrostatic head rather than the piezoelectric head since the distance between the vibration plate and the electrode varies due to the vibration plate being bent and the drive voltage differing from the design value.
[0031] Further, in the head in which the above-mentioned corrosion resistant film is formed, the reliability of operation is low such that the vibration plate contacts the electrode due to an influence of an external environment such as humidity since the air gap between the vibration plate and the electrode is not sealed.
[0032] Moreover, in the head in which the air gap between the vibration plate and the electrode is sealed so as not to receive an influence from an external environment, there is a restriction of pH value of ink that is usable since the corrosion resistant film is not formed on the vibration plate, and, thus, matching with ink must be maintained and a cost is increased.
