[0970] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,405, "One advantage of the amide derivatives of this invention over existing antitubulin compounds in competitive binding assays results from their unique ability to bind covalently in a highly specific manner to tubulin, specifically to the beta-subunit of tubulin. (A covalent bond is a nonionic chemical bond characterized by the sharing of electrons by two atoms). In binding assays it is necessary to measure the amount of the probe which is bound to tubulin, and this generally involves separating the tubulin-bound probe from unbound probe. In the case of the amides, since binding is covalent, the tubulin-bound probe is chemically stable allowing easy separation from the unbound probe by methods such as filtration or centrifugation. This enables their use not only in assays using isolated tubulin but also in assays using whole cells, crude cell extracts, and partially purified tubulin preparations, thus obviating the need for isolated tubulin and enabling tubulin-binding assays to be carried out in many different types of cell or cell extract."
[0971] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,405, "One aspect of the present invention involves use of amide probes in binding assays to screen large numbers of compounds in order to identify those compounds with antitubulin activity using whole cells, cell extracts or isolated tubulin. For example, test compounds which bind to plant or fungal tubulin may be detected in assays using plant or fungal cells, thus providing a means of detecting antitubulin compounds with herbicidal or fungicidal activity. Similarly, amide probes may be used to detect compounds which bind to tubulin in mammalian cells or cell extracts, thus providing a means of detecting antitubulin compounds with anticancer activity."
[0972] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,405, "A second aspect of the current invention involves use of amide probes in binding assays to evaluate the sensitivity of a cell population to an antitubulin compound. For example, the current invention can be used to evaluate the sensitivity of a tumor cell population to an antitubulin drug such as paclitaxel, vincristine or vinblastine, thus providing a means of predicting drug sensitivity of a patient's tumor at the time of diagnosis or relapse using cells isolated by biopsy, and consequently guiding selection of the optimal chemotherapy regimen. Frequently, treatment of neoplasms with a particular antitubulin drug results in resistance development due to a reduced accumulation of drug in the cell. The current invention also provides a method for determining sensitivity of such resistant cells to antitubulin drugs. Various types of in vitro drug sensitivity tests have been used to select drugs more likely to be effective against tumor cells of a particular patient prior to their in vivo application {Cortazar, P. et al., Clinical Cancer Research, 3, 741-747 (1997), Arps, H. et al., Int. J. Immunotherapy, III, 229-235 (1987)}. Such assays typically involve cell culture of the isolated tumor cells or xenotransplantation using transplant-bearing mice, and require several days to multiple weeks to obtain results. In the current invention, the sensitivity of isolated tumor cells to antitubulin drugs can be determined by measuring the ability of said antitubulin drugs to influence binding of an amide probe to the cells, cell extracts or isolated tubulin. Since this method does not require culture of the isolated cells, it can provide sensitivity data within a few hours allowing drug sensitivity to be determined more rapidly."
[0973] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,405, "A third aspect of the present invention involves another approach to the use of amide probes in binding assays to evaluate sensitivity of eukaryotic cells to pesticides or drugs which act by binding to tubulin. Specifically, this approach is useful in resistance monitoring for antitubulin pesticides or drugs to detect cells which show altered sensitivity to said antitubulin pesticides or drugs due to modifications in tubulin. Resistance to antitubulin compounds due to modifications in tubulin have occurred in fungal pathogens {Davidse, L. C. and Ishi, H. in "Modem Selective Fungicides", ed. by H. Lyr, 305-322 (1995)}, algae {James, S. W. et al., Journal of Cell Science, 106, 209-218 (1993)} and helminths {Beech, R. N. et al., Genetics, 138, 103-110 (1994)}. Resistant cells containing modified tubulin may show a difference in binding affinity for amides, allowing amide probes to be used in binding assays to detect such mutants. Such an assay can be carried out by comparing the rate of binding of an amide probe to cells or extracts of cells previously exposed to the antitubulin pesticide or drug with the rate of binding to untreated control cells or cell extracts."
[0974] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,405, "For example, benzimidazole and thiophanate fungicides such as benomyl (methyl 1-(butylcarbamoyl)benzimidazol-2-ylcarbamate), fuberidazole (2-(2'-furyl)benzimidazole), thiabendazole (2-(4-thiazolyl)benzimidazole)- , carbendazim (methyl benzimidazol-2-ylcarbamate), thiophanate-methyl (1,2-bis(3-methoxycarbonyl-2-thioureido)benzene, and thiophanate (1,2-bis(3-ethoxycarbonyl-2-thioureido)benzene are known in the art for use against plant pathogenic fungi. However, the use of benzimidazole and thiophanate fungicides over a period of time can result in the development of fungal strains having reduced sensitivity to these fungicides, whereby the fungicides are much less effective in controlling a particular fungal disease. Such "resistant" fungi when isolated as pure cultures typically are from 10-fold to >1,000-fold less sensitive to benzimidazoles and thiophanates than fungi from locations which have not been exposed to these fungicides. Moreover, fungi which develop reduced sensitivity to one benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicide frequently also show reduced sensitivity to other benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicides. The N-phenylcarbamate fungicide diethofencarb is used commercially to control benzimidazole-resistant fungi such as Botrytis cinerea. However, its use has led to the development of fungal strains resistant to both benzimidazoles and diethofencarb. Current methods to detect fungal strains resistant to benzimidazoles, thiophanates or diethofencarb are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Some methods involve isolation of pure test cultures followed by in vitro assays of mycelial growth using fungicide-amended agar plates, or in vivo assays involving fungicide-treated leaves. Alternatively, slide germination tests of spores may be carried out in the presence of fungicide. Fungal strains which are resistant to diethofencarb and/or benzimidazoles and thiophanates typically contain modified tubulin proteins {see for example, Koenraadt, H. et al., Phytopathology, 82, 1348-1354 (1992) and Yarden, O. and Katan, T., Phytopathology, 83, 1478-1483 (1993)}. Benzimidazole-resistant, diethofencarb-sensitive fungal strains typically show enhanced sensitivity to amide derivatives of the present invention, whereas benzimidazole-resistant, diethofencarb-resistant fungal strains typically show reduced sensitivity. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that amide probes can be used in binding assays to differentiate benzimidazole-resistant, diethofencarb-sensitive fungal strains which show enhanced ability to bind amide probes in assays using whole cells or cell extracts, or benzimidazole-resistant, diethofencarb-resistant fungal strains which show reduced ability to bind amide probes, from strains which are not resistant. Such assays may be less labor-intensive and time-consuming, and may also provide information as to whether the resistance mechanism involves a change in tubulin. Information about the mechanism of resistance may be useful in designing a resistance management strategy."
