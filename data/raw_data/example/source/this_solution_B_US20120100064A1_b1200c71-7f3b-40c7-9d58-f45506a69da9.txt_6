[0151] Next, a first coating liquid containing spherical .di-elect cons.-Al.sub.0.5Fe.sub.1.5O.sub.3 particles and second to fourth coating liquids containing three kinds of rod-like .di-elect cons.-Fe.sub.2O.sub.3 particles with different aspect ratios were produced. An explanation will be given of the first to fourth coating liquids at first in detail, and respective magnetic characteristics of the first to fourth coating liquids will be explained next.
(3-5-1) First Coating Liquid
[0152] More specifically, regarding the first coating liquid, an .di-elect cons.-Al.sub.0.42Fe.sub.1.5O.sub.3 water slurry was produced based on "(3-4-1) Production of Magnetic Material Slurry Containing Spherical .di-elect cons.-Al.sub.0.5Fe.sub.1.5O.sub.3 particles", an .di-elect cons.-Al.sub.0.5Fe.sub.1.5O.sub.3 slurry water slurry of a predetermined amount and a PEG 500000 aqueous solution of a predetermined amount were mixed together at a predetermined ratio by weight. Water was added in this solution, and the addition of water was terminated when the coating liquid viscosity became 170 cP, thereby taking this solution as the first coating liquid.
[0153] When images of the magnetic particles contained in the first coating liquid were picked up by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a TEM image shown in FIG. 9A was obtained. Based on this TEM image, it was confirmed that the first coating liquid contained substantially spherical E-Al.sub.0.5Fe.sub.1.5O.sub.3 particles 21 having an aspect ratio of 1.1.
