[0093] Alternatively, the double-sided polycrystalline compacts of the present invention can be attached to an additional substrate 40, as shown in FIG. 10A. FIG. 10A illustrates a drill bit having two polycrystalline layers 14 and 16. FIG. 10B illustrates a drill bit produced by conventional methods having a single polycrystalline layer 42. The substrate layers 12 and 40 shown in FIG. 10A can be formed simultaneously with the polycrystalline layers 14 and 16. For example, a cup assembly can be formed by placing layers of superabrasive and substrate materials as either solid or powder to form a precursor assembly. The assembly can then be subjected to HPHT conditions. Alternatively, each layer can be formed in separate steps and the substrate 40 can be attached as discussed above.
[0094] Extending the effective thickness of the polycrystalline layers in accordance with the principles of the present invention allows production of polycrystalline tools having a thickness or effective thickness greater than about 1.6 mm to about 2 mm, without regard to superabrasive particle size. An additional benefit of the polycrystalline compacts and inserts of the present invention includes extended tool life. Specifically, traditional PCD and PCBN inserts are single sided and can be attached to a tool body. Upon wear of the polycrystalline surface the insert is typically removed and replaced. The polycrystalline compacts and inserts of the present invention include at least two abrading or cutting surfaces, thus at least doubling the useful life the tool. Further, having polycrystalline superabrasive on two opposing edges of the compact or insert allows for applications such as reversible cutting and abrading, and other applications made possible by having a double-sided PCD/PCBN which are difficult or not possible using traditional single sided compacts.
[0095] The polycrystalline layers of the present invention can be joined to one another or to a substrate using a HPHT welding process in order to manufacture the various embodiments of the present invention. The HPHT welding process is a method, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, of joining two surfaces, at least one of which can be a polycrystalline layer. As an illustration of this process, a polycrystalline layer and a substrate can be joined as described below. A substrate can be provided having a contact surface. The substrate can be formed as described above in connection with other embodiments of the present invention. The contact surface can be any surface, or portion of a surface, of the substrate which is configured to be joined to a polycrystalline layer. Generally, this contact surface is a flat surface, however contoured and shaped surfaces can also be suitable for use in the HPHT welding process of the present invention. At least one polycrystalline layer can also be provided having a surface configured for joining to the contact surface. The polycrystalline layer can be a solid PCD or PCBN or can be a layered polycrystalline article such as a double-sided compact, described previously, or a sandwich segment, described below. These polycrystalline layers are preferably HPHT sintered products produced in a prior separate step.
[0096] One or both of the polycrystalline surfaces and the substrate contact surfaces can be coated with a coupling agent. The coupling agent can be any material capable of acting as a sintering aid under HPHT conditions. Suitable coupling agents can include, without limitation, cobalt, titanium, nickel, manganese, iron, silicon, aluminum, vanadium, chromium, zirconium, molybdenum, tungsten, tantalum, and alloys thereof. Currently preferred coupling agents include cobalt and titanium. Titanium and several other coupling agents such as tantalum, aluminum, zirconium, silicon, and alloys of these metals can act as both carbide and nitride formers. Coating of the coupling agent can be performed by a wide variety of processes. Several suitable coating processes include, but are not limited to, sputtering, electrodeposition, electroless deposition, spot-welding, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, coating of the coupling agent can be performed by sputtering. The coating can be applied at various thicknesses depending on the final tool desired. However, the coating typically can have a thickness of from about 1 .mu.m to about 0.5 mm, and preferably from about 3 .mu.m to about 20 .mu.m. One consideration in determining an appropriate thickness for the coating layer is that a thinner layer can result in a more uniform boundary in the final tool from one joined layer to an adjacent layer. Further, extremely thick layers may result in a multi-layer polycrystalline article having excess coupling agent. The presence of excess coupling agent or excessive amounts of metal binder can weaken the final article at high operating temperatures.
[0097] After the coating is formed on either or both of the surfaces to be joined, the surfaces can be placed in contact with one another in a predetermined orientation to form a polycrystalline precursor. The polycrystalline precursor can then be placed in a HPHT apparatus and subjected to high pressure and high temperature sufficient to bond surfaces having a coupling agent coated therebetween. During this HPHT welding process the coupling agent acts to sinter adjacent layers together. As mentioned in connection with previous discussions of HPHT processes, typical temperatures can range from about 1,200.degree. C. to about 1,500.degree. C. and pressures can range from about 1 GPa to about 7 GPa, although conditions outside these ranges can be used.
