In this example, half the icon patterns the icon image 610, and half of them are the icon image 611. Ideally these two patterns would be relatively uniformly distributed among the icon zones. All of the elements of these patterns are depicted as being of substantially equal and uniform color density. In isolation these two patterns do not clearly suggest the form of the final image, and this can be used as a security element--the image is not obvious until it is formed by the overlying lens array. One instance of the synthetic image 612 formed by the combination of the synthetic image of icon elements 610 with the synthetic image of icon elements 611 is shown, whereby the gaps that remain between the separate synthetic images form the numeral "10". In this case, two synthetic images are combined to form the final synthetic image, so the colored parts of this image 613 show 50% color density. This method is not limited by the details of this example: three icons could have been used instead of two, the gaps defining the desired element in the composite synthetic images can have variable widths and unlimited shape variety, and this method can be combined with either the methods of FIGS. 23, 24a,b or 25, or an other icon image design method we have taught.
Covert, hidden information can be incorporated into the icon images that cannot be seen in the resulting synthetic images. Having such covert information hidden in the icon images can be used, for example, for covert authentication of an object. Two methods for accomplishing this are illustrated by FIG. 25. The first method is illustrated by the use of matched icon images 616 and 618. Icon image 616 shows a solid border pattern and the number "42" contained inside of the border. Icon image 618 shows a solid shape with the number "42" as a graphical hole in that shape. In this example, the perimeter shapes of icon images 616 and 618 are substantially identical and their relative position within their respective icon zones, 634 and 636, are also substantially identical. When a composite synthetic image 620 is created from these icon images, the border of the composite synthetic image 622 will show 100% color density because all icon images have a pattern in that corresponding area, so there is full overlap in the synthetic images created from icon images 616 and 618. The color density of the interior 624 of the composite synthetic image 620 will be 50%, since the image of the space surrounding the "42" comes from icon images 618 that only fill half the icon zones, and the image of the colored "42" comes from icon images 616 that also fill half the icon zones. Consequently, there is no tonal differentiation between the "42" and its background, so the observed composite synthetic image 626 will show an image having a 100% color density border 628 and a 50% color density interior 630. The "42" covertly present in all of the icon images 616 and 618 is thereby "neutralized" and will not be seen in the observed composite synthetic image 626.
A second method for incorporating covert information into icon images is illustrated by triangles 632 in FIG. 25. Triangles 632 may be randomly placed within the icon zones (not shown in this figure) or they can be placed in an array or other pattern that does not substantially match the period of the icon zones 634, 632. Synthetic images are created from a multiplicity of regularly arrayed icon images that are imaged by a corresponding regular array of micro-lenses. Patterns in the icon plane that do not substantially correspond to the period of the micro-lens array will not form complete synthetic images. The pattern of triangles 632 therefore will not create a coherent synthetic image and will not be visible in the observed synthetic image 626. This method is not limited to simple geometric designs, such as triangles 632: other covert information, such as alpha-numeric information, bar codes, data bits, and large-scale patterns can be incorporated into the icon plane with this method.
FIG. 26 illustrates a general approach to creating fully three dimensional integral images in a Unison material (Unison 3-D). A single icon zone 640 contains icon image 642 that represents a scale-distorted view of an object to be displayed in 3-D as seen from the vantage point of that icon zone 640. In this case the icon image 642 is designed to form a synthetic image 670 of a hollow cube 674. Icon image 642 has a foreground frame 644 that represents the nearest side 674 of hollow cube 672, tapered gap patterns 646 that represent the corners 676 of the hollow cube 672, and a background frame 648 that represents the farthest side 678 of the hollow cube 672. It can be seen that the relative proportions of the foreground frame 644 and the background frame 648 in the icon image 642 do not correspond to the proportions of the nearest side 674 and the farthest side 678 of the synthetic image hollow cube 672. The reason for the difference in scale is that images that are to appear further from the plane of the Unison material experience greater magnification, so their size in the icon image must be reduced in order to provide the correct scale upon magnification to form the synthetic image 672.
At a different location on the Unison 3-D material we find icon zone 650 that includes a different icon image 652. As with icon image 642, icon image 652 represents a scale-distorted view of the synthetic image 672 as seen from the different vantage point of this icon zone 650. The relative scaling of foreground frame 654 and background frame 658 are similar to the corresponding elements of icon image 642 (although this will not be true, in general), but the position of the background frame 658 has shifted, along with the size and orientation of the corner patterns 656. Icon zone 660 is located a further distance away on the Unison 3-D material and it presents yet another scale-distorted icon image 662, including icon image 662 with foreground frame 664, tapered gap patterns 667, and background frame 668.
