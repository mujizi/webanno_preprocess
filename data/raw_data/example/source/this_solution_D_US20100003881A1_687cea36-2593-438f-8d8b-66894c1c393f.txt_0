[0019] Whatever width of narrow fiber tow 72 is generated from the fibrous fabric of large fiber tow 50, the next step is to form weaves or braids from these narrow fiber tows 72 in the conventional manner. If desired, the melt-bonded material 60 or thermoplastic may be removed after weaving or braiding by the use of suitable solvents or heat. If heat treatment is used such that the fiber sizing is removed or degraded, conventional means for applying fiber finishes such as passing through a coating bath or dipping may be used to reconstitute any desired sizing.
[0020] The result of slicing the fibrous fabric of large fiber tow 50 of FIG. 2 into multiple narrow tows 72 is continuous, low-cost fibers that are suitable for weaving and braiding. Interstitial toughening via melt-bonding to can be imparted into resulting braided fabrics, which is not possible using currently existing methods via the melt-bonding thermoplastic. This melt-bond material may be fugitive, if undesired, after formation of woven or braided fabric.
[0021] The described embodiments allow for the fabrication of narrow fiber tow weaves and braids from low-cost materials (a large fiber tow) with no loss in performance. In certain cases, this fabrication method results in an improved performance due to smaller interstitial spaces between the braids of the narrow fiber tows. These smaller spaces reduce the tendency for microcracking. Additional improvements in performance are provided through interlayer toughening to a braided fabric from the melt-bonding thermoplastic. One current solution is to use commercially available small-fiber tows to reduce interstitial spacing between tows, but this solution is a high-cost solution. Currently, no method exists for introducing interlayer-based toughening into braided fabrics fabricated from large fiber tows. However, the above-described embodiments are lower in cost while still providing interlayer toughening to the braids.
[0022] The above-described embodiments include the use of large fiber tow 50, slit into the above-described narrow fiber tows 72, to form composite parts that have the quality of parts made from smaller fiber tows. The fiber tows 50 described herein are generally fabricated from carbon fibers, but other fiber types are contemplated. The large fiber tows 50 described herein are flattened, melt-bonded into a relatively wide fabric and then separated, by slitting the fabric, into narrower components, referred to herein as narrow fiber tows, resulting in a method of fabricating a composite structure. Flattening the large fiber tows includes arranging the individual fibers of the large fiber tow so they are positioned substantially flat, with the individual fibers substantially adjacent to one another and maintaining this positioning through a melt-bonding process before the material is slit, or sliced, into the multiple narrow tows. The resultant narrow fiber tows may then be utilized, in conjunction with appropriate tooling, in the formation of a composite part. Costs are reduced as the more-cost-efficient large-fiber tows are separated into multiple narrow fiber tows which allows users to maintain the quality of using small fiber tows without the increased cost of off-the-shelf small fiber tows.
[0023] The described embodiments provide methods for production of toughened, braided or woven products that result in an advantage to a manufacturer as the process results in lowers costs and possibly increased performance over contemporary, preformed composite structures. This benefit is imparted when the melt-bonding material use to hold the large fiber tows together is compatible with the matrix resin that is subsequently used to infuse a preform made from fabrics based on the above-described narrow tow fibers and then processed to form a composite part provided that the melt-bondable material and the matrix work together to suppress damage when the cured part is subjected to impact.
