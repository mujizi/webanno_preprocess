[0224]Although not explicitly shown, the radio network controller 104 also adds L2 to the semi-active set and issues an Active Set Update 716 for adding cell L2 to the terminal 101a at the time when the radio network controller 104 receives the tunnel setup notification 715 from the second WLAN gateway 105b. Thus, the active set will contain M1 and the semi-active set will contain M2, L1 and L2. The state of the terminal information management section 202 of the radio network controller 104 at this time point is shown in state (b) of FIG. 8 and the state of information held by the terminal 101a is shown in state (b) of FIG. 6.
[0225]A process performed by the nodes after the terminal 101a enters cell L1 and becomes terminal 101b will be described below with reference to a process sequence shown in FIG. 11. It is assumed here that the terminal 101a is in a condition unsuitable for communication at first since the radio signal strength is unstable immediately after the terminal 101a enters cell L1, and then the radio signal strength increases, the communication error rates decrease, and a condition in which stable communication can be performed is reached.
[0226]The section from the entry into cell L1 1101 to the downlink data transmission 1104 is a process in which packets sent from a public packet-switched network 112 to the terminal 101b is transferred from the packet data gateway 108 to the first WLAN gateway 105a immediately after the terminal 101b enters the cell L1. This process reduces the time of discontinuity between establishment of connection between the terminal 101b and the first WLAN access network 103a in cell L1 after stabilization of communication and reception of a downlink packet at the terminal 101b.
[0227]The terminal 101b moves into the area covered by the first WLAN access network 103a (1101). The first WLAN access network 103a detects the radio field of a wireless LAN on the terminal 101b. While the radio signal strength is unstable, the terminal 101b issues Probe defined in specification 802.11 or outputs Association on receipt of a beacon from the first WLAN access network 103a, thereby notifying the MAC address of the terminal 101b to the first WLAN access network 103a. Accordingly, depending on circumstances, the following procedure and a communication start procedure, which will be described later, may be initiated at about the same time in response to the first Association issued by the terminal 101b when communication condition is stabilized.
[0228]If the area covered by the wireless LAN overlaps the area covered by another wireless LAN and terminal communicates a WLAN access network other than the first WLAN access network 103a, the first WLAN access network 103a can detect the MAC address of the terminal 101b by receiving frames being communicated.
