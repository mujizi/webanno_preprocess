Synthesis of [4-Amino-5-(4-fluorophenylcarbamoyl)pyrimidin-2-ylsulfanyl]acetic acid ethyl ester
A. Potassium-4-amino-2-tritylsulfanylpyrimidine-5-carboxylate
Solid portions of Na.sub.2CO.sub.3 (3.7 g, 25 mmol) followed by triphenylmethylchloride (6.4 g, 23 mmol) were added, at ambient temperature, to a stirred solution of ethyl-4-amino-2-mercapto-pyrimidine-5-carboxylate (Lancaster; 5.0 g, 25 mmol) in DMSO (100 mL). After 30 min, the resulting suspension was diluted with H.sub.2O (500 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (5.times.100 mL). The combined organic extract was washed with H.sub.2O (2.times.100 mL), dried using Na.sub.2SO.sub.4 and diluted with THF (100 mL). Solid KOTMS (90% tech., 7.4 g, 60 mmol) was immediately added to this solution of crude trityl protected sulfide and the resulting yellow suspension was stirred at reflux (1 h). After allowing to cool to ambient temperature, the resulting voluminous white solids were collected by filtration, washed with dichloromethane and dried in vacuo to afford the titled compound (8.0 g, 18 mmol, 78% yield): .sup.1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d.sub.6) .delta. 7.95 (s, 1H), 7.29 7.13 (m, 18H).
B. 4-Amino-2-mercaptopyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid (4-fluorophenyl)amide
Solid portions of potassium-4-amino-2-tritylsulfanylpyrimidine-5-carboxylate (46 g, 10 mmol) followed by HATU (39 g, 0.10 mol) were added, at ambient temperature, to a solution of 4-fluoroaniline (11 g, 0.10 mol) and NMM (31 g, 0.30 mol) in NMP (500 mL). After stirring for 12 hours, the resulting orange solution was poured into water (1000 mL) and the oily, solid precipitant was collected, dissolved in dichloromethane (500 mL), and diluted with acetic acid (50 mL). The resulting solution was stirred (ambient temperature, 3 h), then concentrated in vacuo (to about 150 mL total volume) and diluted with diethyl ether (100 mL). The resulting yellow solid was collected, washed with dichloromethane and dried in vacuo to afford the titled compound (13 g, 49 mmol, 49% yield). .sup.1H NMR (300 MHz, CD.sub.3OD) .delta. 8.20 (s, 1H), 7.58 (dd, J=9.3, 4.8 Hz, 2H), 7.07 (app. t, J=9.0 Hz, 2H); MS (+APCI) m/z 265 (MH+, 100).
