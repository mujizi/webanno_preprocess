[0224] FIG. 26B is a method 750 of operating a DVD player, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Method 750 may for example start from block 730 in FIG. 26A. In block 752, the DVD menu is presented after stopping the movie. Thereafter, in block 754, a determination is made as to whether or not the menu button on the remote control is pressed. If pressed, the method proceeds to block 758 where the DVD feature menu and DVD menu are integrated and presented. If not pressed, the method proceeds to block 756 where a determination is made as to whether or not a DVD play control has been selected/activated. If so, the method proceeds to block 770 where the movie resumes playing at the last marked location. If not, the method proceeds back to block 752.
[0225] Following block 758, the method proceeds to block 760 where a determination is made as to whether or not the menu button has been pressed. If pressed, the method proceeds to block 762 where the main menu is presented. Thereafter in block 764 a determination is made as to whether or not a DVD feature has been selected/activated. If so, the method proceeds back to block 758. If not, the method proceeds back to block 762. If the menu button is not pressed in block 760, the method proceeds to block 766 where a determination is made as to whether or not a DVD play control has been selected/activated. If so, the method proceeds to block 770 where the movie resumes playing at the last marked location. If not, the method proceeds back to block 752. If not, the method proceeds to block 768 where a determination is made as to whether or not the DVD menu has been selected. If so, the method proceeds to block 752. If not, the method proceeds back to block 758.
[0226] As should be appreciated, as shown by this method, the virtual chapter is retained in all the various menus. This includes the other media feature menus. The user therefore can resume playing the movie even if they exit the DVD menus and enter the music, photo or video menus.
