In operation, fluid transfer apparatus 20 prevents fatigue of an operators hands due to the automatic depression and extension of plunger 25 by drive assembly 63. Furthermore, since the operator need not touch plunger shaft 33, an entire batch of fluids may be transferred by a single syringe, thereby reducing cost and maintaining aseptic conditions.
As has been herein previously indicated, fluid transfer apparatus 20 is used in conjunction with a selected needle having a selected size, and/or other attachments typical of the application such as tube sets, filters, and the like, of which will be readily understood by those having ordinary skill in the art. Because of the variety of attachments that may be employed with fluid transfer apparatus 20, and due to the fact that many different fluids may also be used having varying viscosity's and flow characteristics, fluid transfer apparatus 20 is provided with an internal safeguard operative for preventing high internal fluid pressure within syringe 24 during either a fill or dispense movement. It will be readily apparent to those having ordinary skill, that such a safeguard is desirable because high internal fluid within a syringe can cause not only damage to an attachment, but may also lead to denigration of the fluid being transferred into and out of the syringe. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide adequate motor 71 dispense speed, i.e., flow rate, with large orifice attachments, while avoiding unacceptably high internal fluid pressure within syringe 24 with small-orifice attachments or high-resistant filters.
Accordingly, in order to solve this problem of providing adequate flow rate without causing damage to the attachments or to the fluid, microcontroller 160 utilizes current sensing as an indirect measure of internal fluid pressure within syringe 24. With respect to the instant application, of which will be understood to those having ordinary skill in the art, motor 71 speed is proportional to voltage, and motor 71 torque is proportional to electric current. As motor 71 torque increases, the amount of electric current consumed by motor 71 also increases. Furthermore, motor 71 torque corresponds directly with plunger 25 driving force, the driving force of plunger 25 thereby determining internal fluid pressure or vacuum within syringe 24 during a dispense or fill movement respectively. In other words, the internal fluid pressure within syringe 24 is directly proportional to plunger 25 driving force, which is the product of motor 71 torque. However, it will be understood by those having ordinary skill that as motor 71 speed increases, motor 71 torque decreases. Thus, at a given voltage, motor 71 torque and the electric current consumed by motor 71 increase directly in proportion to load. Yet, as motor 71 speed increases, motor 71 torque declines, and as motor 71 speed is reduced through greater load, motor 71 torque increases in proportion. When flow is restricted due to the characteristics of the attachment and/or the characteristics of a selected fluid/solution, motor 71 slows down while motor 71 torque and current consumption increase. At some point during a given fill or dispense movement, a balance is achieved in the fluid transfer apparatus 20 wherein motor 71 torque, motor 71 speed, current consumption, and the flow rate of the fluid are in equilibrium. However, at this equilibrium state, the internal fluid pressure within syringe 24 may be too high.
Accordingly, current sensor 163A operates as a sensor means for sensing the current consumption of motor 71 and communicating the current consumption information to microcontroller 160 in the form of a "current sense" signal, although other sensor means may be suitably employed. Thus, during a dispense operation, when the rate of current consumption by motor 71 exceeds a predetermined value as sensed by current sensor 163A, which in the instant application would be the dispense current-limit defined as the rate of current consumption proportional to either the maximum allowable pressure of a specific attachment, or the maximum allowable internal fluid pressure allowable by whatever fluid is being dispensed from syringe 24, whichever is lower, microcontroller 160 then limits that amount of current delivered to motor 71 through full driver bridge 163, regardless of how much the operator depresses pivoting trigger 133, thereby controlling the speed of plunger 25 as it travels through barrel 27 during a dispense movement. Therefore, fluid transfer apparatus 20 allows the operator to control motor 71 speed with low flow-resistant attachments through the use of pivoting trigger 133 and switch 132, yet with high flow-resistant attachments, automatically limits internal fluid pressure within syringe 24 for inhibiting damage to the attachment and for further inhibiting damage to the fluid/solution.
Consistent with the foregoing, during a fill operation, plunger 25 is retracted or extended in order to create a vacuum within barrel 27. If plunger 25 is retracted too rapidly, air may be drawn past piston 31 and into that portion of barrel 27 where fluid resides, thereby resulting in inaccurate intakes of fluid. Current sensor 163A may be configured to sense current consumption during fill operations. Thus, during a fill operation, when the rate of current consumption by motor 71 exceeds a predetermined value as sensed by current sensor 163A, which in the instant application would be the rate of current consumption proportional the maximum vacuum allowable within barrel 27, or the fill current-limit, microcontroller 160 then limits that amount of current delivered to motor 71 through full driver bridge 163, regardless of how much the operator depresses pivoting trigger 133, thereby controlling the speed of plunger 25 as it travels through barrel 27 during a fill movement. Therefore, fluid transfer apparatus 20 allows the operator to control motor 71 speed through the use of pivoting trigger 133 and switch 132, yet with high flow-resistant attachments, automatically limits the internal vacuum within syringe 24. With respect to the instant invention, normally the fill current-limit is set at roughly half the dispense current-limit.
