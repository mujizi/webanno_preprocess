BRIEF SUMMARY
[0007] The present invention aims in particular to allow a smaller dimensioning of the acoustic shroud of such a propulsion unit, in order to save weight.
[0008] This aim of the invention is achieved with a propulsion unit for an aircraft, comprising: [0009]a fan comprising a fan case whereof the inner wall includes a coating whereof the upstream edge is set back in relation to the upstream edge of said case, and [0010]an air intake assembly comprising an air intake structure comprising an air intake lip and an acoustic shroud extending between said air intake lip and the upstream edge of said coating. [0011]remarkable in that said shroud is connected to said case by simple nesting inside this case, this method possibly being supplemented by discrete means of connection between these two elements.
[0012] In the context of the present invention, "periodic means" designates fastening members such as screws distributed discretely on the periphery of the acoustic shroud or deformable support beams as taught by patent application FR08/00471 filed by the applicant on Jan. 29, 2008.
[0013] Due to the simple nesting connection, possibly completed by periodic connecting means, it is no longer necessary to provide a fastening flange of the acoustic shroud on the fan case, as was the case in the prior art: the elimination of this flange constitutes a first source of weight savings in itself.
