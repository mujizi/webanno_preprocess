[0105] The neurotransmitter specific coating is prepared by diazotizing 1.5 mg of a stock 5.0.times.10.sup.-3 M solution of the 0507 tether (Corcoran Research Group, University of Wyoming) (as the stable amine) in a 1-dram screw top vial. Nine hundred (900) .mu.L of absolute ethanol purchased from Aldrich and 100 .mu.L of p-toluene sulfonic acid solution (PTSA, 100 mg/mL in absolute ethanol) is added to the 1.5 mg of the 0507 tether. This solution is stirred with a micro-stir bar in an ice bath in a refrigerator at 0.degree. C. for 30 minutes. To form a diazonium, 2 .mu.L of butyl nitrite is added to the reaction mixture and stirred for an additional 30 minutes. If stored below 0.degree. C., this stock solution of diazotized tether can last for 2-3 days. A yellow or rose color indicates the solution is no longer active. The 0507 tether solution is further diluted to 1.0.times.10.sup.-4 M with Millipore water for use in experiments. The addition of water also reduces the appearance of ethanol peaks in the Raman spectra. The characteristic peaks of the 0507 tether are identified in the Raman spectrum from a blank consisting of 100 .mu.L of the 0507 tether and 900 .mu.L of silver-coated, paramagnetic nanoparticle colloid.
[0106] The next step is to determine the reactivity of serotonin with the 0507 tether and determine a detection limit. A 1.0.times.10.sup.-3 M stock solution of serotonin is prepared with 2.1 mg of serotonin (Aldrich) diluted with 10 mL of 1.0 M Dulbecco's phosphate buffer (Aldrich). Subsequent dilutions ranging in concentration from 1.0.times.10.sup.-4 M to 1.0.times.10.sup.-10 M are made in 1-dram vials and diluted with the Dulbecco's buffer. A 0.1 M solution of sodium borohydride is used to reduce the excess diazonium back to the amine. This form cannot react with itself to form an interfering dye. The solution of sodium borohydride is made by dissolving 3.7 mg of sodium borohydride in 1 mL of 0.5 M sodium hydroxide solution. The borohydride is important as the unreacted 0507 tether can constitute an interference in the assays. By allowing the 0507 tether to react with the serotonin and subsequently adding the borohydride, the excess diazonium is reduced back to the unreactive amine form.
[0107] Five hundred (500) .mu.L of each of the 1.0.times.10.sup.-4 M 0507 tether solution and the serotonin solution, of the different concentrations, are added together in 1-dram vial. An amount of sodium borohydride equal to 1% of the total volume of the solution is then added (10 .mu.L). This is the reaction mixture. In this solution, a reaction between the 0507 tether and analyte occurs and the excess diazonium is converted back to the unreactive amine form. Ten 100 .mu.L samples are created by a serial dilution of this solution in order to provide a concentration range one order of magnitude lower than the original concentration of reaction mixture. To each 100 .mu.L sample, 300 .mu.L of the colloid is added and placed on a vortex for three seconds. This vial is placed into a Raman spectrometer (e.g., a Delta Nu Advantage 200A Raman instrument). A Raman spectrum indicative of the seratonin is acquired within an average of 5-1 second acquisitions.
[0108] ECF cerebral samples are collected from living rats by inserting microdialysis probes into the rats' brains. Probe positions on the rats' heads corresponding to the desired region of the brain are located and small holes are drilled into their skulls. Perfusion cannulae are inserted into these holes and dialysate is pushed through the cannulae for four days to remove blood due to the surgery. These samples are analyzed in the same prepared manner as the standards, however, in smaller volumes due to the low volume produced in experiments. The lower volumes may require a scaling down of the volumes used in the standard procedure. Five (5) .mu.L of the dialysate is added to 5 .mu.L of the 1.0.times.10.sup.-4 M 0507 tether in a microtiter plate well. Sixty (60) .mu.L of colloid is added to the reaction mixture. The sample is placed into a capillary tube in order to accommodate the small sample volume. The capillary sample is placed into the capillary tube adapter for the Raman spectroscopy instrument.
[0109] Grams 32 and PLSIQ algorithms (Thermo-Galactic) are used to determine the correlation between the spectral features and the concentration of serotonin in ECF samples. The wavelength range best suited for serotonin between 1390 to 1450 cm.sup.-1. FIG. 26 shows the correlation between actual serotonin concentrations and predicted concentrations. At a concentration of 1.0.times.10.sup.-9 M serotonin, the R.sup.2, or determination value, in the model was 0.9756 and the detection limit was 1.00.times.10.sup.-10 M (3.times. signal to noise). FIG. 27 depicts several spectra of the 0507 tether reacted with serotonin in the ECF (notated as CSF Samples 1-3) along with a 1.times.10.sup.-6 M serotonin/tether spectrum in a buffered solution to show the correlation between ECF samples and a control. The peaks of interest can still be seen in the ECF samples and thus the concentration of serotonin level can be determined by the PLS algorithm.
