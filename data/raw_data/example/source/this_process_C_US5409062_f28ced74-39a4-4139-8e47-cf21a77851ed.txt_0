In the production of hydrocarbons from subterranean reservoirs, the deposition of solid salts, or scale on surfaces, down hole tubing and equipment is a major production problem. The problem increases as the water-cut in the produced fluid increases. Scales are slightly soluble inorganic salts, such as calcium or barium sulfates or calcium carbonate, etc. These minerals are often found in the produced water of hydrocarbon recovery operations. Inhibition of scale formation is significantly more cost effective than a well cleanout and especially so when a threshold chemical treatment is used. Wells can be treated with scale inhibiting chemicals either as a batch job, with continuous treatment down the annulus or through a feed string, or by a squeeze treatment. A squeeze treatment is a common oil field practice for treating subterranean formations to inhibit scale formation. In a squeeze treatment, a scale inhibitor treatment is injected or squeezed into the reservoir formation. The scale inhibitor forced into the formation is either absorbed by the reservoir mineral, becomes phase trapped or precipitates in the formation. When the well is placed back into production, the inhibitor is slowly produced back into the well bore with the produced water to inhibit scale formation.
The most commonly used classes of inhibitor compounds are phosphonic acid salts, phosphate ester salts and polymeric (generally low molecular weight acrylic acid salts or modified polyacrylamide and copolymers thereof). Inorganic phosphates are also used but to a lesser extent. In squeeze treatments, the selection of the inhibitor used should be based upon which product gives the longest squeeze life, assuming inhibition and temperature stability requirements are satisfied.
A procedure called "precipitation squeeze" has been developed. In this process, the scale inhibitor reacts or is reacted to form an insoluble salt which precipitates in the pores of the formation rock. For example, see the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,860,829 in which a phosphonate scale inhibitor and a calcium chelate are employed as a "precipitation squeeze" treatment. The use of a phosphinico polycarboxylate in a precipitation squeeze treatment was disclosed in Results of Field Tests With a New Extended Squeeze Life Scale Inhibitor, a paper presented by J. E. Pardue at the 1992 NACE annual conference and corrosion show.
The present inventors have discovered that polyepoxysuccinic acid (hereinafter PESA) is an effective "squeeze treatment" for inhibiting scale formation in fluids produced from subterranean reservoirs. PESA is an effective scale control agent at substoichiometric or threshold levels. PESA controls scale formation without forming inhibitor-calcium complexes such as precipitates. PESA is effective at inhibiting the deposition of calcium scales such as calcium oxylate, calcium sulfate, as well as the more common calcium carbonate. PESA is also effective at inhibiting the deposition of barium and strontium sulfate scales. In addition to resisting the formation of inhibitor-calcium complexes, PESA is also tolerant to the presence of iron, in comparison to prior art scale control treatments such as polyacrylic acid.
The process of the present invention comprises pumping PESA either alone or with other scale control agents into a subterranean formation in a "squeeze treatment". The PESA has the general formula ##STR2## where n ranges from about 2 to 50, preferably 2 to 25, M is hydrogen or a water soluble cation such as Na.sup.+, NH.sub.4.sup.+ or K.sup.+ and R is hydrogen, C.sub.1-4 alkyl or C.sub.1-4 substituted alkyl. Preferably, R is hydrogen. The use of PESA as a scale control agent in aqueous systems as well as a method of preparing PESA is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,062,962 and 5,147,555 incorporated herein by reference.
