[0191] Pouring of a concentrated liquid 34 into the storage section 18 is then carried out in a condition where the folded empty container 10a is turned in such a manner that the pouring-opening 40 is located at the upper position. More particularly, the pouring of the concentrated liquid 34 into the storage section 18 is performed by causing the nozzle 44a of the filler 44 to be inserted into the pouring-opening 40. At this time, the concentrated liquid stored within the storage section 18 does not contact the sealing portions 32 of the seal sheets 28a, 28b. The pouring-opening 40 is finally sealed after the pouring of the concentrated liquid is completed, whereby a finished container is produced.
[0192] Incidentally, maintaining of the container in the folded condition may be performed by inserting the opposite wall portions including the first and second opposite wall regions into a space between the belt-like stopper 54 and the surface of the storage section 18, and causing the nicks 56 to be engaged with an edge region of the belt-like stopper 54. However, the maintaining of the container in the folded condition may be performed utilizing any suitable damper means.
[0193] In this method, the storing of the concentrated liquid 34 into the storage section 18 is carried out in the state where the sealing portions 32 of the seal sheets 28a, 28b are brought to the protected condition, so that the contents do not enter between the sealing portions 32 of the seal sheets 28a, 28b, and the adhesion between the sealing portions 32 hardly fall. Also, the contents hardly flow between the sealing portions 32 of the seal sheets 28a, 28b, and hardly flow toward the openable section 20. Furthermore, the contents hardly attach onto inner surfaces of the first opposite wall regions forming the openable section 20, and inner surfaces of the opposite seal sheets 28a, 28b. In addition, after the opening 21 is formed by tearing the areas of the first opposite wall regions forming the openable section 20, the person can sanitarily handle the container without touching the contents when the person is to cause the opening 21 to be widely broadened in order to facilitate storing of any additional substance into the storage section 18.
[0194] Incidentally, in the above-mentioned method, the openable section 20 and the communicating section 22 are folded over the storage section 18 at an angle of about 180 degrees relative to the storage section 18, whereby the storage section 18 is substantially isolated from the communicating section 22. However, it is unnecessary to always cause the openable section 20 and communicating section 21 to be folded over the storage section 18 at an angle of about 180 degrees relative to the storage section 18.
