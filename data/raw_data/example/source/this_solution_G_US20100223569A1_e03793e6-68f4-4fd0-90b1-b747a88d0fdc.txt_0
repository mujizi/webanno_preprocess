[0002] Portable electronic devices including cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and handheld computers include many different applications that are stored on and executable by the devices. Examples of applications include: instant messaging, text messaging, email, calendar, address book, games and music player applications. Typically, each application is represented by an icon that is displayed on a home screen of the device. In addition to application icons, a portion of the home screen is provided for display of a battery status indicator, time and date information and a signal reception status indicator. Because the screen size of most portable electronic devices is small, device home screens often appear cluttered. The cluttered appearance makes it difficult for a user to locate and select an application quickly.
[0003] Some applications generate notifications in response to an event such as an incoming text message, an incoming email, or an upcoming calendar event, for example. Notifications are often indicated by a change in the appearance of the icon that is associated therewith. When the home screen is cluttered, a user may not notice that a notification has been generated. As a result, the user may not read an important email message or may not be reminded of an appointment in time.
[0004] One solution for de-cluttering the appearance of a home screen is to provide folders. By opening a folder, the user may view the application icons that are stored in the folder as well as application icons that are stored in sub-folders. Although this solution may reduce the cluttered appearance of the user's home screen, the user is tasked with remembering where each application has been stored. It is therefore desirable to provide another solution to de-clutter the appearance of a home screen of a portable electronic device.
