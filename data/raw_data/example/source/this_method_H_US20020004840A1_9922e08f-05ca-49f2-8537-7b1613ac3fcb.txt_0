[0013] If data transfer to the video buffer is so performed as to maintain such change of buffer occupancy as shown in FIG. 19B, MPEG standard assures that streaming is not disturbed due to underflow and overflow of the video buffer.
[0014] (Description of Reception Buffer for Transfer Jitter Absorption on Network)
[0015] As shown in FIG. 20, in a system where a server 201 and a terminal 202 are connected to each other through a network 203, a transfer rate fluctuates when MPEG data in a storage 210 is distributed. This fluctuation is due to a time for packet assembly in a generation module 211, a time for transfer procedure in network devices 204 and 205, a transfer delay time due to congestion on the network 203, for example. Thus, actually, the change of buffer occupancy shown in FIG. 19B cannot be maintained. As a method for reducing and absorbing such fluctuation of the transfer rate (transfer jitter), a content of the encoding rate sufficiently smaller than that of the bandwidth of the network is to be transferred. However, from a viewpoint of efficiently utilizing the network resource to provide high-quality video and audio, this method is not considered appropriate. Therefore, applied generally is a method for always transferring data a little ahead of time, and if data transfer is delayed, data shortage is compensated. In this case, the network devices 204 and 205 are provided with transmission and reception buffers 206 and 207, respectively.
[0016] Here, providing the reception buffer 207 on the terminal 202 side means approximately the same as increasing the capacity of a decoder buffer 208 from the standardized 224 KByte by the capacity of the reception buffer 207. For comparison, FIGS. 21A and 21B show the change of buffer occupancy before and after the reception buffer 207 being included. Here, FIG. 21A is the same as FIG. 19B.
[0017] By adding the reception buffer 207, the buffer capacity is increased, and the change of buffer occupancy looks as shown in FIG. 21B. Accordingly, even if the transfer rate of the network is decreased, the buffer will not underflow. On the other hand, the time vbv_delay is lengthened by a time corresponding to the capacity of the reception buffer 207. As a result, the starting time for decoding in a decoder 209 and the starting time for playback in a playback device 212 are both delayed. That is, the time to access a specific frame takes longer by the time taken for data storage in the reception buffer 207.
