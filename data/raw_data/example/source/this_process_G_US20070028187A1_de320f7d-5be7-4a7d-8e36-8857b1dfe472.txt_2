[0201] FIG. 26 is a diagram of an example of a virtual cube displayed by the display processing unit 1901 after the selection accepting unit 403 accepts selection of a surface having an input function marking LOAD shown thereon, accepts selection of PC and MFP as input objects, that is, reception sources, and accepts selection of a surface 2602 having an output function marking PRINT shown thereon. A procedure for displaying a screen shown in the figure is explained. First, when the user depresses PC as an input object after depressing the surface 2601 having LOAD shown thereon, the input processing unit 411 performs input processing of image data stored in the PC. When the user depresses MFP as an input object after depressing the surface 2601 having LOAD shown thereon again, the input processing unit 411 performs input processing for image data stored in the MFP 1900. Consequently, the display processing unit 1901 displays a preview of a summary of a result obtained by performing the input processing for each of the PC and the MFP 1900, which are input objects, selection of which is accepted.
[0202] Thereafter, when selection of a surface 2603 having an output function marking PRINT shown thereon is accepted, detailed setting and the like are performed. The display processing unit 1901 displays a preview showing a summary of a result obtained by performing output processing using the image data acquired by the input processing in the surface 2603 having PRINT shown thereon. Thereafter, when the user depresses the start key 308, output processing by the output processing unit 412 is performed. In this way, when the selection accepting unit 403 accepts selection of a plurality of input objects from one input function, the input processing unit 411 can perform input processing of the image data using the identical input function. Moreover, the output processing unit 412 can subject one or more image data generated from the image data subjected to the input processing to output processing.
[0203] FIG. 27 is a diagram of an example of a screen for accepting selection of an input object displayed by the display processing unit 1901 when selection of a surface having SCAN shown thereon of the virtual cube is accepted. The display processing unit 1901 performs enlarged display processing for one surface of the virtual cube. As shown in the figure, an item key indicated as PAPER is displayed on the surface enlarged. When the user depresses the item key PAPER, the selection accepting unit 403 accepts selection of the item key PAPER and considers that paper is accepted as an input object. Consequently, the input processing unit 411 judges that selection of paper as an input object is accepted and starts input processing of a paper original. When there is only one item key as shown in the figure, this processing may be omitted. Thereafter, the display processing unit 1901 displays a preview showing a summary of a result obtained by performing the input processing. When surfaces having other input functions shown thereon are depressed, processing up to display of a preview showing a summary of a result obtained by performing input processing is performed according to the same processing procedure.
[0204] FIG. 28 is a diagram of an example of a screen for accepting selection of input objects displayed by the display processing unit 1901 when selection of a surface having RECEIVE shown thereof of the virtual cube is accepted. As in the processing procedure described above, item keys indicated as FAX and EMAIL are displayed on an enlarged surface. When the user depresses the item key FAX, the selection accepting unit 403 accepts selection of the item key FAX and considers that a Fax original is accepted as an input object. When the user depresses the item key EMAIL, the selection accepting unit 403 accepts selection of the item key EMAIL and considers that an e-mail received in the name of the user authenticated by the user authenticating unit 406 is accepted as an input object. The input processing unit 411 applies input processing to the input objects for which these selections are accepted.
[0205] FIG. 29 is a diagram of an example of a screen for accepting selection of input objects displayed by the display processing unit 1901 when selection of a surface having LOAD shown thereon of the virtual cube is accepted. As shown in the figure, the display processing unit 1901 displays items keys MFP, DESKTOP, INTERNET, NETWORK, and STORAGE on an enlarge surface. When the user depresses any one of these item keys, the selection accepting unit 403 accepts selection of the item key depressed and considers that selection of a corresponding medium as an input object.
