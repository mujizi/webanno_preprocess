Moreover, in the embodiment 2, the disturbance light is attenuated by the BPF 40 and the images reflected on retinas are photographed by the CCD camera 10 having wide wavelength band width sensitivity. But, photoelectric transforming devices having sensitivity only near the emitted light wavelength of the infrared ray LED may be used without using the BPF 40.
EMBODIMENT 3.
FIG. 9 is a block diagram showing the driver photographing apparatus of the embodiment 3 of the present invention. In the aforementioned embodiment 2, the infrared ray LED 20 having comparatively narrow emission light wavelength band as an illuminating means, then the embodiment 2 has a problem that the light components passing the BPF 40 become small according to temperature changing because infrared ray LEDs have specific characters that their emission light wavelengths vary in accordance with temperature. It may solve this problem to widen the wavelength band width of the BPF 40, but to widen the wavelength band width of the BPF 40 causes another problem that the suppressing effect of the disturbance light becomes smaller in proportion to make the wavelength band width wider.
In this embodiment 3, the lamp 22 having a wide emission light wavelength band (for example, a reflex lamp or an incandescent lamp) is used as the illuminating means, and the lamp 22 is driven by the lamp driving circuit 23. Moreover, the BPF 40 is disposed between the illuminating means 22 and the driver 1 and between the driver 1 and the CCD camera 10.
Next, the operation of this embodiment will be described.
