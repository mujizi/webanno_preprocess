[1268] Referring again to FIG. 59, step 9056 comprises the treatment with the therapeutic agent under test. By way of example, but not limitation, the second therapy may be thermal therapy, radiation, pharmaceutical therapy, or the like. By way of further example, the second regimen may be a combination of two or more therapies.
[1269] Steps 9057-9059 comprise analyzing the new absorption spectrum of the treated cells. Step 9054 comprises comparing the result from step 9059 against the baseline absorption spectrum obtained in step 9050. The object of this step is to determine if the result has changed. If a change is observed, the cell divisional process has been disrupted. If no change is observed, the therapeutic agent under test step may be modified in step 9061 and the process repeated in steps 9056-9059. Step 9061 varies the therapeutic agent under test by conventional methods well known to those skilled in the art. By way of example, the therapeutic agent under test may be incrementally increased or decreased. By way of further example, one may use alternate therapeutic agents under test, e.g. an array of pharmaceutical therapies.
[1270] Thus, evaluating the effectiveness of the therapeutic agent is done in vivo and in real time by insonifying the target dividing cells with sonic energy at about the actual resonant frequency of the mitotic spindle microtubules to evaluate the disruption of said microtubules. The object of this process is the accumulation of a data and analysis to identify conditions in which microtubules are most effectively disrupted by the therapeutic agent under test. By selectively disrupting the microtubules of the diseased or malignant cells, those cells will be unable to divide and the spread of the diseased or cancerous cells will be decreased or halted.
[1271] In one preferred embodiment, the response seen at step 9054 includes a decrease in time and increase in rate of disruption of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the therapeutic agent under test. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9054 includes an increase in time and decrease in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the therapeutic agent under test. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9054 includes decrease in time and decrease in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the therapeutic agent under test. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9054 includes an increase in time and increase in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the therapeutic agent under test. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9064 includes no change in time or rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the therapeutic agent under test.
[1272] The invention has been described by reference to certain preferred embodiments. Various additions and modifications within the spirit of the invention will occur to those of skill in the art; and they are intended to be comprehended within the scope of the invention.
