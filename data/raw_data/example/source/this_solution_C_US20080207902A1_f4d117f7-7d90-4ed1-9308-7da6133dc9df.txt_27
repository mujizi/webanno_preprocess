Example 129
2-ethyl-7-(piperidine-1-yl)-4-propionyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0427]The compound of Example 110 (218 mg) was dissolved in DMF (10.0 mL). To this solution, piperidine (0.66 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at 60.degree. C. for 5 hours. Subsequently, water was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification of the residue by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=5:1) afforded the title compound as a pale yellow powder (190 mg).
