More particularly, the preprocessor serially scans through each digitized image in search of images having cellular features that fall within a designated range suggesting a likelihood that the specimen area is of interest. These features may include, for example, specified size, shape, color, optical density (gray level range), texture, and topology (architecture relative to other cells) and combinations of such parameters. Additionally, the preprocessor may also consider other factors pertinent to determining whether given regions of the specimen are likely to be of interest. These factors may include, for instance, data regarding patient medical history and demographics, such as an indication that the patient from whom the sample was drawn is particularly at risk for cancer or other diseases. Such information may automatically signal to the preprocessor that certain cell or field-of-view images that would otherwise be of little interest to a cytotechnologist may be more likely to be of interest. Therefore, the preprocessor may adjust the level of likelihood that various regions of the specimen are of interest, based on such information.
Based on its automated analysis of these parameters, the preprocessor computes an atypicality and complexity index for each image and/or each field-of-view. The preprocessor then stores in a buffer indications of cell or field-of-view locations associated with cells or fields-of-view having varying levels of potential atypicality or complexity, preferably in descending order of atypicality or complexity. In addition, the preprocessor may compute and store an indication of its level of confidence in its probability estimate, such as, for instance, an indication that it is 80% certain that an area of is of interest (e.g., atypical or complex), or that it is only 20% confident in its finding.
In the preferred embodiment, the preprocessor also isolates each image of an atypical or suspicious cell or field-of-view apart from any background images, to facilitate preview display of the diagnostically significant images. For instance, the preprocessor may identify the location of a cell or field-of-view in a given digital image and, through automated image processing, eliminate the background around the area of interest and enhance the edges of the cell or field-of-view image. Alternatively, the preprocessor may shade the background area, in order to usefully retain a visual context of the cell or field-of-view while highlighting the area specifically of interest. This process may require one or more passes through the stored digital images of the specimen.
In addition, the preprocessor may perform other functions to enhance the preview stage. For instance, the preprocessor may be configured to automatically flag certain pieces of information as likely to be pertinent. For instance, the preprocessor may be configured to identify specimens that may be inadequate for one reason or another, such as due to questionable collection, fixation or staining. Rather than rejecting such specimens outright, the preprocessor may set a flag indicating that collection may have been inadequate. As another example, the preprocessor may be configured to identify clusters of cells in the specimen and to flag such areas of the specimen as likely to be pertinent in the cytotechnologist's analysis.
Once the preprocessor has completed its initial processing of the specimen images and data pertinent to the specimen under analysis, the preview workstation displays biasing-information for viewing by the cytotechnologist. As indicated above, one category of such information may be images of the specimen. In this regard, the preprocessor preferably displays at the preview workstation a discrete set of the apparently "most atypical," "most suspect," or "most complex" regions (cells or fields-of-view) for consideration by the cytotechnologist. As depicted in FIGS. 5 and 6, for example, the preprocessor may display a grid of a predetermined number of the most suspect objects or fields. These images may depict either the individual cells or fields-of-view with background images removed or shaded as discussed above. Additionally, the preprocessor may highlight some of the images in this grid (for instance, with color or shading) based on the preprocessor's automated findings, so as to focus the cytotechnologist's attention on particular matters. Similarly, in a preferred embodiment, the preprocessor may display in conjunction with various discrete images, or in relation to the specimen as a whole, a graphical scale or text indicating the preprocessor's degree of confidence in its findings that particular aspects of the specimen are likely to be of interest.
