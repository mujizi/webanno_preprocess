[0793] Referring again to FIG. 5, and to the preferred embodiment depicted therein, in step 265 one can determine the harmonic frequencies that correspond to the resonant frequency determined in step 264. One may use a first harmonic of such resonant frequency, a second harmonic of such resonant frequency, and, in fact, any harmonic of the resonant frequency. As is known to those skilled in the art, a harmonic is one of a series of sounds, each of which has a frequency that is ain integral multiple of some fundamental frequency.
[0794] One may apply the resonant frequency to the stabilized microtubules and/or one of the harmonic frequencies, and/or a second of the harmonic frequencies and/or a third of the harmonic frequencies and/or a fourth of the harmonic frequencies and/or a fifth of the harmonic frequencies, etc. These frequencies may be applied simultanoueously, and/or they may be applied sequentially. One may alternate this application of frequency or frequencies with the administration of one or more stabilizing agents and/or synchronizing agents and/or antimototic agents and/or cytotacitc agents.
[0795] In this process, and in step 266 thereof, one may use any of the means for generating and focusing ultrasound energy that are known to those skilled in the art. Thus, e.g., one may use the ultrasound generator disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,685,639, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification. This patent claims: "A high intensity focused ultrasound system, comprising: a controllable power supply; a B-mode ultrasound scanner; a therapeutic bed having a through hole; a liquid bag placed in the through hole and having opposite upper and lower portions, the lower portion of the liquid bag being attached to a combined probe, whereby a body portion of a patient lying immediately above the through hole may be scanned and treated by said system; and the combined probe comprising: a therapeutic head coupled to said controllable power supply for generating and focusing a ultrasound beam on a focal region at a temperature greater than 70 degrees centigrade, said therapeutic head comprising a ultrasound lens and piezoelectric ceramics coupled to said controllable power supply and disposed beneath the ultrasound lens, and an imaging probe coupled to said B-mode ultrasound scanner and mounted on a central axis of said therapeutic head so that the focal region of said therapeutic head is fixed at a predetermined location on a scanning plane; wherein said liquid bag contains vacuum degassed water having an acoustic impedance similar to that of human tissue, the upper portion of said liquid bag including an opening exposing said vacuum degassed water, said opening being open to an upper surface of said therapeutic bed so as said vacuum degassed water is adapted to be placed in direct contact with the skin of the patient's body portion; said system further comprising a multi-dimensional motional apparatus, on which the combined probe is mounted and which is moveable along three-dimensional rectangular coordinate axes and rotatable about one or two rotational coordinate axes, for driving said combined probe, said multidimensional motional apparatus includes a plurality of one-dimensional motional devices each being configured to either translate or rotate said combined probe in a specific direction."
[0796] By way of yet further illustration, and not limitation, one may use one or more of the ultrasound generators described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,735,756 (duplex ultrasound generator); U.S. Pat. No. 4,718,421 (ultrasound generator); U.S. Pat. No. 4,957,100 (ultrasound generator and emitter); U.S. Pat. No. 4,976,255 (extracorporeal lithotripsy using shock waves and therapeutic ultrasound); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,102,534; 5,184,065 (therapeutic ultrasound generator); U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,069 (therapeutic ultrasound applicator for the urogenital region); U.S. Pat. No. 6,270,342; and the like. The entire disclosure of each of these United States patents is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification.
[0797] By way of further illustration, one may also use the ultrasound generator disclosed in an article by article by I. Hrazdira et al., "Ultrasonicallly inducted altrations of cultured tumour cells," European Journal of Ultrasound 8: 43-49, 1998. At page 45 of this article, is it disclosed that: "A laboratory generator operating at a frequency of 0.8 MHz was used as the source of continuous ultrasound."
