[0069] Spinning works which manufacture fancy yarn have the need to differentiate between the following two phenomena: [0070]on the one hand, the virtual base yarn manufacture, which may introduce imperfections, irregularities and faults such as thick places or thin places into the yarn, and [0071]on the other hand, the slub manufacture which incorporates the desired slubs onto the virtual base yarn, e.g. in the form of thickenings.
[0072] These two phenomena are sometimes impossible or difficult to differentiate with conventional yarn testing methods and apparatus. The exemplary curve of FIG. 4 was selected for didactic reasons, so that it is quite clear from this, what a slub 102 is and what a base yarn 101 is. In practice however, the undesired thickness fluctuations on the base yarn 101 may be so large, that they exceed the threshold value M.sub.T and as a result are wrongly considered to be a slub on evaluation. The results of the evaluation are therefore adulterated. The results of this may lead to the wrong measures being taken in the manufacturing process. If e.g. long thick places or yarn mass fluctuations are assumed to be small slubs, the part process for slub manufacture is changed such that larger slubs may be produced. This measure unnecessarily changes the slub structure without alleviating the actual cause of the fault--perhaps a defect in one path.
[0073] Here, a preferred embodiment solves this problem by way of specifying the definition of a slub. The method described on the occasion of FIG. 4 may be disadvantageous since on setting the threshold value M.sub.T, it only takes into account a one-dimensional mass increase. As described, although one may attempt to reduce this disadvantage by way of the demand that the excess must last for a certain length. This however also does not lead to an optimal recognition of the slubs. The observation of an area below the measurement curve--or what is considered here as being equivalent to the area, a certain integral of the measurement curve, has been shown to be more advantageous. Such an area may be computed at least approximately with one of the known numeric integration methods, like with the rectangle or trapezium method. FIG. 21 schematically shows a typical course of the area A(x) computed in this manner, as a function of the length coordinate x, wherein the previously determined base yarn mass M.sub.S (see FIG. 4) serves as basis for determining the area. The values of A(x) fluctuate around the value zero in the region of the base yarn 101. Any thick places, even if they have a large mass increase, do not cause any significant area changes, since they only extend in each case over a short length interval. A real slub 92 differs from a thick place in that it causes a significant rise of the curve A(x) which sets in at the beginning of a slub 102. A local maximum 105 of the slub 92 which may also be described as the position of the slub 92, is located at the turning point of the curve A(x). After the slub end 104, the curve A(x) again fluctuates around a constant value, which indicates the slub total mass. If one ascertains such a slub end 104, then the further course of the curve may be set back to the value zero by way of subtraction of the value M.sub.E. A further base yarn follows etc. All slubs and their positions may be recognized in a reliable and stable manner and be differentiated from thick places by way of this.
[0074] The ascertaining of a slub is preferably made dependent on the simultaneously fulfillment of several criteria, e.g. of the following three criteria:
(i) exceeding a predefined threshold value for the area A(x),(ii) exceeding a predefined threshold value for the slub length L.sub.E, and(iii) exceeding a predefined threshold value for the mass increase .DELTA.M.
