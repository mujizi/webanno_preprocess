[0013] If the installation space available does not allow a compact unit, however, it is also possible for the reservoir to be connected to the compensating space by means of a flow connection.
[0014] Other possible designs consist in locating the compensating space and the reservoir outside the piston-cylinder unit. It is advantageous here for only the piston-cylinder unit to be provided between the vehicle body and the wheel suspension and for both the reservoir and the compensating space to be located, by way of an appropriate flow connection, at any suitable point in the vehicle not in the immediate vicinity of the piston-cylinder unit.
[0015] According to another feature, the electric motor is actuated manually or automatically by a sensor. According to this solution, either the piston-cylinder unit is actuated manually, or an independently working level control system can be achieved by the use of appropriate sensors to detect the position of the vehicle body.
[0016] The vehicle can also be stabilized against rolling movements by appropriate actuation of the piston-cylinder units at the various wheels of the vehicle. In this case, only inside-curve and outside-curve piston-cylinder units of the wheel to be stabilized are actuated independently of each other.
[0017] According to another embodiment, a shut-off valve operating as a function of flow is provided between the compensating space and the reservoir, or a shut-off valve operating as a function of pressure is provided between the compensating space and the reservoir. It is advantageous here that forces which surge abruptly into the piston-cylinder unit have no effect on the actual level control function itself, i.e., forces which otherwise would simulate an unloaded or a loaded vehicle.
