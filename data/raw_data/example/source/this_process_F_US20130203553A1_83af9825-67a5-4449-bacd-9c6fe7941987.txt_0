[0027] In operations, when wear between gears occurs, the elastic force of the elastic body 184 will act upon the blocking block 182 and the first planetary gear 1620, and the blocking block 182 will act on the second planetary gear 1622, so that the second planetary gear 1622 and the sun gear set 20 can achieve zero backlash. The elastic force of the elastic body 184 will make the first slot 164 to move outward along the engaging face of the second slot 166, and the engaging face of the blocking block 182, so as to make the first planetary gear to move outward, so that the first planetary gear 1620 and the internal gear 14 can achieve zero backlash. Through the action of the buffer mechanism 18, the first planetary gear 1620 and the second planetary gear 1622 are made to produce relative displacement, so that the first planetary gear 1620, the second planetary gear 1622, and the blocking block 182 are in close contact. The buffer mechanism 18 is capable of eliminating automatically the backlashes between all the gear pairs in the planetary gear mechanism. The direction of action of the elastic body 184 is different from the direction of torque transmission, and the elastic force is far less than the transmission torque, so that when the mechanism is in forward or reverse rotation, the first planetary gear 1620, the second planetary gear 1622, and the blocking block 182 are in close contact, such that the rotation angle has no transmission errors, and the transmission torque has no time delay, and the mechanism has better stiffness.
[0028] Finally, refer to FIG. 6 for a cross section view of a torsion mechanism according to the present invention. As shown in FIG. 6, both sides of the first slot 164 and the second slot 166 of the first planetary gear 1620 and the second planetary gear 1622 are provided respectively with a torsion mechanism 22. The torsion mechanism 22 is used to make the first planetary gear 1620 and the second planetary gear 1622 to produce relative displacement, so that the first slot 164 and the second slot 166 are engaged and in close contact. When the wear between the gears occurs, the torsion mechanism 22 will make the first planetary gear 1620 and the second planetary gear 1622 to produce relative rotation, so that the third slant side 1644 engaged with the fifth slant side 1664 to produce relative displacement, to eliminate backlash between respective engaging gear pairs, so that in forward and reverse rotations the zero backlash planetary gear train is able to maintain in a gear zero backlash state.
[0029] Summing up the above, when backlash between gears occurs, the two planetary gears are made to produce relative movements through a mechanism, to eliminate backlash between gears, so that in both forward and reverse rotations, the planetary gear train can achieve zero backlash. Also, in this process, in both the forward and reverse rotations, the torque is transmitted through rigid body transmission, thus having the advantages of: better stiffness, increased precision, reduced vibration, lower noise, and zero backlash. In assembly, the zero backlash planetary gear train can allow greater assembly tolerance for the gear pairs, in achieving higher assembly efficiency.
