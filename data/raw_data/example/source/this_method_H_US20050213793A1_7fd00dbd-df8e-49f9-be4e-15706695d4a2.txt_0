[0123] Next, a method for setting a color area will be described with reference to FIGS. 13A and 13B. In FIG. 13A, a color space 1111, whose horizontal axis is set as the hue and vertical axis is set as the chroma, and a color area 1112 existing on the color space are displayed in the window 1110. The color area 1112 displayed in a rectangular shape indicates the ranges of the hue and chroma and the camera server 200 tracks an object having a color in the color area 1112. It is possible to set the color setting area 1112 not only through input of values into a hue range setting portion 1113 and a chroma range setting portion 1114 but also through direct dragging of the color area 1112 with a mouse cursor. When the setting of the color area is finished, the values are reflected through pressing down of an OK button 1115 or the process is terminated without reflecting the values through pressing down of a cancel button 1116.
[0124] In order to check the setting values while displaying the window 1110, a preview button 1117 is selected. Through the selection of the OK button 1115 or the preview button 1117, area information of the color area 1112 is sent to the camera server 200. The camera server 200 receives the information and reflects it in the tracking process. Note that an indicator 1118 indicates values of the chroma and the hue obtained through integration of images currently sent from the camera server 200. When the color area 1112 is set in the vicinity of the indicator 1118, that is, when the chroma and the hue of the object that is the tracking target are similar to those of a background, the accuracy of the tracking is lowered. In this embodiment, however, it is possible for the user to set the color area with reference to the indicator, so it becomes possible for him/her to make settings concerning the tracking with accuracy.
[0125] Also, as another method for inputting the color space, there is a method with which an area that is desired to be set as the detection target is directly designated on an image distributed from the camera server 200. With this method, for instance, in FIG. 2, a flesh color portion of a person is designated with a mouse cursor and the color area is determined based on the color distribution of peripheral pixels. A color designated during this operation is displayed as the color area 1112 of the window 1110 and it is possible for the user to check the color area 1112. Note that as a method for designating the area, it is also possible to set a group of points existing within a certain distance from a point designated with the mouse cursor as a target of totalization or to designate an area having an arbitrary shape, such as a rectangular area, on an image and set a group of points existing in the area as the totalization target. Even through such designation, a situation is obtained in which the maximum detection area and its centroid position shown in FIG. 11 are displayed, so it becomes possible for the user to grasp which area should be set as the tracking target area with ease.
[0126] It should be noted here that when the tracking process by color information is performed, color area information and on-screen area designation information are sent from the setting client 300 to the camera server 200 as setting information. More specifically, in the case of the area designation method shown in FIG. 13A, the minimum value of chroma becomes "C0", the maximum value of the chroma becomes "C1", the minimum value of the hue becomes "H0", and the maximum value of the hue becomes "H1". Also, when a point on the screen is designated, the pixel coordinate position of the point becomes (Ix, Iy).
[0127] On the other hand, when the tracking process by color information is performed, information sent from the camera server 200 to the setting client 300 in the case of the detection state is the same as that in the embodiment described above but color detection pixels and labels (or color detection blocks and labels), the maximum label number, the size of the maximum label area, and the centroid position of the color detection area are sent in the case of the tracking state. They are expressed as follows.
