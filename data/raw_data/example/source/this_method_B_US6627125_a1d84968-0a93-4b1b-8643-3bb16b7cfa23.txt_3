a second step for forming a second light transmitting layer bonded to said light blocking layer by bonding said light transmitting layer and third master with a second light transmitting layer precursor disposed therebetween; and
a third step for separating the third master from the second light transmitting layer and light blocking layer.
With this method the light blocking layer formed in the light blocking recess of the third master forms a black matrix integrated with the second light transmitting layer.
Furthermore, once manufactured, the third master can be used repeatedly insofar as durability allows. The steps required to produce the master can therefore be eliminated from the production process for the second and subsequent optical substrates, thereby further reducing the number of production steps and helping to further reduce cost.
(8) In the seventh method described above the second step preferably aligns the light blocking recess of the third master so that the lenses of the light transmitting layer are each enclosed when bonding the light transmitting layer to the third master. This assures that light gathered by each of the lenses passes each of the pixels of the color filter divided by the black matrix.
