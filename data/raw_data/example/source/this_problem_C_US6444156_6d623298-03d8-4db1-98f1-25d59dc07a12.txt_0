The preferred practice has been to use metal core wicks in gel candles, because such wicks are capable of withstanding the high temperatures during the filling process. Non-metal core wicks have generally not been used, because they have a strong tendency to bend or wilt in high temperature mediums, thereby resulting in gel candles with off-centered or submerged wicks. Off-centered wicks can lead to cracking of the candle container during burning, due to the closer proximity of the flame to the container wall.
Several drawbacks, however, are associated with using metal core wicks in gel candles. By definition, a metal core wick is a rigid wick, and therefore, burns in a mostly vertical direction in the coldest, center region of the flame. As used herein, "rigid wick" is synonymous with a metal core wick; whereas "less rigid wick" is synonymous with a non-metal core wick. Burning of wicks in the coldest regions of the flame leads to three specific problems. First, a smaller flame size results, which can be aesthetically unpleasing. Second, undesirable-looking charred portions of the wick fall into the liquid pool of gel that forms around the burning wick, due to the incomplete burning of the wick in the coldest regions of the flame. Third, these charred portions sometimes can accumulate around the wick throughout the candle life, resulting in a pile of charred wick portions capable of flaring up and/or creating excessive heat during the last hours of candle usage. These charred portions are also aesthetically unpleasing.
Non-metal core wicks avoid the drawbacks associated with metal core wicks, because non-metal core wicks, being less rigid, bend into the hotter parts of the flame during burning. However, as mentioned above, current gel candle manufacturing processes result in non-metal core wicks being bent, wilted, or submerged in gel candle bodies. Although this problem could be resolved to an extent on a small scale if the wick were physically held in the proper place, this solution is not feasible if gel candles are being mass-produced.
U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,089 (the '089 patent) relates to clear gel candle compositions. The '089 patent briefly discusses a method of making gel candles and mentions generally that a wick is placed in a candle body before the gel firms up. This patent, however, does not disclose or suggest how to produce a gel candle containing a non-metal core wick that is not bent, wilted, or submerged in the candle body.
It is desirable, therefore, to produce a gel candle having a non-metal core wick that stands upright in the candle body. By standing upright, we mean that the wick is located in substantial alignment with a longitudinal axis running through the candle container. Preferably, the longitudinal axis runs through the center of the candle container.
