Example 4
A cotton T-shirt (smooth knit, 150 parts) was scoured to remove the sizing and impurities.
Next, an aqueous solution containing 3000 parts of water (bath ratio=1:20), 1.5 parts of AMIGEN NF (trade name, quaternary ammonium salt type cationic polymer compound, product of Dai-ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd.) and 10 parts of ethylene glycol were added to a 5-l vat. The T-shirt described above was immersed in this solution and gradually heated to 60.degree. C., at which temperature it was treated for 20 minutes.
Subsequently, this T-shirt was thoroughly rinsed with water and dehydrated. Next, 3000 parts of water and 22.5 parts of the photochromic microcapsules obtained in Preparation Example 4 were added to this vat, and this solution was gradually heated to 70.degree. C., at which temperature it was treated for 15 minutes to exhaust the photochromic microcapsules into this T-shirt. Subsequently, this T-shirt was thoroughly rinsed with water and dehydrated, after which it was allowed to dry and then subjected to tumbler drying to yield a T-shirt on the entire surface of which the photochromic microcapsules were fixed.
This T-shirt was found to be totally white under indoor conditions free of direct sunlight, while it changed its color to dark yellow at windows and outdoors under direct sun light. This change could be reversibly repeated in cycles, and the quality of the T-shirt was as good as in Examples 1 through 3.
