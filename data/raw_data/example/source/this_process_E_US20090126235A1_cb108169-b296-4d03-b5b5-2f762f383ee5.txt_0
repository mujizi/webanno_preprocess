[0086] FIG. 1 (a) to FIG. 1 (d) are schematic diagrams illustrating a process for generating a laser-induced shock wave. FIG. 2 (a) to FIG. 2 (c) are schematic diagrams illustrating a process for generating a laser-induced jet stream. FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating a process for generating a laser-induced bubble flow.
[0087] When a large amount of energy is applied in liquid over a short time period, a bubble is created due to rapid evaporation of the liquid, forming a shock wave in the liquid. Such an energy source includes discharge or explosion except for laser irradiation. In the present invention, this phenomenon is caused by using laser irradiation and a laser-induced force is generated.
[0088] A process for generating a shock wave in liquid by using laser irradiation is as follows. That is, as shown in FIG. 1(a), a pulsed laser beam is irradiated in liquid from the front end of an optical fiber 200 to a liquid 201, then plasma 202 is generated due to short time absorption of thermal energy contained in the laser beam by the liquid, producing strong shock waves 203,204 in a high-temperature and pressure state. Also, as shown in FIG. 1(b), a bubble 210 is created, grown up and contracts. FIG. 1(c) shows that the bubble 210 is in a contracted state. In this process, as shown in FIG. 1(d), when energy is again supplied by laser irradiation, the bubble 210 is re-expanded rapidly, generating the shock waves 203, 204 circumferentially along with the plasma 202.
[0089] In order that a laser is absorbed efficiently by liquid, it is required for an oscillation wavelength of the laser to approximate an absorption wavelength of the liquid. When a laser has a wavelength near a range of optical absorption wavelength of liquid, energy may be absorbed efficiently by an object having a large rate of content of liquid and in such an object, a shock wave and bubble may be efficiently generated.
[0090] FIG. 2(a) to FIG. 2(c) show the principle of a process for generating a laser-induced jet. As shown in FIG. 2(a), when an optical fiber 200 is disposed within a tube 220 filled with liquid 201 and a laser beam 221 having high absorptance of the liquid is irradiated through the optical fiber 200, as shown in FIG. 2(b), a bubble 222 is generated within the tube by the laser beam and the bubble 222, then, pushes out the liquid 201 from the tube, generating a jet 223.
