[0062] The cellulose acetate is dissolved in acetone while stirring with a homogenizer. The polyethylene glycol 400 and triacetin are added to the cellulose acetate solution and stirred until a clear solution is obtained. The clear membrane coating solution is then sprayed onto the seal coated tablets using a fluidized bed coater employing the following conditions: product temperature of 16-22.degree. C.; atomization pressure of approximately 3 bars and spray rate of 120-150 ml/min. The sealed core tablet is coated until a theoretical coating level of approximately 3% is obtained.
