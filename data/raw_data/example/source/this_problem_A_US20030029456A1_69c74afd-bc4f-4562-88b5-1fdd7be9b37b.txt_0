[0004] 2. Description of the Related Art
[0005] Protectors of the kind referred to are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,920,009 (Olsen)and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,022,394 (Chemielinski). The devices disclosed therein function well as a heat-moisture exchanger the respiration air following a straight flow path through the exchanger body between the first and second openings. However, these prior art protectors are disadvantageous as said second opening communicating with the surroundings can easily be covered by a shirt, scarf, or the like, and when this happens, the flow of respiration air through the stoma will be obstructed, causing difficulty in breathing.
[0006] A breathing protector of the kind referred to herein which attempts to alleviate this problem is described in WO 95/17138 (Persson). The respiration air also in this case follows a straight path through the exchanger body between the first and second openings. The protector includes a movable spring biased cover plate that can be depressed against the surface of the heat-moisture exchanger body at said second opening to shut off the flow of air through said body, the respiration air then passes through a voice prosthesis located in the wall between trachea and esophagus of the user. When the cover plate valve is not depressed, the respiration air flows through the breathing protector at right angles to the said straight path through the exchanger body at said second opening. The device therefore can be worn beneath, for example, a shirt without the flow of air to and from the user being obstructed. However, this prior art breathing protector has the disadvantage of being of a relatively complicated structure and being relatively expensive to manufacture due to the complexity thereof. Moreover, the prior art breathing protector has a relatively large axial length.
[0007] SE-B-348 643 (Gibeck), GB-A-2 214 089 (Andersson et al), and GB-A-2 250 201 (Andersson et al) disclose breathing protectors of the kind referred to herein which at said second opening are provided with an element that deflects, in a transverse direction, the respiration air flowing along the straight path through the heat-moisture exchanger body, but also these breathing protectors suffer from disadvantages similar to those of the breathing protector disclosed in WO 95/17138.
[0008] The primary object of the present invention is to provide a breathing protector which eliminates the risk of blocking of the flow of air and which is simultaneously of a very simple and reliable construction.
