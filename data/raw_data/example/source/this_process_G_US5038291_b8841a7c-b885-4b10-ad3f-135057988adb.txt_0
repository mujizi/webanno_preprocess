The computerized ply pattern generation process is alternatively described as: generating a 3-dimensional solid model of the part and first and second curved outer surfaces and a curved mid-surface thereof; decomposing the part model into nested shells by calculating distances from the outer surfaces to the mid-surface at a network of points and producing contours of the shells by interpolating along these distances; developing the shells in sequence to planar patterns by dividing every shell surface into 3-dimensional patches which are mapped to 2-dimensional unfolded surfaces and aligned; and determining contours of the planar patterns and the shape of the plies.
A feature of the method is that the outer surfaces may be doubly curved and the developing comprises integrating along patch borders and adjusting initial conditions to ensure that end points of different integration paths converge. Other procedures used as needed are trimming surfaces outside the boundaries of the ply, and deforming patch borders and merging to form a continuous ply.
The illustrative embodiments automatically generate patterns for manufacturing composite parts with pre-impregnated plies which are stacked and then pressed and cured in a mold. Aircraft engine parts including airfoils, vanes and blades may be made with this Process. More accurate ply patterns are generated in a relatively short time and yield better quality parts.
