The composite part 20 shown in FIG. 1 is typical of the complex shapes of aircraft engine components and demonstrates the advantages of generating ply patterns by a computerized method. This is a stator vane component, about 14 inches in length, and has a central blade or airfoil section 21 and curved ends 22 and 23 that are mounted on inner and outer shrouds. The airfoil section has doubly curved surfaces and both end sections are singly curved. The ply patterns 24 generated by the automated process are shown in FIG. 2 in their stacking positions. The patterns are cut out from a flat sheet of pre-impregnated material having a thickness of about 10 mils, and stacked one on top of the other in the order shown by the numbers on the right. The first two characters indicate the stacking sequence, and the third character designates the side of the mold to be placed. The fourth character is used for separate pieces in one ply. Another A set of 50 plies, having ply patterns that are different from those of the B set, are provided for the other half of the mold. The mold cavity has the same shape as the part being manufactured. After being pressed and cured in an autoclave or heated press such as that in U.S. Pat. No. 4,773,021, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, the result is the part in FIG. 1.
FIG. 3 is a cross section of an aircraft engine blade 25 showing the two sets of pre-impregnated plies 26 before pressing and curing in a mold. To assure the highest strength component, largest area plies are on the outside and the size of the plies decreases toward the center.
Solid modeling is used in this process to decompose a 3-dimensional part into nested shells, the thickness of each shell being equal to the net thickness of the pre-impregnated sheet material. Each shell is developed or laid flat into a planar surface. In general, a surface to be laid flat is non-developable and will have non-zero Gaussian curvature and cannot be laid flat without distortion. Pattern calculation thus require modeling the deformation of the process. Developable surfaces such as a cylinder by contrast can be unfolded and laid flat without distortion.
The flow chart in FIG. 4 gives the steps in an automated ply pattern generation process. The first step 27 is to provide, in a computer, a 3-dimensional solid geometric model of the part. The techniques of constructing a solid model, using the TRUCE (Tri-dimensional Rational Unified Cubic Engine) and other solid modelers, are well established and described in the literature. A description of the mid-surface and outer surfaces of the part are also provided. Steps 28-30 are computing iso-thickness contours on the curved surface, and unfolding or developing the surface and mapping contours to the unfolded surface. Steps 31 and 32 may not be essential to every ply pattern generation process but are often required for a complexly shaped part. These are to trim the contours that are outside a face or a portion of a surface of the part, and match and join the developed surfaces across adjacent faces on the part. Steps 30-32 are repeated for each ply. The final step 33 is cutting out the ply patterns from pre-impregnated sheets and the layup or stacking of the flat plies. The result is a kit of plies to be loaded into the mold cavity.
Decomposing the part model into nested shells is explained with reference to FIG. 5, which shows a cross section of the airfoil 21 and its outer curved surfaces 34 and 35 and curved mid-surface 36. To determine the boundary of the plies in 3-dimensional space, iso-thickness contours on the airfoil are computed. This is done by calculating the distance from an outer surface to the mid-surface. A network of points 37 are sampled from the outer surface and shortest distances 38 are calculated from each point to the mid-surface 36. The contours or shell boundaries are produced by interpolating along the sampled distances 38; this is illustrated schematically by the short dashed lines 39. The same procedure decomposes both singly curved end sections 22 and 23 of the part into a large number of nested shells.
