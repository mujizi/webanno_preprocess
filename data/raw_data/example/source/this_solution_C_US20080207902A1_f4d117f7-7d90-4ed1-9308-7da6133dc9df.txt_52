Example 340
2-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6-(7-methoxy-2-trifluoromethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]py-ridine-4-yl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-3-(2H)-pyridazin one
[1049]The compound of Example 337 (686 mg) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (5.00 mL). To this solution, a 2.00 mol/L dimethylamine/tetrahydrofuran solution (7.70 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at 50.degree. C. for 4 hours. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification of the residue by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=1:4) afforded the title compound as a colorless powder (313 mg).
