[0080] where the baseline value of a is about 0.2. The compensator time constants are .tau..sub.1=4.0 and .tau..sub.2=1.0.
[0081] The lead lag compensator reduces the tendency toward speed flight path coupled oscillations in the compound mode when the rotor speed control loop 1004 is in a non-saturated region. To keep the rotor speed control loop 1004 from saturating, which means that the collective command has bottomed, a change in the mast valve and cruise nozzle schedules are implemented to provide for more thrust in the helicopter mode and at the lower end of the compound mode. This results in the forward speed being maintained more by the cruise nozzle thrust than by tilting the rotor lift forward. If the equilibrium pitch attitude is near zero, then the perturbation response of the rotor speed control loop 1004 is aided by the appropriate polarity of drag change resulting from the pitch attitude modulation.
[0082] The effect of envelope limiting on the coupling phenomena discussed above is a control law issue. If the rotor lift is essentially zero, the lower end of collective travel is near. During this condition, if the aircraft 100 experiences a significant rate of descent, the envelope limits regarding the capability of the interacting control loops may be reached. Consider the initial response to a descent command via the insertion of a negative h dot command. The vertical control loop 1006 commands a nose down attitude, which is associated with an initial decrease in alpha followed by a drop in gamma as gamma approaches (hdot.sub.cmd/V). The drop in gamma results in an effective drag decrease, which may require a drop in throttle to maintain the reference airspeed. The decrease in alpha causes an increase in rotor torque, Q, which may require a drop in collective to allow the rotor speed control loop 1004 to maintain the reference omega (rotor speed). The drop in throttle lowers the available tip jet thrust needed to maintain the rotor speed thereby causing an additional command to drop the collective. The control capability ends when the bottom of available negative collective is reached. The steeper the rate of descent command, the more severe this problem becomes, because the throttle may be reduced to idle, and the minimum tip jet thrust needed to maintain rotor speed is lost. When the lower collective limit is reached, control is lost in the rotor speed control loop 1004. This condition is prevented from being reached by applying limits to the allowable h dot descend commands, depending upon the flight mode. The limit is most severe when the aircraft 100 is near the zero rotor lift condition.
[0083] FIG. 11 is a graph illustrating the adjustment of the mast valve and cruise nozzle schedule as a function of the vertical speed descent command. Looking at the graph, the x-axis represents the position of the mast valve 202 and the cruise nozzle 204 and the y-axis represents the velocity of the aircraft 100. The graph indicates a conversion speed of approximately 120 knots. Utilizing the mast valve and cruise nozzle schedule, the maneuvering capability of the aircraft is not unnecessarily limited and the prior control law definitions are changed to move the equilibrium collective position to a sufficiently high position if large rates of descent are commanded. When the rate of descent reference is equal to 0, the mast valve schedule is a function of V. As the descent angles are commanded, the mast valve 202 is kept open in proportion to the Hdot command. The cruise nozzle schedule tracks the mast valve schedule, so that the more the mast valve 202 remains open, the more the cruise nozzle 204 can be closed. Keeping the cruise nozzle 204 more closed during the descent maneuvers allows the equilibrium throttle position to be at a sufficiently high level to satisfy the airspeed control loop 1002, while keeping the tip jet torque sufficiently high to avoid the need for a large drop in collective. Therefore, the collective equilibrium condition is moved to a value sufficiently far removed from bottoming the collective when the control system 1000 is trying to maintain rotor speed.
[0084] Envelope limiting can be provided by the velocity vector control using the control stick inputs. Envelope limiting is an especially difficult task for an aircraft having multi-flight modes since the flight envelope is profoundly different depending upon the flight mode. For example, the maximum speed limits differ if the aircraft 100 is in the helicopter mode compared to the fixed wing mode. Moreover, when in the compound mode, depending upon the extent of rotor unloading, there is a different flight envelope. The velocity vector control technique allows for incorporating the instantaneous flight envelopes into the command processing of the control stick inputs.
