[0061] The mother liquor, containing 202 g of taurine and 216 g of sodium sulfate, is cooled to 33.degree. C. to form a second slurry of taurine. After filtration and washing with cold water, 124 g of taurine is obtained.
[0062] The mother liquor from the previous step, now containing 78 of taurine and 216 g of sodium sulfate, is cooled to 10.degree. C. in 2 hrs to obtain slurry of taurine and Glauber's salt. The crystalline solid is obtained as a mixture of taurine and sodium sulfate decahydrate.
[0063] This final mother liquor, about 500 g, is consisted of sodium ditaurinate and tritaurinate (28%, 140 g), taurine (24 g, 4.8%), and sodium sulfate (35 g, 7%). This solution is used for the ammonolysis reaction.
[0064] It will be understood that the foregoing examples, explanation, drawings are for illustrative purposes only and that in view of the instant disclosure various modifications of the present invention will be self-evident to those skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and the scope of the appended claims.
