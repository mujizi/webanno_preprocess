The invention provides a process comprising the treatment of lignocellulosic materials with monoperoxysulfuric acid or its salts with cations.
The tangible embodiments produced by this process aspect of the invention possess the inherent applied use characteristics of being lignocellulosic materials from which the non-cellulosic materials are more readily separated from cellulose thereby indicating usefulness in producing pulp or bleaching pulp for use in papermaking.
The invention also provides in a subgeneric process aspect a process for treating unpulped lignocellulosic material prior to conventional alkaline pulping which comprises treating said unpulped lignocellulosic material with monopersulfuric acid or a salt thereof.
The invention also provides in another subgeneric process aspect a process for bleaching pulp produced by conventional alkaline pulping of lignocellulosic material which comprises treating lignocellulosic pulp produced by said conventional alkaline pulping processes with monopersulfuric acid or a salt thereof.
