Example 235
6-(7-acetyl-2-ethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(-2H)-pyridazinone
[0694]The compound of Example 232 (30.0 mg) was dissolved in DMSO (1.00 mL) in an argon atmosphere. To this solution, triethylamine (140 .mu.L) and sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex (79.5 mg) were sequentially added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Subsequently, water was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification of the residue by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=1:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow amorphous material (28.9 mg).
