[0026] The openings 3 can have a shape and location that comply with particular, pre-defined specifications, as e.g. described in patent application NO EP 1184537A.
[0027] After stimulating of the well is at least two packers expanded in order to seal off a part of said annular space. However the packers could also be expanded prior to pumping of acid.
[0028] As described above, acid stimulation of the well takes place through the second fluid control means. During this process, the first fluid control means are usually closed. Since the second fluid control means do not allow fluid to flow into the production pipe, it is therefore necessary to subsequently open the first fluid control means to allow the production flow to run into the production pipe. The second fluid control means usually comprise one-way valves that allow fluid to flow from the interior of the well tubing and into the formation via the annular space, while the flow of fluid is blocked in the opposite direction. As mentioned above, this was described in particular for use in conventional production wells, and in that context the advantage obtained was that of achieving a higher degree of control of the valve, all production in the individual sections of the well (between two packers) taking place through the controllable first fluid control means. By that configuration it is thus obtained that it is possible to close off each of the sections by means of the first fluid control means, which may be convenient eg in the context of water breakthroughs.
[0029] However, the second fluid control means may also be constituted by valves that are provided with a mechanism which is capable of closing off the valves completely.
[0030] The embodiments of the invention described above relates mainly to conventional oil producing wells. However the invention can also be implemented in a well into which water or pressurized gas is pumped in order to push petroleum resources out of underground reservoirs toward a production wells so as to increase its production. Such a well is commonly known as a injection well. By using valves equipped with a (self-closing) mechanism which is capable of completely closing off the valves, it is accomplished that also "injector wells" can be stimulated with acid prior to being used. According to one embodiment for use in those wells "the second fluid control means" may thus be equipped with a closure mechanism that does not close until a given period of time has elapsed. The second fluid control means may also be equipped with a closure mechanism that does not close until the closure mechanism is activated by some kind of activation means, as e.g described below in connection with injection wells. Thereby it is obtained that (when the well is a recently established one) acid stimulation may take place through the second fluid control means while in their open state. When the second fluid control means are subsequently closed, the subsequent injection of water will take place via the first fluid control means in the individual sections of the well (between two packers) and thereby an increased control of that type of well is also accomplished since the individual sections can thereby be closed down by means of the first fluid control means.
