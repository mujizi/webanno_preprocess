Example 254
3-chloro-4-methyl-6-oxo-6H-pyridazine-1-yl-methyl 2,2-dimethylpropionate
[0772]The compound of Example 253 (2.15 g) was dissolved in DMF (70 mL) in an argon atmosphere. To this solution, potassium carbonate (4.11 g) was added and the mixture was stirred at 40.degree. C. to 50.degree. C. for 20 min. The mixture was then allowed to warm to room temperature. Chloromethyl pivalate (2.60 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. Subsequently, the solvent was evaporated and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate. The solution was washed with saturated brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent was concentrated and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate:petroleum ether=3:7) to afford the title compound as a colorless powder (3.22 g).
