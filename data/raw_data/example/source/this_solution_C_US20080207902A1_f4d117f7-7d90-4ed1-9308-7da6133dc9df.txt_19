Example 103
4-acetyl-3-chloro-2-ethyl-7-iodo-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0369]The compound of Example 93 (3.48 g) was dissolved in acetone (40 mL) and water (20 mL). To this solution, p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (169 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred at 50.degree. C. to 70.degree. C. for 25 hours. Subsequently, the reaction was terminated by adding a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (3.48 g).
