[0138] Thereafter, the magnetization of a magnetic material of the second example having the magnetic thin film formed in this manner was measured by an SQUID. As a result, according to the second example, as shown in the table 1, the squareness ratio M.sub.r/M.sub.s was 0.65. Accordingly, it was confirmed that when, as the film-formation conditions, the applied magnetic field was 2 T, the coating liquid viscosity was 99 cP, and the applied period was substantially 30 minutes, the squareness ratio M.sub.r/M.sub.s became equal to or greater than 0.65, and the residual magnetization was improved in comparison with prior arts.
(3-4-4) First Comparative Example
[0139] Next, the .di-elect cons.-Al.sub.0.5Fe.sub.1.5O.sub.3 water slurry of 10 wt % and a PEG 500000 aqueous solution of 10 wt % were mixed together at a ratio by weight of 1:1. Water was added in this solution, and the addition of water was terminated when the solution viscosity became 164 cP, and the solution was taken as a coating liquid. A PET film was subjected to a so-called bar-coating by this coating liquid, and immediately dried for substantially 30 minutes at a room temperature in a superconducting magnet with an external magnetic field of 2 T, thereby producing a magnetic thin film.
[0140] Thereafter, the magnetization of a magnetic material of the first comparative example having the magnetic thin film formed in this manner was measured by an SQUID. As a result, according to the first comparative example, as shown in the table 1, the squareness ratio M.sub.r/M.sub.s was 0.59.
[0141] Accordingly, it was confirmed that when, as a film-formation condition, the coating liquid viscosity was 164 cP that was higher than those of the first and second examples, the squareness ratio M.sub.r/M.sub.s became equal to or smaller than 0.65, and the residual magnetization was insufficient. Hence, it became clear that a coating liquid viscosity of less than 100 cP is desirable as a film-formation condition.
