DETAILS OF THE INVENTION
In an embodiment of this invention, an alkyl aromatic, such as paraxylene and/or paratoluic acid, is oxidized in an acetic acid medium with molecular oxygen in the presence of a catalyst system containing bromine and one or more heavy metals such as cobalt, manganese and the like. Although this method is well-known in the art and is commercially used, the oxidation reaction results in impurities which must be removed or rendered colorless to obtain a fiber-grade terephthalic acid. The principal use of captive and non-captive terephthalic acid is and has been for the manufacture of high molecular weight polyesters for fiber and film manufacture.
From U.S. Pat. No. 3,584,039, it is known that fiber grade terephthalic acid can be prepared by purifying crude terephthalic acid by means of a reduction procedure. The process is essentially comprised of treating an aqueous solution of crude terephthalic acid with hydrogen in the presence of a supported or unsupported Group VIII metal catalyst wherein the metal and the support are insoluble in the solution under the working conditions. By this process, intermediate oxidation products, such as 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA) and other coloring impurities in terephthalic acid are reduced and form removable or colorless products. Purified terephthalic acid is then recovered by crystallization and dried.
Although the above procedure has various advantages, problems remain in that the acetic acid in the oxidation procedure needs to be substantially removed from the terephthalic acid before hydrogenation. Acetic acid can act as a poison for the hydrogenation catalyst, thus reducing catalyst life. The separation of the acetic acid from the terephthalic acid by centrifugation, or filtration and drying can involve loss of the acetic acid unless acetic acid recovery systems are utilized.
In the separation and hydrogenation of crude terephthalic acid from acetic acid, see EPO 321 272 A1, one method that has been employed is to exchange a dispersing medium containing the crude crystals of terephthalic acid from an oxidation reaction medium of acetic acid, by using a multi-stage column to disperse the crude crystals in water to obtain an aqueous slurry of terephthalic acid containing 0.03 parts by weight of acetic acid, 30,000 ppmw. The aqueous slurry can be hydrogenated by contact with hydrogen gas to improve the solubility of the impurities and to remove the impurities by dissolution into the solvent. In the process of this method, residual slurry acetic acid is greater than 5000 ppmw.
