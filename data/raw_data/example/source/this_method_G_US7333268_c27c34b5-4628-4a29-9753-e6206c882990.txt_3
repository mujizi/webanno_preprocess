Icons formed from shaped voids and their inverse, icons formed from shaped posts, are particularly enabling for adding machine-readable authentication features to a Unison material security thread for currency and other high value documents. The icon matrix, the icon fill, and any number of back coats (sealing coats) can all, separately and/or in all combinations, incorporate non-fluorescing pigments, non-fluorescing dyes, fluorescing pigments, fluorescing dyes, metal particles, magnetic particles, nuclear magnetic resonance signature materials, lasing particles, organic LED materials, optically variable materials, evaporated metal, thin film interference materials, liquid crystal polymers, optical upconversion and downconversion materials, dichroic materials, optically active materials (possessing optical rotary power), optically polarizing materials, and other allied materials.
In some circumstances, such as when a dark or colored coating (such as a magnetic material or conductive layer) has been added to a Unison material or when the color of the icon plane is objectionable when seen through the back side of a substrate, it may be desirable to mask or hide the appearance of an embedded, partially embedded, or windowed Unison material security thread from one side of a paper substrate as seen in reflected light, while the thread is visible from the opposite side of the substrate. Other types of currency security threads commonly incorporate a metal layer, typically aluminum, to reflect light that filters through the surface substrate, thereby providing similar brightness to the surrounding substrate. Aluminum or other color neutral reflecting metal can be used in similar manner to mask the appearance of a Unison thread from the back side of a paper substrate by applying the metal layer on the back surface of the Unison material and then optionally sealing it in place. A pigmented layer can be utilized for the same purpose, that of hiding or obscuring the visibility of the security thread from the "back" side of the document, in place of a metallized layer, or in conjunction with it. The pigmented layer can be of any color, including white, but the most effective color is one that matches the color and intensity of the light internally scattered within, and outside of, the fibrous substrate.
The addition of a metallized layer to a Unison material can be accomplished in a number of ways, including direct metallization of the icon or sealing layer of the Unison material by evaporation, sputtering, chemical deposition, or other suitable means, or lamination of the icon or sealing layer of the Unison material to the metallized surface of a second polymer film. It is common practice to create currency security threads by metallizing a film, pattern demetallizing this film to leave narrow `ribbons` of metallized area, laminating the metallized surface to a second polymer film, then slitting the laminated material such that the metal ribbons are isolated from the edges of the slit threads by the laminating adhesive, thereby protecting the metal from chemical attack at the edges of the thread. This method can also be applied in the case of the subject invention: the Unison material can simply replace the second laminating film. Thus a Unison material can be augmented by the addition of patterned or unpatterned metallized layers.
Synthetic images can be designed as binary patterns, having one color (or absence of color) defining the icons and a different color (or absence of color) defining the background; in this case each icon zone includes a complete single-tone image that utilizes image `pixels` that are either full on or full off. More sophisticated synthetic images can be produced by providing tonal variations of the selected icon color. The synthetic image tonal variation can be created by controlling the density of the color in each icon image or by effectively `half-toning` the synthetic image by including or excluding design elements in selected groups of icons.
The first method, controlling the density of the color in each icon image, may be accomplished by controlling the optical density of the material creating the microprinted icon image. One convenient method to do this utilizes the filled void icon embodiment, already described previously.
