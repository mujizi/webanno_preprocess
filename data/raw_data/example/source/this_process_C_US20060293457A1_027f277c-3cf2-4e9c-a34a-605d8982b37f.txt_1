[0067] With reference now to FIGS. 6 and 7, screws (14B and 14A), which can be used for dynamic cross-linking, comprise mixing elements designed, together with the RPM used, the feed rate of the materials, and the physical properties of the materials, to provide shear and mixing that produces a temperature profile and residence times suitable for cross-linking.
[0068] With reference now to FIG. 8, an atomic force microscope image of a thermoplastic vulcanizate of the invention is shown. The thermoplastic vulcanizate (40) shows a good distribution of small rubber particles (36) in a continuous phase thermoplastic polymer (38). Although rubber particles (36) are thermoset and are fully cross linked, their dispersion in thermoplastic polymer (38) makes it possible for thermoplastic vulcanizate (40) to be reheated and shaped for final production, elimination of scrim, and eventual recycling, without loss of mechanical properties.
[0069] In the processing of thermoplastic elastomer blends, especially those blends containing a majority of elastomer, in the early stages of mixing, as the two ingredients are melted together, the lower temperature-melting elastomer comprises a continuous phase of a dispersion containing the thermoplastic polymer. As the cross-linking of the elastomer takes place, the cured elastomer is gradually immersed into the molten thermoplastic polymer and eventually becomes a discontinuous phase, dispersed in a continuous phase of thermoplastic polymer. This process is referred to as phase inversion, and if the phase inversion does not take place, the thermoplastic polymer may be trapped in the cross-linked rubber network of the extruded vulcanizate such that the extrudate created will be unusable for fabricating a thermoplastic product.
[0070] In the prior art, for most applications, the practical lower limit of thermoplastic polymer required for phase inversion to take place was considered to be greater than about 18.6% by weight of the total weight of the thermoplastic polymer and elastomer. Softer materials can be produced by using softer thermoplastic polymers, such as syndiotactic polypropylene or lower melting semi-crystalline polypropylene or polyethylene copolymers. The thermoplastic vulcanizates produced using these materials, however, have lower Tm or Tg, sometimes well below 135.degree. C. reducing service temperature tolerance for certain uses (e.g., underhood automobile applications), and may be tacky so as to interfere with or render difficult packaging and handling, and may bleed oil, thereby limiting their application in products.
[0071] In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that it is possible, by reducing the amount of thermoplastic polymer used in the thermoplastic vulcanizate composition, to produce very soft materials using high modulus or highly crystalline thermoplastic polymers, wherein high service temperature use is not compromised, and a clean (non-bleeding), non-tacky extrudate product, even after pelletization, is provided. The very soft composition can contain process oil relative to thermoplastic in the rate ratio of 160:1 to 7:1 and more preferably 113:1 to 13:1.
