[0682] The discussion above pertains to methods of gathering biometric data, such as fingerprints or palm prints using a platen or touch screen, as shown in FIGS. 66 and 62-66. This disclosure also includes methods and systems for touchless or contactless fingerprinting using polarized light. In one embodiment, fingerprints may be taken by persons using a polarized light source and retrieving images of the fingerprints using reflected polarized light in two planes. In another embodiment, fingerprints may be taken by persons using a light source and retrieving images of the fingerprints using multispectral processing, e.g., using two imagers at two different locations with different inputs. The different inputs may be caused by using different filters or different sensors/imagers. Applications of this technology may include biometric checks of unknown persons or subjects in which the safety of the persons doing the checking may be at issue.
[0683] In this method, an unknown person or subject may approach a checkpoint, for example, to be allowed further travel to his or her destination. As depicted in the system 6700 shown in FIG. 67, the person P and an appropriate body part, such as a hand, a palm P, or other part, are illuminated by a source of polarized light 6701. As is well known to those with skill in optical arts, the source of polarized light may simply be a lamp or other source of illumination with a polarizing filter to emit light that is polarized in one plane. The light travels to the person in an area which has been specified for non-contact fingerprinting, so that the polarized light impinges on the fingers or other body part of the person P. The incident polarized light is then reflected from the fingers or other body part and passes in all directions from the person. Two imagers or cameras 6704 receive the reflected light after the light has passed through optical elements such as a lens 6702 and a polarizing filter 6703. The cameras or imagers may be mounted on the augmented reality glasses, as discussed above with respect to FIG. 8F.
[0684] The light then passes from palm or finger or fingers of the person of interest to two different polarizing filters 6704a, 6704b and then to the imagers or cameras 6705. Light which has passed through the polarizing filters may have a 90.degree. orientation difference (horizontal and vertical) or other orientation difference, such as 30.degree., 45.degree., 60.degree. or 120.degree.. The cameras may be digital cameras with appropriate digital imaging sensors to convert the incident light into appropriate signals. The signals are then processed by appropriate processing circuitry 6706, such as digital signal processors. The signals may then be combined in a conventional manner, such as by a digital microprocessor with memory 6707. The digital processor with appropriate memory is programmed to produce data suitable for an image of a palm, fingerprint, or other image as desired. The digital data from the imagers may then be combined in this process, for example, using the techniques of U.S. Pat. No. 6,249,616 and others. As noted above in the present disclosure, the combined "image" may then be checked against a database to determine an identity of the person. The augmented reality glasses may include such a database in the memory, or may refer the signals data elsewhere 6708 for comparison and checking.
[0685] A process for taking contactless fingerprints, palm prints or other biometric prints is disclosed in the flowchart of FIG. 68. In one embodiment, a polarized light source is provided 6801. In a second step 6802, the person of interest and the selected body part is positioned for illumination by the light. In another embodiment, it may be possible to use incident white light rather than using a polarized light source. When the image is ready to be taken, light is reflected 6803 from the person to two cameras or imagers. A polarizing filter is placed in front of each of the two cameras, so that the light received by the cameras is polarized 6804 in two different planes, such as in a horizontal and vertical plane. Each camera then detects 6805 the polarized light. The cameras or other sensors then convert the incidence of light into signals or data 6806 suitable for preparation of images. Finally, the images are then combined 6807 to form a very distinct, reliable print. The result is an image of very high quality that may be compared to digital databases to identify the person and to detect persons of interest.
[0686] It should be understood that while digital cameras are used in this contactless system, other imagers may be used, such as active pixel imagers, CMOS imagers, imagers that image in multiple wavelengths, CCD cameras, photo detector arrays, TFT imagers, and so forth. It should also be understood that while polarized light has been used to create two different images, other variations in the reflected light may also be used. For example, rather than using polarized light, white light may be used and then different filters applied to the imagers, such as a Bayer filter, a CYGM filter, or an RGBE filter. In other embodiments, it may be possible to dispense with a source of polarized light and instead use natural or white light rather than a source of polarized light.
