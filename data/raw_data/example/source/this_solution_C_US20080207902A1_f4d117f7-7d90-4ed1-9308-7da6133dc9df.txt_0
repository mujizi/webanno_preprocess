[0154]In Synthetic Pathway J, the compound represented by the following general formula (45):
[wherein R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and X are as defined above] can be produced by reacting the compound represented by the general formula (44) with MSH (Step J-2).
[0155]Specifically, the compound represented by the general formula (44) is dissolved in an organic solvent such as THF, DMF, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene or methylene chloride. This solution is reacted with a solution of MSH in methylene chloride at 0.degree. C. to room temperature. This is followed by addition of an inorganic base, such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, or MSH. Palladium chloride in acetonitrile is then added and the reaction mixture is refluxed to obtain the desired compound.
[0156]In Synthetic Pathway J, the compound represented by the following general formula (46):
[wherein R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are as defined above] can be produced by adding a metal to the compound represented by the general formula (45) and reacting the resulting product with the compound represented by the following general formula (49):
