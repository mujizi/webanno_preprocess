[1075] The conductive microelectrode 1003 and the second conductive microelectrode 1004 make up a microelectrode pair. The microelectrode pairs, in one embodiment, were created from a thin film layer of gold that, in some embodiments, may be pre-primed with a layer of titanium. The thin film layer of gold, in one embodiment, was placed on a thermally oxidized silicon wafer and the microelectrodes were formed using thin film deposition and photolithography techniques commonly known to those skilled in the art.
[1076] In some embodiments, nanoelectrodes 1020 are connected to the microelectrode 1003 and the second microelectrode 1004 to enable direct electrical contact between an individual microtubule 1015 and both the microelectrode 1003 and the second microelectrode 1004. In one embodiment, a plurality of nanoelectrodes 1020 extend into the channel 1013, forming a hair-like array. The nanoelectrodes 1020 increase the probability that the microtubules 1015 will make ohmic contact with the microelectrode 1003 and the second microelectrode 1004. The nanoelectrodes 1020 may be manufactured using a technique such as Electron Beam-induced Deposition (EBD). The nanoelectrodes 1020 may, in other embodiments, be manufactured using the process described in this specification and illustrated by way of FIG. 30. The nanoelectrodes 1020 may, in some embodiments, be fabricated using catalyst pattern techniques such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,831,017 entitled CATALYST PATTERNING FOR NANOWIRE DEVICES. Other methods may be used, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,843,902 entitled METHODS FOR FABRICATING METAL NANOWIRES. The microelectrode 1003 and the second microelectrode 1004 form a channel 1013. The channel 1013 may be formed entirely from the geometries of the microelectrode 1003 and the second microelectrode 1004 in some embodiments. In other embodiments, the channel 1013 may be formed from a microelectrode 1003, a second microelectrode 1004 and additional geometries, for example, a well formed into a microstructured substrate such as silicon. A well is commonly known to one skilled in the art of microelectronics and microelectronic device design as an area depressed into a substrate such as silicon that may at times contain material that differs from the material of the surrounding substrate. A well is etched in, for example, a silicon substrate using proportions of HNO3, HF, CH3COOH and water. Other fabrication techniques may use anisotropic etching with etchants such as KOH and Hydrazine hydrate. In some embodiments, specific geometries of wells are formed by selective etching using resistive coatings to prevent the etching of the surrounding substrate. The depth of the well can be controlled by varying the strength of the etchant and the exposure time of the etchant to the substrate. In some embodiments, a sublayer of chrome silicon is sputter deposited to serve as an etch stop. The chrome silicon may, in some embodiments, be a ratio of 40% chrome and 60% silicon. The channel width for the purpose of this disclosure is defined as the spacing between the microelectrode 1003 and the second microelectrode 1004. The channel width may be varied to achieve the desired electrical characteristics at the drain 1009 and the source 1011. The drain 1009 and the source 1011 refer to terminals of the microtubule based switching device that indicate direction of current flow. Current flows from Drain 1009 to Source 1011. The channel 1013 may contain microtubules 1015 in a solution such as tubulin. The microtubules may, in some embodiments, be conductive. Conductive microtubules are known to those skilled in the art. As is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,452,564, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification, " . . . these microtubules are preferably a system of biologically-derived, high-aspect ratio, rods or tubules of microscopic dimensions, and are made electrically conductive by electroless plating . . . ."
[1077] Preparation of conductive microtubules of U.S. Pat. No. 6,452,564 is described in the paragraph beginning at line 51 of column 4, wherein it is disclosed that: "The microtubules are based on research done a number of years ago, wherein researchers at the Naval Research Laboratories in Washington, D.C., discovered particles with the size and shape appropriate for percolation. These microtubules are biologically derived, hollow organic cylinders of half-micron diameter and lengths of tens to hundreds of microns. The cylinders are coated with metal to render them conductive by an electroless process. Once metallized, the microtubules can be dried to a powder and dispersed into polymer matrices at varying loading densities to form the composite. In a preferred embodiment, the microtubules are formed from diacetylenic lipid (1,2 bis(tricosa-10, 12-diynoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), or DC8,9PC. See, for example, A. N. Lagarkov and A. K. Sarychev, Phys. Rev. B 53, 6318 (1996) and F. Behroozi, M. Orman, R. Reese, W. Stockton, J. Calvert, F. Rachfold and P. Schoen, J. Appl. Phys. 68, 3688 (1990). The lipid is dissolved in alcohol at 50.degree. C., water is added, and the temperature lowered to room temperature. The lipid self-assembles itself into microtubules and subsequently precipitates. The particles are rinsed and coated with a palladium catalyst and mixed with metal ions and reductants. In contact with the catalyst, the metal ions-are reduced to neutral metal on the surface of the microtubules and coat the structure with a conductive layer of metal of several tenths of a micron thickness. Several metal species are available for use in this process, but nickel and copper appear to be of greatest potential usefulness for the present invention."
[1078] The microtubules of U.S. Pat. No. 6,452,564 have a substantially uniform conductivity over their entire surface, such conductivity being substantially equal to the conductivity of the metal used to coat the surface.
[1079] The microtubules 1015 may, in some embodiments, be coated with a resistive material such as tantalum or nichrome (NiCr). In other embodiments, the microtubules may be coated with a magnetic material. The channel 1013 may, in some embodiments, contain several different types of microtubules. Microtubule types may, in some embodiments, include variations in both the biological and the electrical characteristics of microtubules.
