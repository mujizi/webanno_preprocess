The first master 10 is then separated from the light transmitting layer 30 as shown in FIG. 7(C). The light transmitting layer 30 has a plurality of color recesses 36 formed by the plurality of color protrusions 12 in the first master 10.
The color recesses 36 are then filled with a predetermined pigment 62 to form a color pattern layer 220 as shown in FIG. 8(A). This operation is described in detail in the first embodiment above, and further description is therefore omitted here.
A color pattern layer 220 is thus formed on the light transmitting layer 30 as shown in FIG. 8(B). The color pattern layer 220 side of the light transmitting layer 30 and a first reinforcing layer 240 are then bonded with a third light transmitting layer precursor 232 disposed therebetween. This process is the same as that used for bonding by way of intervening light transmitting layer precursor 32, and the light transmitting layer precursor 232 can also be selected from any of the materials usable for the light transmitting layer precursor 32, in the first embodiment.
A third light transmitting layer 230 as shown in FIG. 9(A) is formed by thus spreading the third light transmitting layer precursor 232 and then applying an appropriate setting process.
The third master 200 is then separated from the second light transmitting layer 210 as shown in FIG. 9(B). The light blocking recess 214 transferred from the light blocking protrusion 202 of the third master 200 is thus formed on the second light transmitting layer 210.
