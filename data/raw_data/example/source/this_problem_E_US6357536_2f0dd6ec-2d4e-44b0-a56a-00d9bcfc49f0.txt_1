As noted above, one of the primary functions of the drilling fluid 120 is the control of the formation pressure. The hydrostatic pressure exerted by the mud column 180 is maintained above the pressure of the formation 170. This is controlled by the density of the drilling fluid 120. Drilling fluids also contain a variety of additives. Drilling fluids are selected based on the desired characteristics relating to the density, viscosity, cutting carrying capacity, corrosion resistance, etc. Both water-based and oil-based drilling fluids are used depending upon the specific application. If the formation pressure exceeds the pressure exerted by the mud column 180, formation fluid 182 may enter the wellbore 110, causing a kick, which is any unscheduled entry of formation fluid into the wellbore 100. This results in a gain in the flow rate of the returning fluid 126. Additionally, the drilling fluid may incur losses due to the presence of a fracture in the formation 170, such as fracture 184. This results in loss of the drilling fluid, which results in a loss of the fluid flow rate at the surface. Monitoring of the flow rate of fluids entering and exiting the wellbore is accomplished with sensors 155 and 160a-160c.
As noted above, other key functions of the drilling fluid 120 keeping the wellbore 110 clean by removing cuttings 124, especially in extended reach wells, because cuttings accumulation in the annulus can contribute to, if not directly cause, pipe sticking and twist-offs. This is a concern when drilling a deviated well since a bed of cuttings is almost always formed on the lower side of the drill pipe. By measuring the cuttings discharge at the surface, the buildup of cuttings in the well can be detected early and remedial action taken to prevent a catastrophic failure.
Another obstacle encountered in drilling operations, as noted above, is washout. Washout is excessive enlargement of wellbore 110 caused by solvent and erosion action by the drilling fluid 120. Washout can cause severe damage to the formation, contaminate the connate formation fluids, and waste costly drilling mud. Early detection through the measurement of cuttings 124 exiting the wellbore 110 can also help mitigate this problem. The novelty of the present invention is that highly accurate and inexpensive measurements of pressure differentials in this relatively homogeneous returning fluid 122 including cuttings 124 can be made at the riser 128. This measurement can lead to the early detection of washouts and hole cleaning problems.
Mounted on the riser 128 weight-out sensor 165 are preferably two pressure sensors P2 and P1. These sensors are spaced vertically approximately two meters apart and are in communication with the returning fluid 126 so that the pressure exerted by the returning fluid can be detected and measured. Preferably, the sensors would have a measuring accuracy of 0.01% F.S. or better. The pressure sensors P2 and P1 convert the measured pressure to an electrical signal. This signal is then conveyed by conductors 165a and 165b to a processor 166 that performs an evaluation to determine the density of the returning fluid including cuttings 124.
The dynamic pressure losses over a length interval of approximately two meters can be neglected. The measured pressure values can be evaluated to determine a highly accurate mud out weight including the cuttings 124. Referring now to schematic in FIG. 2, with the measured pressures P1, P2, the known vertical separation h of the sensors, and g being the earth gravitational force the mud weight out n can be calculated by processor 166 with equation 1. ##EQU1##
