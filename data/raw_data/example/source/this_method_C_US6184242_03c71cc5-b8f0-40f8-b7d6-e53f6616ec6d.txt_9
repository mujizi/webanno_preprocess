In step 1, a heterocyclylmethyl-phenylamine 34 is prepared by reducing the aromatic and nitro groups of a heteroarylmethyl-nitrobenzene 33 by catalytic hydrogenation conditions, for example, a platinum or palladium catalyst (e.g., PtO.sub.2 or Pd/C, preferably 10% Pd/C) in a protic organic solvent such as acidic methanol or acidic ethanol, preferably acidic ethanol. The reaction proceeds at a temperature of about 20.degree. to 100.degree. C. at about 20-100 psi pressure.
In step 2, a phenylamine compound of formula Ij is prepared by reacting compound 34 with an isocyanate/thioisocyanate in an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane, diethylamine, or tetrahydrofuran. The reaction proceeds under an inert atmosphere at about -10.degree. to 30.degree. C.
An exemplary preparation of a compound of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compound of formula Ij is described in detail in Example 18.
Scheme K
Scheme K describes an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 represented by formula (C) where X is N, and R.sup.6 is --COR.sup.9 or --SO.sub.2 R.sup.9, ing intermediate compound of formula Ik. ##STR19##
