[0008] Meanwhile, in a manufacturing process of a printed circuit board, a process of forming various via holes such as an inner via hole (IVH), a blind via hole (BVH), and a plated through hole (PTH) for electrically connecting between a circuit pattern and an electronic element of each layer is needed. In the prior art, a printed circuit board is manufactured by forming a via hole in an insulator, plating the inside of the via hole to form a via, and forming a circuit pattern including a pad on a surface of the insulator when the via for interlayer electrical connection is formed.
[0009] However, in order to respond to a demand for high density and thinning of a printed circuit board, high-density interlayer connection and a fine circuit should be implemented by reducing the size of the pad and the via formed under the pad, but when forming a printed circuit board according to the prior art, there is a limitation in reducing the size of the via. That is, when simply reducing the size of the via, there is a difficulty in completely plating the via or processing the small via since an aspect ratio, a ratio of height to size (diameter) of the via, is increased.
[0010] In order to overcome this problem, a technology for reducing a size of a via without increasing an aspect ratio is needed. In the prior art, since a thin insulator should be used to uniformly maintain an aspect ratio, there is a limitation on the type of available substrates. Due to this, there is difficulty in developing various products.
[0011] Further, a lot of costs and efforts are needed to develop a technology of plating a via and a technology of processing a small via.
