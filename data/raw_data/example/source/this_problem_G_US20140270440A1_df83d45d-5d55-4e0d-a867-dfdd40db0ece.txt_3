[0063] One drawback of typical photon-counting image detectors is their relatively small size. Unlike a conventional digital radiography imaging panel that has an array with hundreds of elements in the height and width directions, the photon-counting sensor is typically of smaller size, with a width that may be fewer than 100 pixels in dimension. This problem can be addressed by tiling, an approach in which multiple image detectors are combined to cover a larger detection area. The use of polycrystalline materials, as opposed to conventional monocrystalline detector materials as noted earlier, can also help to provide larger detectors.
[0064] Another solution for the size constraints of photon-counting image detectors adapts their scanning sequence to effectively increase the field of view. In practice, this size limitation requires a different scanning sequence from that used for conventional CBCT imaging. A helical scan can be used to acquire the needed image data for volume imaging. In operation, mount 130 rotates about the head of patient 12 multiple times, thereby scanning sensor 121 about patient 12 in a helical orbit, as is shown in FIG. 8. In FIG. 8, an adjacent imaging position is shown in dotted outline, with the angular distance exaggerated for clarity. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the vertical height h change of the helix during revolution of the source and detector, which can also be expressed in terms of the helical pitch angle P, and angular change .theta. between successive image acquisitions, is adjustable.
[0065] The helical scan needed for CBCT imaging using a photon-counting sensor 121 can be provided following either of a number of scanning apparatus models. FIGS. 9A and 9B show a first approach to this problem, in which mount 130 that contains sensor 121 and source 110 is itself coupled to a movable travel arm 128 that is vertically translated during the scan, displaced by an actuator 122 during rotation of mount 130. This translation changes the relative vertical position of the imaging sensor and the radiation source to the patient's head during the helical scan. In one embodiment for the helical scan, an imaging sensor can be a slit shaped sensor with the longest dimension configured to extend during the scan in a direction that is perpendicular to the helix axis.
[0066] FIGS. 10A and 10B show a second approach to this problem, in which mount 130 itself has the same height, while source 110 and sensor 121 are vertically translated during the helical scan, thereby changing the relative vertical position of the imaging sensor and the radiation source to the patient's head during the helical scan. FIGS. 11A and 11B show a third approach to this problem, in which mount 130 itself has the same height, while a vertically adjustable platform 138 is used as an actuator to provide relative movement between the head of the patient and source 110 and sensor 121 for changing the relative vertical position of the imaging sensor and the radiation source to the patient's head during the helical scan.
[0067] As shown in FIGS. 9A-11B, one or more actuators 124 within mount 130, or other height adjustment devices provide this vertical translation function as source 110 and sensor 121 revolve about the patient's head. Computer 106 coordinates and tracks the vertical and rotational or angular movement and corresponding actuators needed for helical scanning. Sensor 134 provides feedback information on height with the FIG. 9A/B, FIG. 10A/B and FIG. 11A/B scan configurations.
