[0012] There are three serious limitations of partial container-vacuum systems, either or all, of which are characteristic of the prior art devices:
[0013] 1. Devices which initiate the development of the partial vacuum after the fuel level reaches the vent tube entrance level can, and do, allow serious overfill spillage when the volume of air left in the container is large. Boyle's gas law states that in a closed system, at constant temperature, the absolute pressure of a gas, multiplied by its volume, is a constant. Application of this principle reveals that, when a gallon or more of fuel has been poured from the container, the volume of vapor and air mixture remaining in the container must be expanded as much as 5 to 8 cubic inches before a partial vacuum capable of stopping the flow of fuel is developed. This is especially true when an initial volume of vapor and air in the container, in addition to that of the poured fuel, is accounted for. This expansion requires an equal volume of fuel flow, and is a major reason why many of the prior-art devices fail to control spillage.
[0014] 2. Attempts to avoid this problem by restricting the rate of vapor and air flow to the container while refueling, and thus to develop and maintain the partial vacuum during the entire time when the fuel is flowing, suffer from a different but equally annoying problem. Restriction of vapor and air flow to the container during refueling necessarily reduces the rate of fuel flow from the container. This slows refueling and is very tiring to a user holding the heavy container in an awkward position. Tests have revealed a flow rate as low as one gallon a minute with this type of device which is a burden when refueling a large garden tractor.
[0015] 3. Open-system devices, which fail to seal the tank from the atmosphere, allow the vapor to follow the path of least resistance and, since it is lighter than air, it is free to move upward and out of the tank while the heavier air can move downward into the vicinity of the vent tube. This is even more likely to happen on a windy day, with the result that much of the air entering the vent tube may be atmospheric air rather than gasoline-vapor laden air. It is axiomatic that any vapor volume which is not allowed to return to the container must escape to the atmosphere with an open-system, sacrificing much of the initial purpose of the device. All of the prior art devices are open-system devices and thus fail under this criterion.
[0016] U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,487 to Thiermann et al was one device with which a flow rate of only one gallon per minute was recorded during tests. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,834,151, 5,076,333, 5,249,611, and 5,419,378 to Law rely upon a capillary to restrict vapor flow to the container, yet these fail to prevent spills even with the restricted vapor flow and resulting decreased fuel flow rate. U.S. Pat. No. 6,318,604 to Messner et al is also an open-system device. It is axiomatic that any vapor volume which is not allowed to return to the container must escape to the atmosphere with an open system, sacrificing part of the initial purpose.
