Example 138
4-butyryl-7-methoxy-2-trifluoromethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0461]The compound of Example 136 (265 mg) was dissolved in dichloromethane (5.00 mL). To this solution, activated manganese dioxide (801 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. Subsequently, a second portion of activated manganese dioxide (801 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 hours. A third portion of activated manganese dioxide (801 mg) was then added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10.5 hours. Finally, a fourth portion of activated manganese dioxide (400 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred for 13.5 hours. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and the filtrate was evaporated to afford the title compound as a pale yellow powder (174 mg).
