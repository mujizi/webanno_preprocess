[0033] The refrigerant is expediently guided in the motor housing, when seen in the direction of the central axis, such that it flows through the drive motor from the first winding head in the direction of a second winding head.
[0034] In order to guide the refrigerant as favorably as possible it is provided for the refrigerant to exit from the motor housing at the level of the second winding head when seen in the direction of the central axis.
[0035] With this solution it is not described in greater detail where the first winding head and the second winding head are located.
[0036] With one inventive solution, the first winding head is arranged such that this is the winding head of the drive motor which is located on a side facing away from the first bearing member whereas in another embodiment the winding head is the winding head of the drive motor which is located on a side facing the first bearing member.
[0037] With respect to the guidance of oil separating in the motor housing to the oil sump, no further details have so far been given. One advantageous solution provides, for example, for oil separating in the motor housing to exit from the motor housing through oil discharge openings of a second bearing member which forms a base of the motor housing in order to reach the oil sump.
