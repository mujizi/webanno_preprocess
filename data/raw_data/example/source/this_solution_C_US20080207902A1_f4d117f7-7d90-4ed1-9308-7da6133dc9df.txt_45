2-benzyl-6-chloro-2H-pyridazine-3-one
[0776]6-chloro-2H-pyridazine-3-one (3.50 g) was dissolved in DME (130 mL). To this solution, cesium carbonate (17.5 g) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min in an argon atmosphere. Subsequently, benzyl bromide (4.00 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3.5 hours. The insoluble inorganic residue was removed by filtration and the filtrate was concentrated. Water was then added to the residue and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, washed with saturated brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated and the resulting crystals were recrystallized from ethyl acetate/petroleum ether to afford the title compound as a pale yellow powder (4.94 g).
