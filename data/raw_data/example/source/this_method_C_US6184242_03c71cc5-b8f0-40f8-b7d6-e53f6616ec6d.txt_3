Alternatively, route (b) describes the preparation of a compound of Formula Id where R.sup.3 is a sulfonamide group, in particular where m is an integer 0:
In general, a compound of formula Id' is prepared by utilizing the reaction conditions previously described in Scheme C, route (b), but the 4,4'-methylenedianiline 12 is reacted with an acylating agent such as a acyl halide to give a compound of formula Id'. Then optionally, a compound of formula Id can be prepared by further alkylating the compound of formula Id' with a suitable alkylating agent in the presence of a strong base such as potassium tert-butoxide. Suitable solvents include aprotic organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the like, preferably dimethyl sulfoxide.
An exemplary preparation of a compound of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compound of formula Id is described in Example 7.
Scheme E
Scheme E describes an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 is a group represented by formula (A) and R.sup.3 is --(CH.sub.2).sub.m NR.sup.7 C(V)NR.sup.8 R9 where V is S or O, from the corresponding intermediate compounds of formula Ie. ##STR13##
