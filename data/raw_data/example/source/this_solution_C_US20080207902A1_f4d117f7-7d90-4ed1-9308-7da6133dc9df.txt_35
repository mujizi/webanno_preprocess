Example 188
2-ethyl-6-fluoro-4-(2-bromopropionyl)-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0566]The compound of Example 73 (460 mg) was dissolved in ethyl acetate (46 mL) in an argon atmosphere. To this solution, copper (II) bromide (1.03 g) was added and the mixture was stirred for 5 hours under reflux. Subsequently, the reaction was terminated by adding water at 0.degree. C. and the mixture was filtered through Celite. The filtrate was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure and purification by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=10:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (540 mg).
