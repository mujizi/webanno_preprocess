For the purposes of this description, the term "composite yarn" can be defined as a yarn having at least some fusible/meltable/shrinkable filaments at a predetermined temperature and some substantially non-fusible/meltable/shrinkable filaments at the same predetermined temperature. While both sets of filaments may exhibit shrinkage and melting at the given temperature, the effect is significantly more pronounced, and leads to the desired effect primarily in the fusible/meltable/shrinkable filaments. The other filaments act, conversely, to moderate the effect.
In practice, the composite yarn, upon heating exhibits some degree of shrinkage and some degree of flow via melting so that it fuses to the warp and to the wire and also pulls the warps in a given cluster together. After cooling, the structure is more-tightly bound to the wire, but the use of polyester in the overall composite matrix of the yarn prevents uncontrolled shrinkage that would tend to deform the carrier.
The use of a composite yarn also allows for additional manufacture steps in certain circumstances. For example, in certain manufacturing processes, additional heating steps may be applied after initial formation of the wire carrier, such heating steps may be before or during application of elastomeric seal material to the carrier. The heat-activated yarn may be overheated by such processes or less-desirable, than a composite thread that may form a more-secure structure due to its ability to absorb multiple heating steps. Similarly, in an alternate manufacture process, the composite yarn may remain unheated until just before application of seal elastomer. In this process, heat is applied, the yarn partially melts and elastomer is then applied. The entire finished weather seal unit is then allowed to cool.
FIG. 5 details another embodiment of this invention in which the wire carrier 510 includes a zigzag-bent wire 520 consisting of 180-degree rounded over ends 530 and parallel central segments 534. Thus, this arrangement lacks the propeller-shape of the previous embodiments (FIG. 1 and FIG. 3). Such a structure may be desirable in certain applications where the carrier strip is cut evenly across the width and the propeller shape may cause the central segment to be severed in two locations (owing to its non-parallel orientation). This can be undesirable, as it leaves an unconnected "island" of wire on one of the severed ends. In the arrangement of FIG. 5, the wire is always cut at only one point, so long as it is cut along its length somewhere between segments 534.
In the embodiment of FIG. 5, the wire 520 acts as the weft for three warp clusters 550, 552 and 554 as described generally above. A respective locking stitch 560, 562 and 564 is directed through the warp 550, 552 and 554. This warp can be composed of either (or both) a heat-activated or composite yarn as described above. The associated manufacturing processes for producing the carrier and seal follow one of the described set of steps above. The use of a locking stitch on the end warps 550 and 552 is particularly advantageous in this embodiment because there is no widened end region (spacing SA) to resist movement of the end warps 550 and 552 toward the center. The locking stitch provides such resistance.
