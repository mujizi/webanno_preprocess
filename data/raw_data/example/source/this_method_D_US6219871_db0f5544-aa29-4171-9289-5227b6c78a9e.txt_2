2. Water Extraction Method Breakthrough
It been found that if a plastic grocery bag is tied shut with articles of laundry and water inside, and a vacuum applied inside the bag, the grocery bag collapses due to atmospheric pressure. This collapse presses the water out of the articles of laundry inside the bag. Even more water is extracted by both mechanical and evaporative removal, when air is repeatedly allowed to re-enter the evacuated bag and the bag again evacuated. This method of water extraction is ideal for an automatic washing machine using a flexible bag for the washing container. The reduced atmospheric pressure at higher elevations may require artificial assistance. This reduced atmospheric pressure can be assisted easily by doubling the bag such that one bag is inside the other. Supplemental air pressure could be applied between the two bags to assist the atmospheric pressure in collapsing the inner bag, thus effectively wringing the water from the laundry. This method of supplemental air pressure may be used even at sea level if dryer laundry is desired. Thus, the spin cycle of prior art washing machines is eliminated.
With the spin cycle gone, the heavy parts requirement is gone. It may seem paradoxical that replacing big parts with small parts, metal with plastic and rigid with flexible, will improve the capacity and the cleaning properties of a washing machine. However, the result has been empirically verified. With this invention, less works better.
