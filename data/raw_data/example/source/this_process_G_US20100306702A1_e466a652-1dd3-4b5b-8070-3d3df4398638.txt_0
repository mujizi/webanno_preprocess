[0085] Some embodiments enable a user to select an item by using a cursor controller button or similar input with the cursor over the item either in addition to or instead of gestural selection. For instance, a user can click (or double-click) a mouse button, tap (or double-tap) a touchpad, etc. to select an item. Similarly, in the case where the radial menu is presented on a touchscreen, a user can tap (or double-tap) the screen over a menu item in order to select the menu item.
[0086] If the selected menu item opens a submenu, the GUI transitions to state 940. In some embodiments, the sub-menu opening process is similar to the primary menu opening process, in that the menu items expand outwards from a central location. When the sub-menu is opened based on a mouse click or similar input, the central location for the sub-menu is the cursor location where the selection input is received in some embodiments. In other embodiments, the central location is the displayed icon representing the selected menu item that caused the sub-menu to open. Some such embodiments automatically move the cursor to this central location when the sub-menu is opened.
[0087] FIG. 12 illustrates the opening of a sub-menu 1250 in response to a selection of a menu item 1205 from a primary menu 1200 according to some embodiments. FIG. 12 illustrates this process in three stages, a first stage 1210 at which the menu item is selected, a second stage 1220 at which the sub-menu is fully opened and the cursor is over a menu cancellation button for the sub-menu, and a third stage 1230 at which the cursor is over one of the menu items of the sub-menu.
[0088] Stage 1210 illustrates primary menu 1200. Primary menu 1200 has numerous menu items, including menu item 1205, which is presently highlighted because cursor 615 is over item 1205. Furthermore, stage 1210 illustrates that a user has just clicked a cursor controller button with the cursor over item 1205.
[0089] Selection of menu item 1205 causes a sub-menu 1250 to open, as illustrated in stage 1220. Stage 1220 illustrates the sub-menu 1250 after the sub-menu has fully opened. The sub-menu opening process of some embodiments is similar to the primary menu opening process illustrated in FIG. 6, in that the icons representing the menu items expand outwards from the center to their assigned locations.
