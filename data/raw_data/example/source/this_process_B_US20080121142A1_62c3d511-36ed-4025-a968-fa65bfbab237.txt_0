[0130]In a preferred embodiment, use of the sorbents results in a cementitious ash that can replace portland cement in whole or in part in a variety of applications. Because of the re-use of the cementitious product, at least some portland cement manufacture is avoided, saving the energy required to make the cement, and avoiding the release of significant amounts of carbon dioxide which would have arisen from the cement manufacture. Other savings in carbon dioxide emissions result from the reduced need for lime or calcium carbonate in desulfurization scrubbers. The invention thus provides, in various embodiments, methods for saving energy and reducing green house emissions such as carbon dioxide. Further detail of various embodiments of this aspect of the invention are given below.
[0131]Portland cement is manufactured in a wet or a dry process kiln. While the wet and dry processes differ, both processes heat the raw material in stages. Cement manufacturing raw materials comprise sources of calcium, silica, iron, and alumina, and usually include limestone, as well as a variety of other materials, such as clay, sand, and/or shale, for example. The first stage is a pre-heating stage that drives off any moisture from the raw materials, removes water of hydration, and raises the material temperature up to approximately 1500.degree. F. The second stage is the calcination stage which generally occurs between about 1500.degree. F. and 2000.degree. F., where the limestone (CaCO.sub.3) is converted to lime (CaO) by driving off carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2) in a calcination reaction. The raw materials are then heated to a maximum temperature of between about 2500.degree. F. to 3000.degree. F. in the burning zone, where they substantially melt and flux, thus forming inorganic compounds, such as tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, tricalcium aluminate, and tetracalcium aluminoferrite. A typical analysis of portland cement products shows that they contain approximately 65-70% CaO, 20% SiO.sub.2, 5% Al.sub.2O.sub.3, 4% Fe.sub.2O.sub.3, with lesser amounts of other compounds, such as oxides of magnesium, sulfur, potassium, sodium, and the like. The molten raw material is cooled to solidify into an intermediate product in small lumps, known as "clinker" that is subsequently removed from the kiln. Clinker is then finely ground and mixed with other additives (such as a set-retardant, gypsum) to form portland cement. Portland cement can then be mixed with aggregates and water to form concrete.
[0132]Cement production is an energy sensitive process in which a combination of raw materials is chemically altered through intense heat to form a compound of binding properties. Cement manufacturing is the largest non-energy industrial source of carbon dioxide emissions. The emissions result from heating limestone, which constitutes approximately 80% of the feed to cement kilns. During cement production, high temperatures are used to transform the limestone into lime, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In this process, one molecule of calcium carbonate is decomposed into one molecule of carbon dioxide gas and one molecule of calcium oxide.
[0133]The cement manufacturer utilizes nearly 100% of the calcium oxide obtained from calcinated calcium carbonate. Thus, the amount of calcium oxide in the cement clinker is a good measure of the carbon dioxide produced during production. In an example, to estimate carbon dioxide emission from cement production, an emission factor is derived by multiplying the fraction of lime in the cement clinker by a constant that reflects the mass of carbon released per unit of lime. In one example, assuming an average lime content of 64.6% based on recommendations of the International Panel for Climate Control, an emissions factor of 0.138 tons of carbon per ton of clinker produced is obtained. Additional carbon dioxide may be released as a result of adding extra lime to make masonry cement, a more plastic cement that typically is used in mortar.
[0134]In cement making, carbon dioxide emissions result from energy use and from decomposition of calcium carbonate during clinker production. Depending on the fuel source that provides the energy, carbon dioxide emissions may vary. For example, the use of a cleaner burning fuel, such as natural gas, produces less carbon dioxide emissions than the use of a fuel such as coal. In various embodiments, the invention described above may be used in the production of cement. In such embodiments, the use of the invention in the production of cement will reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
