[0206] The microplatform was assembled in the following way. Sealing film with adhesive exposed was first applied to the upper surface of the macrofluidic layer so that it completely covered the holes and channels 207, 208, 211, 218. Final assembly was completed by forming a reversible, conforming seal between the PDMS microfluidics layer and the bottom surface of the microfluidic reservoir layer 201 made through simple physical contact of the two components. This seal is based on physical adhesion forces alone--van der Waals attraction forces and potentially static electrical charge present on the surfaces--and was sufficient to seal the disc against leakage due to the centripetally-induced pressures used.
[0207] The platform shown in FIG. 11 and prepared as described herein was used to perform simultaneously and in parallel 24 enzyme inhibition assays. Fluids were deposited in the reservoirs formed in reservoir layer 201 when reservoir layer is mated or bonded with microfluidics layer 500. Platform 100 is then rotated using a rotational profile designed to drive fluids through the channels within the macrofluidic disc 201 and the microfluidic disc 500.
[0208] The platform shown in FIG. 11 possesses the same features as that shown in FIGS. 1 through 6, and reference to features will be made those on the latter figures. It was used to perform 24 simultaneous enzyme inhibition assays as model homogeneous assays. In an enzyme inhibition assay, the effect of a compound present in a first fluid ("A") upon the capacity of an enzyme present in a second fluid (fluid "B") to catalyze a reaction, typically of a substrate in a third fluid ("C") is determined. The reaction was chosen to give a change in a readily-measured parameter of the fluid, such as its optical density, or to produce a fluorescent moiety. When no inhibitor was present in fluid A, mixing solution A with enzyme solutions had no effect: The enzyme activity detected in this assay was the maximum detected and provided the largest change in the measured parameter. However, if an inhibitor was present in fluid A, mixing fluid A with fluid B will, after a sufficient time resulted in a chemical reaction or other change induced by the inhibitor in most or all of the enzyme molecules, rendering them incapable of catalyzing the desired reaction. If this solution was mixed with the substrate solution, little or no change in the measured parameter was seen.
[0209] The system chosen to model homogeneous assays consisted of theophylline as inhibitor, alkaline phosphatase as the enzyme, and p-nitrophenol phosphate (PNPP) as the substrate. In the presence of alkaline phosphatase, PNPP, which is colorless, is converted to p-nitrophenol (PNP), which absorbs in the blue and therefore appears yellow. Theophylline was used in concentrations of 0.01 mM to 100 mM to provide a standard dose-response curve in the inhibitor. Alkaline phosphatase was used in a 1 mg/mL solution. PNPP was used as a 0.5 mM solution. All solutions were made in a buffer of 0.1 M glycine and 0.5 mM MgCl.sub.2 in deionized water.
[0210] The dimensions of the platform used for these assays were as follows. The overall platform diameter was 12 cm. The macrofluidic disc was about 1.6 mm thick. The diameter of the sample entry ports through-holes 204 was 0.5 mm; the depression 203 was conical, with an outer diameter of 2 mm and a depth of 1 mm, allowing the cones to "guide" the placement of pipette tips when loaded manually. The common reagent entry ports consisted here of only through holes 215 and 217, also of diameter 0.5 mm. The air ports 205 and 206 were also 0.5 mm in diameter. The reagent manifold through-hole 207 was also 0.5 mm in diameter, and the exit channel 208 was of larger diameter and depth of 0.43 mm. The exit channel narrowed to join the channel 209 of width 0.45 mm. The manifold 210 was also 0.43 mm deep and 0.45 mm wide. The vias 211 were 0.45 mm in diameter and penetrated through the macrofluidic disc from the top surface to the bottom surface. The terminal via 218 had a diameter of 0.53 mm and penetrated to the bottom surface of the layer.
