In the preferred embodiment of FIG. 1, a cutter 48 severs the calendared laminate to length to provide a sheet 50 of desirable length. A similarly shaped decorative cover layer 52 of woven fabric, permeable vinyl or impermeable vinyl is manually applied over the severed laminated sheet 50. It will be clear that the manual operation of depositing decorative layer 52 on severed sheet 50 may be mechanized if desired. The decorative layer 52 may or may not have an open celled foam layer as a backing between it and the second fiber glass layer 41.
The composite is then moved between a pair of molds 54, 56 which are brought together to heat and lightly compress the laminate to melt the adhesive film layers 24, 46 and set the thermosetting liquid resin 15 impregnating the foam layer 11. Thereby the heat freezes the layers in a shape conforming to the lower mold surface and the ultimate sequential bonding occurs as the laminate cools and liquid adhesive layers 24, 46 cool and harden.
Ordinarily the decorative sheet 52 is a sufficient barrier against any resin bleeding through web 46 reaching upper mold 54. Resin buildup on calender rollers 42, 44 and molds 54, 56 is highly undesirable because the resin is extremely difficult to remove. It may require wire brushing and the like and the act of wire brushing mars the surface of the roller or mold, making subsequent resin deposition even more likely. To combat this problem, rolls and molds are provided with a coating of baked on silicone. This allows any resin bleed through to be removed by solvent cleaning. Thereafter the rolls or molds may be re-sprayed with a new silicone layer.
FIG. 1 illustrates a steam nozzle cutting station 58 as one alternative embodiment, but it is within the contemplation of the invention to have an anvil and cutting blade (not shown) at the desired peripheral shape of the headliner to be incorporated as a part of the two mold elements 54, 56 such that, when the molds at a temperature in the range of about 275.degree.-375.degree. F. have cured the thermosetting resin 15 adequately for a period of 30-180 seconds, the molds 54, 56 may be pressed together to cause the knife to sever the peripheral edges of the headliner by engaging the anvil.
The thermosetting adhesive resin mixture 15 applied at 16 is about one-half polyether polyol, preferably in the range of about 50-60% by volume, about one-half aromatic isocyanate by volume with an appropriate catalyst if desired of about 0.0-0.2% by volume. Preferably the volume of isocyanate is in the range from about 40-50%. The resin mixture 15 should have an index of about one.
