Another object of the present invention is to reduce the time needed to couple the line and the receptacle and thus, increase the refuelling rotation.
One idea might be to use two video cameras placed one on each side of the aircraft. These cameras, which would observe the refuelling scene from two different angles, would allow the objects in the scene to be reconstructed in three dimensions. From this, the coordinates of the receptacle and of the end of the line could be deduced in a three-dimensional (3D) reference frame.
However, although this solution is envisageable for robotic applications in an industrial environment, it becomes extremely complicated to employ on an in-flight refuelling aircraft with the operating constraints involved, and this makes its performance uncertain.
One of the difficulties is that of locking on to and tracking two objects of the image which move independently causing these objects to be obscured. Another difficulty arises from the use of variable focal length cameras. This type of equipment is needed in order to be able to guarantee that both objects will be present in the images simultaneously, even taking account of any possible turbulence, and so as to allow a good level of accuracy in extracting their co-ordinates in three dimensions, particularly in the final phase of guiding the line onto the receptacle.
The use of two variable focal length cameras intended to perform a three-dimensional reconstruction is extremely complicated because it entails instantaneous and precise knowledge of the focal lengths, and requires the optical axes of the two cameras to be automatically controlled as a function of their focal length; this then entails them being installed on platforms which, given the ambient environment and the temperatures imposed by the high altitude (of the order of -55.degree. C.), is not simple.
