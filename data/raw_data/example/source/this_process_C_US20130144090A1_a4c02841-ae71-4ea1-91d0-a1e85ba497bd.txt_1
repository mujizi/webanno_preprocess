[0081] After hydrodeoxygenation of the organic product (obtained from the first step) over conventional hydrodeoxygenation catalyst, the oxygen content of the product decreased from 16% to 0.03%. The product did not contain any sulfur. The overall carbon distribution (including first and second stages) is shown in FIG. 12. About 60% of the carbon was present as C6+ hydrocarbons while 13% of carbon was present as pentane. The light gases from both stages included C1-C4 hydrocarbons and carbon oxides. About 13% of inlet carbon was converted to carbon oxides, which most likely is an overestimated number due to analytical limitations. The overall hydrogen consumption (for both stages) was about 1400-1500 scf/bbl, about 30-40% lower than a hydrodeoxygenation-based process.
[0082] The true boiling point curve of the finished product obtained from SIMDIS D2887 is shown in FIG. 11 along with the curve for intermediate product. After comparing the two boiling point curves, it appears that the nature of the curve for heavier molecules did not change indicating oxygen was present predominantly as C5-C6 oxygenates. The hydrocondensation process showed about 5% reduction in volume compared to hydrodeoxygenation-based process, mainly due to the production of higher density naphtha and distillates. The C5-C6 volumetric yield was 50% while diesel yield was 28%. These volumetric yields improve product value compared to a process that produces mostly light naphtha.
[0083] As seen earlier, the hydrocondensation-based process generates a product that has higher value compared to the hexane-pentane product mixture obtained from direct hydrodeoxygenation of feedstock in the presence of diesel process. Besides this, the hydrocondensation process also offers some cost saving opportunities. The process does not require a diesel co-feed and all capital and operating costs related to this can be eliminated. The hydrogen exiting the reactor mainly consists of carbon oxides and C1-C4 hydrocarbons. This hydrogen, after a small purge, can be recycled back to either sugar hydrogenation step or hydrotreating step. Also, the overall hydrogen consumption of this process is about 30-40% lower than the hydrodeoxygenation-based process. Because of these two reasons, the amount of fresh hydrogen required will be lower, which will decrease the cost of steam-methane reformer and may also improve the life cycle analysis of the process.
