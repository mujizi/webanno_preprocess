Various methods can be used to fill the light blocking recess 214 with light blocking material 252, but an ink jet method is preferable. Ink jet methods have been proven in ink jet printers, and enable the light blocking recess 214 to be filled quickly, economically, and without waste. The ink jet head 254 in this case is positioned and driven appropriately to evenly fill the light blocking recess 214 in the second light transmitting layer 210 with light blocking material 252.
Once the light blocking recess 214 is uniformly filled throughout with light blocking material 252, filling stops. If the light blocking material 252 contains solvent, the solvent is removed by heat treatment. Removing the solvent, however, causes the material to contract. It is therefore necessary to fill the recesses with enough material so that the thickness needed to assure the required opacity remains after solvent evaporation and material shrinkage.
An opaque layer 250 is thus formed on the second light transmitting layer 210 as shown in FIG. 10(B). The opaque layer 250 side of light transmitting layer 210 and a second reinforcing layer 270 are then bonded with a fourth light transmitting layer precursor 262 disposed therebetween. This process is the same as that used for bonding by way of intervening light transmitting layer precursor 32 in the first embodiment above, and light transmitting layer precursor 262 can also be selected from any of the materials usable for the light transmitting layer precursor 32 in the first embodiment.
An optical substrate 3 is achieved by thus spreading the fourth light transmitting layer precursor 262 and applying an appropriate setting process to form the fourth light transmitting layer 260 as shown in FIG. 10(C).
Optical substrate 3 comprises first to fourth light transmitting layers 30, 210, 230, and 260 disposed between first and second first reinforcing layers 240 and 270. In addition, a color pattern layer 220 is formed by filling pigment 62 to the plurality of color recesses 36 formed on one side of the first light transmitting layer 30. A plurality of lenses 34 is formed on the other side of the first light transmitting layer 30. The pixels of the color pattern layer 220 are furthermore each aligned with a corresponding lens 34.
