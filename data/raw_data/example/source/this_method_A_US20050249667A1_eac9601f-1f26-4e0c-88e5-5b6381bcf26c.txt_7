[1208] U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,526 (Ultrasound therapy apparatus delievering ultrasound waves having thermal and cavitation effects) teaches that "In order to obtain destruction of tissue exclusively by thermal effects, it is necessary for the acoustic field to be able to reach a threshold of destruction referred to as the "thermal dose". This threshold is a function of temperature reached and of the duration of application. It is thus possible to destroy tissue by application of a moderate temperature increase over a long duration of application or, on the contrary, through application of a significant temperature increase over a short period of application." The entire disclosure of said patent is incorporated by reference into this specification. U.S. Pat. No. 5,620,479 (Method and apparatus for thermal therapy of tumors) teaches that "Therapy can be effected using low temperature heat (e.g., <45.degree. C.), or high temperature (>45.degree. C.) heat can be used for thermal ablation or inducing coagulation necrosis." The entire disclosure of said patent is incorporated by reference into this specification.
[1209] The problem of "hyperthermia," while administering ultrasound and other energy therapies, that is, overheating and causing damage to normal healthy tissues during a therapeutic regimen, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,657,760 (Apparatus and method for noninvasive doppler ultrasound-guided real-time control of tissue damage in thermal therapy): "Hyperthermia is a popular thermal therapy for tumors and other tissue-related diseases. According to this method of treatment, a tumorous region inside a patient's body cavity is warmed to and kept at a temperature range of about 42.degree. to 50.degree. C. A number of methods of inducing hyperthermia have been tried, including electromagnetic wave (radiofrequency and microwave), whole body heating by external and extracorporeal means, and ultrasound. Hyperthermia has been applied both externally and by interstitial methods. However, with all these techniques, the problem exists of getting the energy to the target to cause the required cell death with predictability and precision, yet causing little or no damage to surrounding tissues. This problem is particularly pronounced with the heating of deep seated tumors, such as those in the liver." The entire disclosure of said U.S. Pat. No. 5,657,760 hereby incorporates by reference into this specification.
[1210] U.S. Pat. No. 5,657,760 (at column 8 and line 6 thereof) also describes a method to monitor the rise in temperature in an organism as a result of ultrasound therapy: "The method for ultrasonic Doppler detection of tissue response to thermal therapy according to the present invention broadly comprises providing an echo-Doppler transmitter/receiver coupled to a transducer, emitting ultrasonic waves from the transducer toward the region of a tissue receiving thermal therapy, receiving echoes from the thermally treated tissue, and converting the echoes to electrical echo signals, where the echo signals each contain a phase vector. The x and y components of the phase vector of each echo signal are derived as functions of range and time. The x and y components are sampled to produce multiple pairs of I and Q Doppler signals indicating motion and echogenicity of the tissue relative to the transducer at a plurality of tissue depths. The I and Q Doppler signals are then evaluated to determine the spatial profile of tissue temperature and the extent and geometry of tissue damage resulting from said thermal therapy. The evaluation results may be displayed for visual inspection and evaluation." This method uses a process described by the inventors in the following calculations: (commencing at column 4 line 47 thereof) "The technique is based on principles of both pulse-echo and pulsed Doppler ultrasound. By detecting and following the phase of the echoes returned from the transducer, the motion of the reflector with respect to the transducer can be quantified. The instantaneous phase of the returning echo is proportional to the distance of the reflector from the transducer. See Hartley et al. (1991) at p. 736. Using a tone burst mode of operation, the transmitted signal (St) has the following form: [Figure] where .omega. is the angular frequency of the transmitted wave, T is the pulse repetition period which must be an integer number of cycles of .omega., n is a positive integer, and tx is the duration of the transmitted burst. This tone burst is propagated from the transducer toward a target where part of it is reflected back toward the transducer which then acts as a receiver. The received echo signal (Sr) has the form [Figure] where a is the amplitude of the received echo signal and td is the time delay between the beginning of the transmitted burst and the beginning of the received echo signal. In turn, td=2d/c (3) where d is the distance from the transducer to the reflecting interface and c is the speed of sound in the target. Rearranging and substituting results in: [Figure] Since .omega.=2.pi.c/.lambda., eq. (4) can be put in the form [Figure] where lambda is the wavelength of the ultrasonic wave in the conducting medium (such as tissue), and where .phi.=4.pi.d/.lambda. (6) In eq. (6), .phi. represents the phase (in radians) of the echo signal with respect to the transmitter signal and is directly proportional to the distance d from the transducer to the reflecting target. A block diagram of a prior art ultrasonic displacement measuring instrument is shown in FIG. 1. In the instrument described in FIG. 1, phase is sensed by a quadrature-phase detector 32 consisting of two analog multipliers. The reference inputs to the multipliers are cos (.omega.t) [27] and sin (.omega.t) [29] and are derived from a master oscillator 26 which runs continuously at angular frequency .omega.. Multiplying each of these signals by the echo signal results in cos (.omega.t).times.a cos (.omega.t-.phi.)=a{cos (2.omega.-.phi.)+cos (.phi.)}/2 (7) and sin (.omega.t).times.a cos (.omega.t-.phi.=a{sin (2.omega.t-.phi.)+sin (.phi.)}/2 (8) for t as in eq. (2). If the above signals are low-pass filtered to remove the high frequency terms at 2.omega.t, are multiplied by 2 to eliminate the 1/2, and are sampled only during the received interval [i.e., t as in eq. (2)], the sampled, phase detected signals then become x=a cos .phi. (9) and y=a sin .phi., (10) where x and y can be considered as components of a polar coordinate phase vector of length a and angle .phi.. Components x and y are called "quadrature range-phase signals." In general, the target will be moving with respect to the transducer, which will generate a Doppler shift and cause a rotation of the phase vector. To see how the phase and Doppler shift frequency are related, consider a target moving at velocity v at an angle .theta. with respect to the sound beam axis. Its distance from the transducer d is given by d=.intg.ot v cos .theta.dt=vt cos .theta.+d0(11) where d0 is the initial position of the target. If eq. (11) is substituted into eq. (6), phase also becomes a function of time given by .phi.=(4.pi.vt/.lambda.) cos .theta.+constant. (12) Differentiating the phase yields an angular frequency (.omega.d): .omega.d=d.phi./dt=(4.pi.vt/.lambda.) cos .theta.. (13) Substituting .omega.d=2.pi.fd and .lambda.=c/f, eq. (13) becomes fd=(2fV/c) cos .theta., (14) which is the well-known Doppler equation with fd being the Doppler shift frequency, in Hz, of the reflected wave. The Doppler shift can thus be obtained from the phase by differentiation. For a moving target, the phase vector rotates with an angular frequency given by .omega.d in a direction corresponding to the direction of the target motion: clockwise for motion away from the transducer (receding phase) or counterclockwise for motion toward the transducer (advancing phase). Timing for the instrument shown in FIG. 1 (operated at 10 MHz) is controlled by 10 MHz crystal oscillator 26. The 10 MHz frequency is divided by 2560 by frequency divider 14 to produce a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 3.90625 kHz. A 0.4 .mu.s pulse from pulse generator 12 is used to gate 4 cycle bursts of the 10 MHz signal [see eq. (1)] to transmitter amplifier 28, which drives ultrasonic transducer 10. Transducer 10 converts the electrical signals to acoustic tone bursts, which are propagated into the tissue where they are reflected by structures along the sound beam. The echoes returning to transducer 10 are converted back into electrical signals [see eq. (2)], which are amplified by RF amplifier 30 to produce signal 31 (see eq. (4)) and compared by quadrature-phase detector 32 in phase to quadrature signals {cos (.omega.t) [27] and sin (.omega.t) [29]} from 10 MHz oscillator 26. The two phase detector outputs 33 and 35 (which are quadrature signals that correspond to eq. (7) and (8), respectively) are then sampled by dual sample and hold circuit 34 with a 0.2 .mu.s range-gate pulse 24 delayed by 2-50 .mu.s from the transmit pulse by variable delay circuit 18. The range of circuit 24 is selected by potentiometer 16. After sampling, the two signals are high-pass filtered at 1 Hz to remove the dc components from the stationary structures and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz by dual filters 36 to remove residual signals. Except for the lower bandwidth, the sampled, filtered signals 37 and 39 are the in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (O) Doppler signals (which correspond to eq. (9) and (10), respectively). Signals 37 and 39 resemble quadrature audio signals from a pulsed Doppler instrument for measuring blood flow, and may be received at output 52. The vector representation of the quadrature signals may be shown in X-Y display 54 shown in FIG. 1. The radius a represents the amplitude of the echo from the target, and the phase .phi. of the echo represents the position of the target. The change in position (or displacement) can be measured by noting the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) and counting the revolutions of the vector. Each revolution corresponds to reflector motion of 0.075 mm at 10 MHz. To improve the resolution of the instrument to 0.019 mm, revolutions are counted in 90.degree. increments corresponding to axis crossings in the X-Y display 54. Logic circuits in up-down counter controller 40 detect positive and negative zero crossings of each quadrature signal, assign a direction based on the polarity of the zero crossing and the polarity of the other signal at the time, and increment or decrement 8-bit up-down counter 40. Full-scale range for the 8-bit counter shown is about 4.8 mm. Digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 44 receives 8-bit output 42 from counter 40 and produces a voltage output 46 that represents the change in position of echoes within the sample volume with a calibration of 2 V/mm. Since no filter is used on displacement output 46, it is updated after each sample (approximately 4 kHz) whenever the reflector has moved 0.019 mm. Signals available from the instrument shown in FIG. 1 include: displacement 46 at 2 V/mm, analog range 20 at 0.1 V/cm, quadrature signals 52, and quadrature audio 52a from audio amplifier 50 and speaker 48. In addition, monitor outputs 21, 25, and 33 for oscilloscope 22 are provided from transmit pulse generator 12 (for triggering), range-gate pulse generator 24, and phase detector 32, respectively. Controls are a 2-40 mm range-gate potentiometer 16 and a 6, 7, or 8 bit limit switch 41 to up/down counter 40. Inputs are from a 10 MHz piezoelectric transducer 10 attached or planted within the tissue of interest, and a reset command 55 from a triggered event. No provision is made in the prior art circuit of FIG. 1, however, for real-time evaluation of the signals received by transducer 10 in relation to tissue thermal response, nor of controlling the extent or geometry of tissue thermal damage resulting from thermal treatment of a lesion in living tissue. Thus, a need exists for an apparatus and method for noninvasive, real-time monitoring and control of the extent and geometry of tissue damage in thermal therapies."
