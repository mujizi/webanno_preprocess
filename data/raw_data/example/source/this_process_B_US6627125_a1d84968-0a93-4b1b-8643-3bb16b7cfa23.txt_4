The color pattern layer 100 formed in the color recesses 112 of the first master 110 is bonded to one side of the first light transmitting layer 120. A plurality of lenses 124 transferred from the profile of the curved parts 22 is formed on the other side of the first light transmitting layer 120.
Next, as shown in FIG. 5(A), the second master 20 is separated from the light transmitting layer 120.
Then, as shown in FIG. 5(B), the surface of the first light transmitting layer 120 on which the lenses 124 are formed and a first reinforcing layer 140 are bonded with a second light transmitting layer precursor 132 disposed therebetween to form a second light transmitting layer 130 as shown in FIG. 5(C). This process can be the same as that used to spread and bond the first light transmitting layer precursor 32 in the first embodiment above. The light transmitting layer precursor 132 can also be selected from the above-noted materials available for use as light transmitting layer precursor 32.
Any of the materials usable for the reinforcing layer 50 in the first embodiment can also be used for this reinforcing layer 140. The light transmitting layer precursor 132 is also set using a process appropriate to its composition.
Referring next to FIG. 6(A), the first master 110 is removed from the first light transmitting layer 120 and color pattern layer 100. This leaves the color pattern layer 100 transferred from the profile of the color recesses 112 in the first master 110 molded integrally to.the first light transmitting layer 120.
