[0052] Next, the chilled condenser is shown in FIG. 1 that would replace the more complex chilled caustic scrubber used earlier in the pilot tests. In this embodiment the chiller condenser configuration was used extensively in the earlier testing, as well as during a nuclear generating station decommissioning project. The amount of acid gases from these wastes, from medical waste, and from MSW tested were small and nearly completely neutralized by the formation of ammonia during steam reforming, where this ammonia neutralized the last small amounts of acid gases. Thus, the need for high concentrations of caustic was not necessary to maintain a scrubber liquid pH of around 10. This function was replaced by a pH-controlled condensate tank just below the chiller operating at 4.degree. C. (40.degree. F.). The condensate water in this collection tank was used as the boiler water feed, since its quality was acceptable, even though it was monitored for added assurance. For radioactive wastes, it was obviously critical not to have a secondary radioactive waste stream from the process, such as condensate water, sent to drain. In this way, the water balance was fairly well maintained with little make-up or discharge.
[0053] The adsorption bed (i.e. granular activated carbon or equivalent) is the final trap for light hydrocarbons and the more volatile of the heavy metals and silanes. It operates best at room temperature or below being fed clean syngas, mostly free of entrained or formed fine particulate. The sorption beds would consist of multiple beds that would permit their stripping and reactivation as well as having the security of tandem beds to avoid the consequence of premature bed breakthrough in case of process upset. The stripped volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the sorption bed reactivation are fed back into the steam reformer for destruction.
[0054] Downstream of this adsorber bed is the syngas monitoring function: fuel cell test cell and gas sample. This process function is critically important in order to protect against damaging the fuel cell sensitive electrochemical catalysts, which can be poisoned with parts per million levels of sulfur- or chlorine-containing compounds, volatile heavy metals, as well as silanes. Not only must the on-line monitor be extremely sensitive to all potential and even unknown poisons at very low levels, but also it must be very fast in order to detect such poisons before they enter and poison the fuel cell. This can be accomplished by the novel concept of a sacrificial fuel cell test cell that contains a number of SOFC ceramic tubes operating under the equivalent conditions as those of the full-size commercial fuel cell producing the power, steam and heat in this energy-from-waste plant. The voltage and current output of these tubes are accurately and carefully monitored so that any statistically significant decline in performance can be detected, quickly.
[0055] If such poisoning effect is detected, the "#1 Divert to CEB" valve is actuated to send the syngas to the CEB vent system. At the same time the calorimeter controller adds natural gas to the fuel cell at the proper amount so as not to subject the cell to a large calorimetric change in heat content. In this way, the fuel cell continues in its operation without seeing the syngas contaminated with the poison. In addition, this fuel cell test cell is in duplicate with a hot standby test cell operating on natural gas, so that the poisoned test cell that just triggered the syngas diversion is switched out of service and the hot standby test cell is switched into service. With the poisoned test cell out of service and cool, its side is opened and the tubes removed and replaced with fresh tubes. These tubes are not expensive (i.e. cost around $5 each) and are a process consumable. These tubes can then be sent to an analytical laboratory where they are split in a clean room by diamond saw and analyzed by Auger ESCA (Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis), or electron micro-probe for surface contaminate deposit layer thickness and characterization. This analytical method will evaluate the seriousness of the poison incident and allow the process operators to see if any change in plant operation (or configuration) is needed. For example, there can always be poisons that have been previously unknown and not experienced before in the waste stream being processed. In this way, this concept of sacrificial SOFC test fuel cell tubes being used as a process monitor, on-line and real-time, is novel and very valuable in order to protect the large capital investment of a large fuel cell.
[0056] Also in this monitoring function is the gas sampling operation that allows for a gas sample to be removed at short notice. The gas is being fed continuously through a Summa canister (or equivalent) so that as long as the process is functioning well, the canister is continually being flushed with a fresh sample. But as soon as some test cell poisoning is detected, this canister is switched off-line, so that it can be removed and sent off to an analytical laboratory for detailed gas analysis to further support the electron-probe surface analysis of the sacrificial SOFC tubes.
