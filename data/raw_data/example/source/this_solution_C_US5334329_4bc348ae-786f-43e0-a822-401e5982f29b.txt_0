The following examples are illustrative of the process for preparing the nitrogen-containing and the nitrogen- and boron-containing compositions useful as ashless dispersants (B) in this invention:
EXAMPLE B-1
A polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride is prepared by the reaction of a chlorinated polyisobutylene with maleic anhydride at 200.degree. C. The polyisobutenyl group has a number average molecular weight of about 850 and the resulting alkenyl succinic anhydride is found to have an acid number of 113 (corresponding to an equivalent weight of 500). To a mixture of 500 grams (1 equivalent) of this polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride and 160 grams of toluene there is added at room temperature 35 grams (1 equivalent) of diethylene triamine. The addition is made portionwise throughout a period of 15 minutes, and an initial exothermic reaction caused the temperature to rise to 50.degree. C. The mixture then is heated and a water-toluene azeotrope distilled from the mixture. When no more water distilis, the mixture is heated to 150.degree. C. at reduced pressure to remove the toluene. The residue is diluted with 350 grams of mineral oil and this solution is found to have a nitrogen content of 1.6%.
EXAMPLE B-2
The procedure of Example B-1 is repeated using 31 grams (1 equivalent) of ethylene diamine as the amine reactant. The nitrogen content of the resulting product is 1.4%.
