[0026] Laminated bus bar cost is generally a function of the amount of material required to construct the bus, the number of laminate layers required to support a configuration and the overall complexity of the required laminate member where minimal material, minimal layers and minimal contours (i.e., bends in the laminates) are all advantageous. Unfortunately, providing a configuration that uses minimal laminate material, requires minimal layering and restricts the laminate to a single plane is extremely difficult given the sink member configurations required to minimize overall configuration size and provide essentially uniform heat dissipating capacity to all switching devices mounted to the sink. For example, where devices are arranged in rows and columns to provide similar distances between channel inlets and devices down stream therefrom, typically a large number of laminate layers and a correspondingly complex labyrinth of vias are required to link components together. As another instance, where switching device lengths are aligned with similarly dimensioned capacitor lengths the lamination bus typically requires one or, more often, several bends to accommodate connection terminals that reside in disparate planes. In either of these two cases (i.e., many layers or several laminate bends) the amount of material required to configure a laminated bus bar can be excessive and hence unsuitable for certain applications.
[0027] Yet one other cost consideration related to converter assemblies has to do with component versatility or the ability to use converter components in more than one conversion assembly. Component versatility is particularly important with respect to the more expensive component types such as, for example, the heat sink assembly, the laminated bus bar, etc. In this regard, overall system costs can be reduced by designing sinks and laminated bus bars that can be used with various device and capacitor types. For instance, assume that a first converter assembly includes a first type of switching device, a first type of capacitor, a first type of sink member and a first type of laminate bar. Also assume that the sink, devices and a capacitors are dimensioned such that when the capacitors and devices are mounted to the sink, the capacitors connection terminals are on the same plane as the device connection terminals. Here, the first laminate bus bar type can be planar and hence relatively inexpensive.
[0028] Next assume that a designer wants to swap out a second capacitor type for the first type in the assembly where the second capacitor type has a thickness between its dissipating surface and its connection terminals that is different than a similarly measures thickness of the first capacitor type. In this case, when the capacitors are swapped, the capacitor and device terminals will no longer reside within the same plane and a different, perhaps custom designed, laminate will be required to accommodate the change. In the alternative, the sink design may be altered to accommodate the change in device and capacitor terminal planes although this solution would be relatively expensive. Similar problems occur when different switching devices are swapped into assemblies.
[0029] On a higher level, instead of relying on component versatility to reduce costs, if demand for a converter assembly having certain operating characteristics is high enough, a complete modular converter assembly can be efficiently (e.g., cost effectively) designed and manufactured. While high volume exists for certain small conversion assemblies, unfortunately, larger and more complex assemblies typically are not sold in volumes that justify modular, pre-manufactured, designs--there just is not enough demand for complex larger configurations.
[0030] Even where large scale conversion assemblies having similar operating capabilities are in relatively high demand, often these large scale assemblies require a relatively large space within an application. In many applications, while space allotted for converter components may be sufficient, the allotted space may require a specially designed assembly. In other words, the space layout for a converter assembly in a first application may be different than the space layout for a converter assembly in a second application despite similar conversion requirements (e.g., power, ripple limitations, etc.). This spatial limitation on converter assembly versatility further limits volume requirements for large scale complex converter assemblies. Thus, at the high end, converter assemblies are often custom designed to meet operating and spatial layout requirements of specific applications and hence are expensive.
