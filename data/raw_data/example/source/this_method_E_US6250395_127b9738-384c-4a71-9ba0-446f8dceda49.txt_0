In another embodiment of the invention, controlled buoyancy devices are attached to the laterally extending strings (or sleeves) to regulate the depth of the string in the water or, to float the string on the water surface.
An important feature of the present invention is that it permits the pipe used in the construction of a well to be run into and removed from the well quickly and with a minimum number of connection make-ups and breakouts. A related benefit of the method of the present invention is that pipe strings may be assembled and tested while the drilling rig is performing drilling operations. The pre-assembled and tested string may be quickly inserted into the well once the drill pipe is removed. The method eliminates the time normally expended in assembling and testing the pipe string as it is being lowered into the well.
Another method of the present invention comprises the steps of assembling and testing a well string at a remote location, towing the well string to a deep water location, and running the well string into the well at the remote location as a continuous string. In this method, the well string is fed from the water storage location through the curving guide to the drilling floor. The method permits the string to be assembled and tested at a specially designed remote facility at a cost substantially less than that required for assembling and testing the string at the deep-water location.
A feature of the second basic embodiment of the invention in which the stands are stored vertically in the space between the drilling rig and the water bottom may be used without raising the drill string above the drilling rig floor. The system finds its primary application in wells that are drilled without the use of a riser string. In such applications, an underwater makeup and breakout system disconnects the drill string at the underwater wellhead to free a stand of pipe. The stand is moved laterally away from the well and stored in the water area between the drilling rig and the water bottom. The stand may be supported from the drilling rig or may be supported by a separate, buoyant racking structure or may be supported within the riser pipe.
The system may include a continuous cable pulling/running system that engages the drill string at the underwater wellhead and extracts a length of the string from the well. The underwater system disconnects the extracted portion of the string to form a stand. The stand is then moved laterally and racked with previously removed stands of drill pipe. The underwater makeup system is used to reconnect the stands at the wellhead and the continuous running system is employed to reinsert the string in the well. In deep water applications where water depths may exceed 3,000 ft., only ten stands of pipe are required to store a 30,000 ft. string.
