4-acetyl-3-benzyloxycarbonyl-2-cyclopropyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0240]The compound of Example 21 (7.60 g) was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL). To this solution, activated manganese dioxide (59.0 g) was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 hours at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixture was filtered through Celite and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=8:1 and then 1:1) to give a yellow solid. The obtained solid was dissolved in dichloromethane (90 mL) and activated manganese dioxide (32.0 g) was again added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixture was filtered through Celite and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the title compound (5.57 g) as a yellow solid.
