[0008] However, a conventional unidirectional solidification method still had many problems in terms of characteristics and production cost of finished polycrystalline silicon. For example, the method shown in FIG. 3 basically employs a batch process, and thus melting of charged raw material silicon or cooling of solidified polycrystalline silicon to room temperature require longer time than time required for crystal growth itself. Production of large-scale polycrystalline silicon for improved productivity particularly results in longer time required for melting or solidification, and an initial purpose is hardly achieved. A release agent such as expensive silicon nitride powder must be applied to an inner surface of the crucible 300 in advance to prevent clinging of the finished polycrystalline silicon while being taken out of the crucible. Even so, an expensive quartz glass crucible often broke due to thermal stress in cooling of the polycrystalline silicon after solidification.
[0009] Crystal uniformity is another problem. That is, in unidirectional solidification, crystal grains are small in a portion close to a crucible base during initial growth and reach a certain size through coalescence of the crystal grains with progress in solidification. Thus, the crystal grains are small in the vicinity of the crucible base. Further, impurities from the crucible may be diffused into the vicinity of the crucible base. When raw material silicon contains metal impurities, the impurities remain in the melted silicon 305 due to a segregation effect with progress in growth. A concentration of the impurities gradually increases, and thus, a concentration of impurities in polycrystalline silicon tends to increase as approaching to the surface. Impurities from an inner wall of the crucible may also diffuse into the crystals. Thus, only a central portion of an ingot may have high quality in the grown polycrystalline silicon. Countermeasures for such problems include: placing a seed crystal plate 307 on a base of the crucible 300 to improve crystallinity in the vicinity of the base and to prevent contamination from the base; and using a high purity product for a release agent applied to the crucible 300 or to an inner wall of the crucible. However, both countermeasures include factors for cost increase.
[0010] An electromagnetic casting method is a known production method for polycrystalline silicon with a longer growth time per batch capable of preventing clinging of the polycrystalline silicon and an inner wall of the crucible or of preventing contamination from the inner wall of the crucible. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H04-342496 illustrates an example of the electromagnetic casting method (FIG. 5). According to the method, melted silicon is held by a magnetic field even without the crucible, and thus, no impurities diffuse from an environment. Further, raw material silicon can be continuously supplied, and thus, growth per batch may be continued for a long time. However, use of low purity raw material silicon in the method gradually increases a concentration of impurities in the melted silicon and further increases a concentration of impurities in a polycrystalline silicon ingot, hindering unlimitedly continuous growth. In this method, high temperature silicon may scatter at once if a magnetic field holding the melted silicon should break due to power failure or the like.
[0011] Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H06-345584 describes: supply of a semiconductor material during crystal growth; and provision of an induction coil in a pulling portion. However, the induction coil described herein has a function of melting a semiconductor but is not in contact with an ingot, and thus cannot directly shape a cross section of the ingot.
[0012] Further, Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. H02-036560 describes flow of a melt as a countermeasure for concentrating of impurities.
