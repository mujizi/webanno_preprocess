The anchorage to plinth 400 provides a soft connection of the membrane between the dam body and the base plinth, as illustrated in FIG. 21.
For this purpose, the lower edge of membrane 213 is folded to create a bend 220 along a trench 221 executed between the inside edge of plinth 400 and the transition zone 217.
The advantage of this solution is that in case settlements occur in the dam body, bend 220 allows the membrane 213 to deform following the movements of the dam body, creating an elongation compatible with the mechanical resistance of the membrane itself. If so required, it is also possible to create a layer of anti-grip material and provide a layer of protective geotextile along the trench for creation of the bend, between membrane 213 and zone 217.
Should the waterproofing membrane be ballasted with a covering element 222, as schematically shown in FIG. 21, trench 221 can be filled with a layer of loose material with a very fine grading, for example sand, which does not oppose a substantial resistance to the movement of membrane 213 in case it is subjected to tensile stress due to movement and/or settlements of the dam body. The filling layer will be a protection for membrane 213 from any mechanical action by ballast 222. If needed, it is also possible to create a layer of anti-grip material and provide a layer of protection geotextile, along the trench for creation of the bend, between membrane 213 and area 221.
The advantage of using a geocomposite consists in the fact that the geotextile substrate, if coupled adherent to the PVC waterproofing layer or other proper elastically deformable synthetic material, supplies an increase in the mechanical resistance of the geocomposite itself. Therefore, in the event that significant deformations are caused in the geocomposite, normally in the range of 10-20%, the geotextile substrate which is heat-welded to the PVC layer or similar layer, is detached from it, allowing the two layers to become independent. Therefore, due to the strong friction, the geotextile will remain adherent to the diaphragm consisting of the layer of transition material in the dam body, while the elastic PVC geomembrane or similar, having an elongation coefficient which is significantly higher and which can reach values as high as 300%, will be able to move freely on the underlying geotextile and to therefore contribute with a larger surface to the distribution of the stresses.
