Glycerin, 50 grams, was added to deionized water, 935 grams, and heated to 45-50.degree. C., while stirring. Stablese 06, 10 grams, was added to this vigorously stirred solution until complete dissolution was achieved. Gantrez S-95, 5 grams, was added to this solution. The pH was adjusted to 3.8 by adding 30% sodium hydroxide.
Example 21
The following formulation for ophthalmic use, to provide moisture to dry eyes, was made as follows: Deionized water, 490 grams, was added to glycerin, 6.25 grams, and heated to 50-55.degree. C while stirring. Stablese 06, 2.5 grams, was added to this solution, followed by the addition of Gantrez 955, 1.25 grams. After complete dissolution of the polymers, the pH was adjusted to 7.3-7.5 by adding 30% sodium hydroxide.
