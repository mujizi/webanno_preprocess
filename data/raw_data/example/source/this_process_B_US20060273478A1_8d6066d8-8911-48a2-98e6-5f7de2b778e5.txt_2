[0053] In this step, as explained with reference to FIGS. 5a to 5c, the mold 110 is machined by a DTM, which allows easy manufacture of an aspheric lens, and enables formation of a greater depth of sag and thus manufacture of a high sag lens.
[0054] Then, polymer 115 is injected into the grooves 110a of the mold 110 and cured by ultraviolet ray with its surface exposed to air. In this process, polymer inside the grooves 110a of the mold 110 is most slowly cured at the interface with air due to restrained radical reaction with oxygen.
[0055] Therefore, shrinkage caused during curing of polymer 115 is transferred toward an exposed surface P' which is not yet cured. The lens section 120 is finally cured with its exposed surface P' suffering from shrinkage. Consequently, such exposed surface P' is deformed. Moreover, bubbles which may build up inside the lens section 120 in this process freely exit to the air through the exposed surface P' without remaining inside
[0056] According to the invention, as explained above, the lens section 120 is formed in the grooves 110a of the mold through just one molding process. But the invention is not limited thereto. In case of a much higher sag, polymer may be split-injected into the grooves 110 of the mold and cured repeatedly by ultraviolet ray to form the lens section 120.
[0057] Thereafter, a substrate is adhered integrally to a back side of the lens section 120 (see FIG. 7b). In this step, as described regarding FIGS. 5a to 5c, the lens section 120 of the mold 110 is coated with an adhesive polymer 130 having a composition identical to polymer 115 of the lens section 120. The adhesive polymer 130 is adhered to a predetermined position of the substrate 125. In this process, the adhesive polymer 130 is coated in a liquid state, thereby correcting unevenness of the exposed surface P'.
