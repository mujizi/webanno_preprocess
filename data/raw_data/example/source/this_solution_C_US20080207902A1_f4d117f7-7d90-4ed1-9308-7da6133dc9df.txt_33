Example 145
3-chloro-2-ethyl-7-methoxy-4-propionyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0487]The compound of Example 116 (1.96 g) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (80 mL). While this solution was kept at -78.degree. C., 1 mol/L lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide/tetrahydrofuran solution (9.11 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at -78.degree. C. to room temperature for 30 min. Iodomethane (567 .mu.L) was added at -78.degree. C. and the mixture was stirred at -78.degree. C. to room temperature for 5 hours. Subsequently, the reaction was terminated by adding a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and the mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure and purification by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=1:4) afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (495.6 mg).
