An example of a use for a material produced according to the invention is in an intraocular lens, such as, e.g., an intraocular lens comprising a siloxane-urea segmented copolymer, having a modulus in a range of about 1.0 to 120 MPa, an ultimate tensile strength in a range of about 1.5 to <22 MPa, a level of equilibrium water absorption in a range of about .about.0 to 100% by weight and a refractive index in a range of about 1.43 to 1.46.
PDMS containing silicone-urea copolymers display a combination of very interesting properties. These include very low glass transition temperatures (-123.degree. C.), high thermal, UV and oxidative stability, low surface energy, hydrophobicity, high gas permeability, good electrical properties and biocompatibility. In spite of these attractive properties, silicone containing thermoplastic elastomers usually display low tensile strengths when compared with conventional elastomeric systems. This might not seem to be very surprising because, even highly filled and crosslinked PDMS elastomers display ultimate tensile strengths of about 10-12 MPa.
Mechanical properties and ultimate strength of multiphase copolymers are closely related to their complex, heterogeneous supramolecular structure. Large number parameters including chemical (bond strength) and structural factors (crystallinity, hydrogen bonding, defects), processing conditions and thermal history play major roles in determining the microphase morphology of copolymers. For block or segmented copolymers, an especially important parameter which the present inventors have recognized but otherwise may not be apparent, is the nature and properties of the interface between two phases. Sharpness between two phases with dissimilar properties could create a weak point in a block copolymer. For example, in biological systems (e.g. proteins) this problem is solved by creating a gradient rather than a sharp transition between phases.
When compared with their polyether-based homologs, silicone-urea copolymers display much lower ultimate tensile strength and fairly low elongation at break values as shown in Table 1. This may be due to (i) the lack of stress-induced crystallization in PDMS at room temperature, (ii) the inherent mechanical weakness of the PDMS chains, since at room temperature they are about 150.degree. C. above their Tg values, or (iii) the presence of a very sharp transition between continuous PDMS matrix and urea domains, leading to a poor energy transfer mechanism between the PDMS and urea phases and thus poor tensile properties. It is not possible to have any control on the phenomena described in (i) and (ii), however, it is possible to controllably modify the structure and nature of the interface between PDMS and urea segments by using reactive polyether oligomers, such as .alpha.,.omega.-functionally terminated (e.g. amine or hydroxyl) reactive poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(propylene oxide) (PPO), poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO) oligomers or .alpha.,.omega.-hydroxy terminated aliphatic polyesters.
With inventive design and incorporation of polyether segments into polydimethylsiloxane-urea copolymers, the ultimate tensile strengths of these materials may be dramatically improved. In addition to the tensile strengths, other properties that can be controllably modified or improved, include; solubility of the polymer, Young's modulus, tear strength, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, water uptake, refractive index and biocompatibility. The ability that the present invention provides to manipulate such properties makes the copolymers of the present invention useable in a variety of important end use applications.
