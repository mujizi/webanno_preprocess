[0065] The cooling fluid (CL), which has been evaporatively cooled by the above process, is gathered in the collection sump 18 and divided into a first cooling fluid (CL1) and a second cooling fluid (CL2). The first cooling fluid (CL1) is supplied to the heat exchange apparatus to be cooled. (=Step a)
[0066] Meanwhile, the second cooling fluid (CL2) occupying 20%.about.30% of the entire cooling fluid (CL) is supplied to and flows in the circulating member 50 by means of the circulating pump 52 installed in the collection sump 18. In other words, it flows separately from the first cooling fluid (CL1). The second cooling fluid (CL2) passing through the circulating member 50 by means of the circulating pump 52 as the above is forcibly supplied to the sensible air-cooling sections 40 placed at the air inlets 16. (=Step b)
[0067] The second cooling fluid (CL2) supplied to the sensible air-cooling section 40 passes through a plurality of heat exchange members 42 in a multiplepass form, as shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B. During this process, the outside air inflow (OA), which is introduced into the cooling tower 10 (=the evaporative cooler) by means of the ventilating fan 12, contacts the cooling fins 44 and the heat exchange members 42, to thereby cause a heat exchange. (Step b-1)
[0068] Namely, the second cooling fluid (CL2), which has been evaporatively cooled to a lower temperature than the outside air (OA), passes through each heat exchange member 42 of the sensible air-cooling section 40, and the cooling fins 44 attached to each heat exchange member 42 contact with the outside air inflow (OA). Thereby, the outside air inflow (OA), which is introduced into the cooling tower 10, is cooled at the sensible air-cooling section 40 by releasing heat to the second cooling fluid (CL2) with a relatively low temperature via the cooling fins 44.
[0069] At this time, the overall moving direction of the second cooling fluid (CL2) in the sensible air-cooling section 40 is substantially opposite to the introducing moving direction of the outside air inflow (OA), so a counter flow arrangement is created between the second cooling fluid (CL2) and the outside air inflow (OA) for the improved cooling efficiency.
