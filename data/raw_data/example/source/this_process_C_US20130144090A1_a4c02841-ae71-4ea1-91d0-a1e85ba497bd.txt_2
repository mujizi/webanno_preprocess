[0091] As a comparison of hydrocondensation with efforts to simply remove oxygen from oxygenates derived from biomass and does not attempt to create carbon-carbon bonds to create longer chain hydrocarbons Table XV shows the overall product yields from a hydrodeoxygenation alone process and hydrocondensation alone process. For the hydrocondensation process, on a carbon basis, 6% of inlet carbon was converted to light gases, 46% to light naphtha, 21% to heavy naphtha, and 10% to distillates. In comparison, the hydrodeoxygenation alone process made more light gases and did not make heavy naphtha and distillates.

[0092] These results indicate that the hydrocondensation using Pt/Pd or conventional hydrodeoxygenation catalyst increases product value over a hexane-pentane product mixture obtained using hydrodeoxygenation alone in the presence of diesel. The process does not require diesel co-feed, which may reduce operating cost. Furthermore, sulfur is completely eliminated from this process. This enables recycling of hydrogen with little purification. All these benefits indicate the increased value of this process.
