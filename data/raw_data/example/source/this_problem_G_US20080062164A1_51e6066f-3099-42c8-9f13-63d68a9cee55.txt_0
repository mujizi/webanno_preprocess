[0168] In another exemplary embodiment, partially shown in FIGS. 17 and 18, the calibration system is used in a display device with a curved screen 171 and 181 respectively and multiple projectors 1 to 3. The projectors span the entire area of the curved screens 171 and 181 and they are controlled by the same electronic unit. The geometric calibration is done for each projector 1 to 3, mapping onto the respective area of the screens 171 and 181. The geometry calibration, in addition, rotates and translates each projector image to stitch it to an adjacent projector image. In particular, in the overlapping areas, the corresponding pixels are overlaid on top of each other. It should be noted that the mappings on the screens 171 and 181 from the different projectors 1 to 3 have different incident angles and varies as the screens 171 and 181 curve. The electronic unit, having or obtaining a map of the curved screens 171 and 181, as represented by the warp data, corrects for the angular variations across the screens 171 and 181.
[0169] In addition to geometry calibration, color calibration of each projector 1 to 3 is done to ensure color characteristics are visually the same in all projector areas. The electronic unit is also adapted to divide the pixel color and brightness between or amongst the projectors 1 to 3 such that a uniform brightness and color mapping is achieved across the curved screens 171 and 181. It should be noted that any number of individual projectors can be used and the overlapping areas can be shared amongst many projectors while applying the same calibration techniques.
[0170] For projection onto a curved screen, the focus problem is always paramount. This stems from the fact that a projector has a flat focal plane whereas the screen is curved, and as such, different portions of the screen have different distances from any focal plane. Looking at a portion of the screen, the image may look more in focus than another portion of the screen. To overcome this problem while projecting with a single projector, a technique can be used to minimize defocusing, an exemplary embodiment of which is shown in FIG. 19. In this case, the calibration system places the projection focal plain in such a way that the sum of the squared distances of a series of normal lines from curved screen 191 onto focal plane 193 is minimal. If one wishes to get the center of the screen more focused than the sides, one could give more weight to the segments connecting the center portion of the screen to the focal plane.
[0171] In this case, the optimal focal plane can be pre-computed based on the known shape of the screen. The intersection of the optimal focal plane with the screen gives the points on the screen where the image is best focused, and in turn, a maximal contrast is obtained. With the optimal plane and maximal contrast points computed and known, an image test pattern, similar to that used in FIG. 16, is projected onto the screen, and the image is then captured and analyzed for contrast. If the maximum contrast positions in the captured image coincide with the previously determined maximal contrast points, within some tolerance, then the projected image lies on the optimal focal plane. If the maximum contrast points do not coincide with the previously determined maximal contrast points, then the projector focus is adjusted and the process repeated until a match is obtained. It should be noted that this technique is applicable to screens which are curved in one dimension (e.g. cylindrical, zero spatial curvature, etc.) or in two dimensions (e.g. spherical, non-zero spatial curvature, etc.).
[0172] In another exemplary embodiment partially shown in FIG. 20, in addition to the calibration already explained, the focus problem is addressed by projecting images from multiple projectors at different angles. As shown in this figure, by shining the projectors at these specific angles on specific areas of curved screen 201, one could substantially eliminate the defocusing problem. The angles are such that each projection axis is substantially normal to the corresponding screen portion on which it projects and each focal plane is almost tangential at its center to the covered portion of curved screen 201. To optimize each segment's focus, a technique identical to the one shown in FIG. 19 could be used. Alternatively, the center of each focal segment could be kept tangent to the screen. In this exemplary embodiment, the calibration system matches the focus of the multiple projector overlapped area as well as the pixel geometry, brightness, and color to produce a smooth and seamless and in-focus image on the screen 201. As a result of this technique, the warping becomes much less severe as the angle between the focal planes and the screen tangents decreases.
