[0144] Accordingly, it was confirmed that when, as a film-formation condition, no external magnetic field was applied, the squareness ratio M.sub.r/M.sub.s became equal to or smaller than 0.65, and the residual magnetization was insufficient. Hence, it became clear that an application of an external magnetic field is a requisite film-formation condition.
(3-4-6) Third Comparative Example
[0145] Next, the E-Al.sub.0.5Fe.sub.1.5O.sub.3 water slurry of 10 wt % and a PEG 500000 aqueous solution of 10 wt % were mixed together at a ratio by weight of 1:1. Water was added in this solution, and the addition of water was terminated when the solution viscosity became 56 cP, and the solution was taken as a coating liquid. A PET film was subjected to a so-called bar-coating by this coating liquid, and immediately dried for substantially 30 minutes at a room temperature in a superconducting magnet with an external magnetic field of 1 T, thereby producing a magnetic thin film.
[0146] Thereafter, the magnetization of a magnetic material of the third comparative example having the magnetic thin film formed in this manner was measured by an SQUID. As a result, according to the third comparative example, as shown in the table 1, the squareness ratio M.sub.r/M.sub.s was 0.63.
[0147] Accordingly, it was confirmed that when, as a film-formation condition, the external magnetic field was 1 T smaller than those of the first and second examples, the squareness ratio M.sub.r/M.sub.s became equal to or smaller than 0.65, and the residual magnetization was insufficient to orient the magnetic particles in the magnetization direction. Hence, it became clear that an application of the external magnetic field of equal to or greater than 2 T to this coating liquid is a requisite film-formation condition.
