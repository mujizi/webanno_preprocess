[0003] One downside to current insulated containers is the limited length of time that an insulated container can keep something cold. For example, if ice is used in an insulated container, the ice will often melt after a relatively short period of time, because an insulated container typically cannot maintain the colder interior temperatures needed to prevent melting of the ice. Frozen ice packs do not last much longer.
[0004] Another downside to most contemporary insulated containers is that the inside cannot be maintained at freezing temperatures for very long. To solve this problem, many companies often use dry ice to keep the contents of an insulated container below freezing (i.e., 32 degrees Fahrenheit). However, even dry ice has time limitations, and use and handling of dry ice can be difficult.
[0005] One solution that has recently been used for providing insulated containers that can maintain cold temperatures for long periods of time is to provide refrigeration units in the insulated containers. However, this solution has not always been convenient. For example, traditional vapor cycle systems, while efficient, are quite large and heavy. In addition, such refrigeration units typically must be plugged into an AC outlet or a car cigarette lighter to provide cooling. While such a cooling unit works well for cooling items in the insulated container, an AC outlet or similar power supply is not always readily available. A few 12 volt or 24 volt systems are available today; however, these systems are also large and heavy. The vapor cycle 12 and 24-volt systems also may have problems with vibrations during transportation.
[0006] In addition, there exists absorption and adsorption refrigerators, but these fail if enough vibrations exist and improper orientation may also cause the units to fail. Like the vapor cycle refrigerators, these cooler systems are heavy and hard to handle.
[0007] The following presents a simplified summary of some embodiments of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some embodiments of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
