[0055] An advantage of using direct sequencing to measure aneuploidy non-invasively is that it is able to make full use of the sample, while PCR based methods analyze only a few targeted sequences. In this study, we obtained on average 5 million reads per sample in a single run, of which .about.66,000 mapped to chromosome 21. Since those 5 million reads represent only a portion of one human genome, in principle less than one genomic equivalent of DNA is sufficient for the detection of aneuploidy using direct sequencing. In practice, a larger amount of DNA was used since there is sample loss during sequencing library preparation, but it may be possible to further reduce the amount of blood required for analysis.
[0056] Mapping shotgun sequence information (i.e., sequence information from a fragment whose physical genomic position is unknown) can be done in a number of ways, which involve alignment of the obtained sequence with a matching sequence in a reference genome. See, Li et al., "Mapping short DNA sequencing reads and calling variants using mapping quality score," Genome Res., 2008 Aug. 19. [Epub ahead of print].
[0057] We observed that certain chromosomes have large variations in the counts of sequenced fragments (from sample to sample, and that this depends strongly on the G/C content (FIG. 1A) It is unclear at this point whether this stems from PCR artifacts during sequencing library preparation or cluster generation, the sequencing process itself, or whether it is a true biological effect relating to chromatin structure. We strongly suspect that it is an artifact since we also observe G/C bias on genomic DNA control, and such bias on the Solexa sequencing platform has recently been reported (38, 39). It has a practical consequence since the sensitivity to aneuploidy detection will vary from chromosome to chromosome; fortunately the most common human aneuploidies (such as 13, 18, and 21) have low variation and therefore high detection sensitivity. Both this problem and the sample volume limitations may possibly be resolved by the use of single molecule sequencing technologies, which do not require the use of PCR for library preparation (40).
[0058] Plasma DNA samples used in this study were obtained about 15 to 30 minutes after amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Since these invasive procedures disrupt the interface between the placenta and maternal circulation, there have been discussions whether the amount of fetal DNA in maternal blood might increase following invasive procedures. Neither of the studies to date have observed a significant effect (41, 42).
[0059] Our results support this conclusion, since using the digital PCR assay we estimated that fetal DNA constituted less than or equal to 10% of total cell-free DNA in the majority of our maternal plasma samples. This is within the range of previously reported values in maternal plasma samples obtained prior to invasive procedures (13). It would be valuable to have a direct measurement addressing this point in a future study.
