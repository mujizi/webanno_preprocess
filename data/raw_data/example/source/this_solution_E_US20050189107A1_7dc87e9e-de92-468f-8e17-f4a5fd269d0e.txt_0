[0006] Finally, sustained casing pressure can be created by leakage from formations above the top of cement. During the cementing process lost circulation can occur and cause the top of cement to be lower than the position desired. As a result, some productive formations may not be covered by the cement. Furthermore, formations such as fractured shale, although thought to be non-productive, may be capable of producing sustained, minor amounts of hydrocarbons. The leakage through the wellbore mud from either source can result in sustained casing pressure.
[0007] While conventional wellheads typically provide a pressure relief line, which relieves the excess pressure from the "A" annulus (the innermost annuli), they provide no means for relieving the excess pressure from the other annuli, which can be numerous. Indeed, in a typical deepwater well, it is not uncommon to have a conductor casing, a surface casing, and multiple nested other casing strings, e.g., three or more, as well as the production casing, all of which have annuli formed there between, which are subject to the increases in fluid pressure identified above. One possible solution to this problem suggested by MMS is to modify existing wellheads, e.g., by providing one or more pressure relief lines that connect to, and bleed pressure from, each of the remaining annuli. A drawback of such a solution, however, is that it would be very expensive to implement, as wellhead design is quite complex and expensive.
[0008] Another solution is to employ expensive high-grade (i.e., high strength) casing for each layer of the casing and production tubing. A drawback to this solution, however, is that it also considerably increases the cost of completing the well given that often times thousands of feet of piping are employed in each deep well. Yet another but similar solution is to employ heavier casing (i.e., thicker) with a reduced internal diameter. A drawback of this solution is that the production flowpath is smaller than it could otherwise be, which in turn results in a less efficient production flow. If a certain production flowpath cross-sectional area is required, a larger bore would have to be drilled, which lengthens the required drill time at considerable extra cost. If a certain production flowpath cross-sectional area is not required, the reduced casing internal diameters would require smaller tools to be used to drill and complete lower sections of the well. Procurement of these smaller tools and the limited amount of force that can be applied to them while drilling slows the drilling process and adds further to costs.
[0009] The present invention is an annular pressure relief collar that eliminates or at least minimizes the increased fluid pressures formed in the annuli between concentric well casings. The present invention provides considerable advantages over other solutions to the pressure problem.
[0010] In one embodiment, the present invention is an apparatus for relieving trapped annular fluid pressure between concentric casing strings. The apparatus includes a housing having an outer surface and a hollow inner cavity and a set of end connections disposed on opposite ends of the cylindrical housing, which are adapted to join adjacent sections of a casing string. Multiple blades are located on the external surface of the housing, which in one embodiment is cylindrical. The apparatus is adapted for installation between adjacent concentric casing strings. It also includes a pressure relief mechanism, which opens the passage of fluid from an annulus between adjacent concentric casing strings disposed outside of the housing to an annulus between different adjacent concentric casing strings disposed inside the hollow inner cavity when the annular fluid pressure reaches a predetermined value. A pressure relief mechanism is placed into each of the blades.
