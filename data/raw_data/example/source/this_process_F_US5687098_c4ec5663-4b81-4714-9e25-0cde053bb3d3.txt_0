FIGS. 6A and 6B show a farther flow chart used in connection with the system of FIG. 1.
Turning to the block diagram of FIG. 1, a valve, 10, has a moveable element therein located adjacent the alterable extent flow opening it controls (valve element 10 herein) which is selectively positioned by a valve actuator, 11, and an indication of the position achieved by that valve element is provided through a position sensor, 12. Valve element 10 is used to control passages of materials in a material process, 13, of an arbitrary nature. Some variable characterizing this process is sensed in a process variable transmitter, 14, and its value is transmitted back to a process controller, 15, directing operation of the process plant to control the process.
The output of position sensor 12 is supplied to the valve positioner formed by a valve position controller, 16, operated under the direction of a microcomputer provided therein, and an actuator control signal generator, 17, which receives an output signal from controller 16 as its input. Actuator control signal generator 17 converts the output signal from valve position controller 16 to the corresponding pressure value to be established in the pressure chamber of valve actuator 11 as an input to that actuator, this pressure chamber being formed in part by a diaphragm used to operate the actuator valve stem of valve actuator 11. Note that position sensor 12 has a solid line input in FIG. 1 from valve actuator 11 indicating that the position input information is taken from the position of the valve actuator stem. Alternatively, there is shown in a part dashed line and part solid line input to position sensor 12 from valve 10 indicating that the position of valve element 10, as detected from the position of the valve stem, can alternatively serve as the measured output variable.
In operation, a user interacts with the control valve and process 13 at a user process control interface, 18, which is employed by the user to provide commands to process controller 15 responsible for the control of the entire process 13 in support of which process controller 15 is in communication with other control devices used in the plant for process 13 but not shown in FIG. 1. Process controller 15 translates the input commands supplied by the user at interface 18 and sends them along, typically over a 4 to 20 ma current loop, as "setpoint" signal commands to valve position controller 16. Valve position controller 16 has therein the microcomputer described above which is programmed to follow an algorithm for controlling valve actuator 11 in response to setpoint signal commands through properly generating a signal for this purpose for provision to actuator control signal generator 17 to generate a corresponding pneumatic pressure in the actuator pressure chamber for positioning the valve stem.
