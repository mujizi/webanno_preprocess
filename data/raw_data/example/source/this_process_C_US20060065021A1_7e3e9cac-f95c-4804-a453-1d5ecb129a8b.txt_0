[0021] Exemplary patents that disclose NGJ methods include U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,695,992; 6,520,425; and 6,382,526, all of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. A suitable electrospinning process is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,753,454, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
EXAMPLE 1
[0022] An example of the present invention comprises the synthesis of compact solid silica fibers as described below. A sol-gel solution is made by adding tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (44.7 mL, 0.2 M), ammonium hydroxide (18 mL, 0.2 M), and water (45 mL, 3.2 M) to a reaction vessel, which is topped off to 1 liter using ethanol (about 890 mL). Nylon 6 (20 wt % solution in formic acid) nanofibers are electrospun at 15 cm distance and 20 kV directly into the sol-gel solution. The sol-gel solution with the Nylon-6 fibers suspended therein is left at room temperature for about 20 hours without agitation. The particle size resulting from this process is about 100 nm. The nylon 6 web does not dissolve. The web is washed twice by suspending in ethanol and leaving titania nanofibers with 150 nm diameters as seen in FIG. 2C. Shrinkage in the diameter of the nanofibers is observed when the nanofibers are heated, due to the thermal degradation of the polymer.
EXAMPLE 3
[0023] In another example of the present invention hollow nanofibrous structures are formed according to the following process. In order to sol-gel coat 0.2 grams of nylon-6 nanofibers, 110 ml of filtered distilled water is added to 15.2 ml of 5 M nitric acid at room temperature. After mixing, 7.6 ml of 2-propanol is then slowly added. Next, 1.6 ml of titanium isopropoxide is gradually added with a pipette and the solution is ultrasonically agitated for 30 minutes. After half an hour the solution becomes transparent indicating the formation of a sol having nano-scale particles. The electrospun polymer nanofibers are then placed in the sol and the mixture is heated to 65.degree. C. for two hours. This induces the growth of titania nanoparticles on the surface of the nanofibers. The solution becomes cloudy after about two hours, indicating precipitation. The precipitate is separated from the solution by washing several times with methanol, which also removed residual alkoxides.
