For generating the necessary different clock phases the circuit 2 is used, which provides accurate time delays. The obtained multi-phase clock is used for driving the multiplexing circuits.
At first all data bits D1, D3, D2 and D4 are entered with the 0.degree. clock signal into the respective data inputs of flip-flops 28, 30, 32 and 34. Thereby all incoming data will be aligned with respect to the correct clock. The data bits D2 and D4 are delayed 90.degree. by means of the flip-flops 38 and 40, respectively. Thereafter multiplexing in pairs of D1 and D3, on the one hand, and of D2 and D4, on the other hand, is carried through by means of the respective 0.degree. and 90.degree. clock signals in the multiplexor stages 36 and 42, respectively. In the last multiplexor stage 44, the two data streams are multiplexed together by means of the composite clock which has been received from the gate 46 and has half the bit-frequency.
The clock CK.sub.out received from the gate 46 together with data D.sub.out from the output of the multiplexor stage 44 thus only has half the bit-frequency. This is part of a principle of not having a higher speed anywhere than maximum data speed. The great advantage of this solution is that it does not require any external clock with the high frequency otherwise needed for being able to operate.
Other multiplexing quotients than the one appearing from the description above are conceivable.
The demultiplexing circuit shown in FIG. 3 includes an input delay circuit 50 exactly corresponding to the delay circuit 2 of FIG. 1. Furthermore it includes a clock aligning circuit 52 and a demultiplexor proper 54, which will be described more closely below.
