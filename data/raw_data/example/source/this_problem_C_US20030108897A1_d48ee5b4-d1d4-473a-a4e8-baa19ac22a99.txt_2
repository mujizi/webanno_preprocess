[0275] The algorithm requires neither knowledge of the number of appearances of a given k-tuple in a nucleic acid sequence of the basic and ordering libraries, nor does it require the information of which k-tuple words are present on the ends of a fragment. The algorithm operates with the mixed content of k-tuples of various length. The concept of the algorithm enables operations with the k-tuple sets that contain false positive and false negative k- tuples. Only in specific cases does the content of the false k-tuples primarily influence the completeness and correctness of the generated sequence. The algorithm may be used for optimization of parameters in simulation experiments, as well as for sequence generation in the actual SBH experiments e.g. generation of the genomic DNA sequence. In optimization of parameters, the choice of the oligonucleotide probes (k-tuples) for practical and convenient fragments and/or the choice of the optimal lengths and the number of fragments for the defined probes are especially important.
[0276] This part of the algorithm has a central role in the process of the generation of the sequence from the content of k-tuples. It is based on the unique ordering of k-tuples by means of maximal overlap. The main obstacles in sequence generation are specific repeated sequences and false positive and/or negative k-tuples. The aim of this part of the algorithm is to obtain the minimal number of the longest possible subfragments, with correct sequence. This part of the algorithm consists of one basic, and several control steps. A two-stage process is necessary since certain information can be used only after generation of all primary subfragments.
[0277] The main problem of sequence generation is obtaining a repeated sequence from word contents that by definition do not carry information on the number of occurrences of the particular k-tuples. The concept of the entire algorithm depends on the basis on which this problem is solved. In principle, there are two opposite approaches: 1) repeated sequences may be obtained at the beginning, in the process of generation of pSFs, or 2) repeated sequences can be obtained later, in the process of the final ordering of the subfragments. In the first case, pSFs contain an excess of sequences and in the second case, they contain a deficit of sequences. The first approach requires elimination of the excess sequences generated, and the second requires permitting multiple use of some of the subfragments in the process of the final assembling of the sequence.
[0278] The difference in the two approaches in the degree of strictness of the rule of unique overlap of k-tuples. The less severe rule is: k-tuple X is unambiguously maximally overlapped with k-tuple Y if and only if, the rightmost k-1 end of k-tuple X is present only on the leftmost end of k-tuple Y. This rule allows the generation of repetitive sequences and the formation of surplus sequences.
[0279] A stricter rule which is used in the second approach has an addition caveat: k-tuple X is unambiguously maximally overlapped with k-tuple Y if and only if, the rightmost K-1 end of k-tuple X is present only on the leftmost end of k-tuple Y and if the leftmost K-1 end of k-tuple Y is not present on the rightmost end of any other k-tuple. The algorithm based on the stricter rule is simpler, and is described herein.
