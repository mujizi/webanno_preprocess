[0076] Referring to FIG. 14A, release member 320 is attached to mount plate 312, and includes a tab 322 to cooperate with projection 254 of pipe lift 252. FIG. 15 illustrates the pipe lift, including a projection 254 in alignment with each rod column. FIGS. 13 and 13A illustrate the function of tab 322. In this figure, pipe lift 252 has been raised, and the projection 254 of lift 252 has engaged tab 322, raising release member 320. Release member 320 is shaped to engage the pipe stops 280. In FIG. 13, the release member 320 has been raised by the pipe lift 252 to the point that the pipe stops 280 have been released in column 57, and the column of pipes is supported by pipe lift 252.
[0077] FIG. 14 illustrates the configuration resulting when the pipe lift 252 is lowered to move a pipe into pocket 221 of pipe transfer member 246 (FIGS. 12 and 12A). The pipe will contact mount plate 312, compressing the spring chamber 314. This compression will result in a repositioning of the 4-bar link 310 causing the release member 320 to separate from the projection 254 of the pipe lift 252.
[0078] FIGS. 16A-16H illustrate this process in more detail. FIG. 16A illustrates the transfer member 246 positioned at a second position or a transfer position, with the pocket 221 aligned with any one of the columns 57-60. As the transfer member 246 is moves to this position, from the first position, the assist arm 220 contacts the pin 306 of the release mechanism 300, and the two move together to the transfer position. As the release mechanism 300 moves to the transfer position, the release member 320 moves from a non-engagement position to an engagement position. In particular, roller 316 rides up the ramped frame 318 forcing the 4-bar link 310 to rotate up and move the release member 320 into the position shown (in FIG. 16A) to engage with one of the projections 254 of pipe lift 252. In this manner, the pipe release member 320 is positioned under the same column as the pocket 221.
[0079] FIG. 16B illustrates the pipe lift 252 as the pipe lift begins to rise. The projection 254 engages with tab 322 of the release member 320. Referring to FIG. 16C, the pipe lift 252 continues to rise towards the pipe column and moves release member 320 from a non-actuating position to an actuating position. In particular, the release member 320 is slidably connected to the mount plate 312 and slides relative to the mount plate 312 as it rises to the actuating position. Referring to FIG. 16D, in the actuating position, release member 320 engages and actuates the pipe stops 280 to release a pipe from the column. In FIG. 16 D, a pipes has dropped down and is being supported by pipe lift 252.
[0080] As shown in FIG. 16E, the pipe lift 252 lowers, causing the pipe to contact mount plate 312. The weight of the pipe forces the mount plate 312 to compress the spring chamber 314 and reposition the 4-bar link 310 such that the release member 320 begins to disengage from the pipe lift 252. Referring to FIG. 16F, the tab 322 of the release member 320 disengages, and drops by gravity into the home position. In FIG. 16G, the pipe lift 252 lowers the pipe into pocket 221 of transfer member 246, and as shown in FIG. 16H, the pipe lift 252 lowers to release the pipe. In this position, the pipe is supported by the transfer member 246 and is ready to be transported to the drive member 34.
