Example 82
4-propionyl-2-propyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0329]The compound of Example 54 (3.17 g) containing inseparable isomers was dissolved in toluene (72.5 mL). To this solution, activated manganese dioxide (6.31 g) was added and the mixture was stirred for 7 hours under reflux. Subsequently, additional activated manganese dioxide (6.31 g) was added and the mixture was stirred for another 6 hours under reflux. The insoluble material was removed by filtration and the filtrate was evaporated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=4:1). The resulting yellow oil was again oxidized and purified to afford the title compound as a yellow powder (850 mg).
