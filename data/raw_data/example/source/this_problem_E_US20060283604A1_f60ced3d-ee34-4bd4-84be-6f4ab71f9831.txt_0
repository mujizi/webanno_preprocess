[0004] The carrier liquid in the slurry normally flows into the formation and/or through the screen, itself, which, in turn, is sized to prevent gravel from flowing through the screen. This results in the gravel being deposited or "screened out" in the annulus between the screen and the well bore and forming a gravel-pack around the screen. The gravel, in turn, is sized so that it forms a permeable mass which allows produced fluids to flow through the mass and into the screen but blocks the flow of particulates into the screen.
[0005] It is often difficult to completely pack the entire length of the well annulus around the screen. This poor distribution of gravel (i.e. incomplete packing of the interval) is often caused by the carrier liquid in the gravel slurry being lost into the more permeable portions of the formation interval which, in turn, causes the gravel to form "sand bridges" in the annulus before all of the gravel has been placed. Such bridges block further flow of slurry through the annulus thereby preventing the placement of sufficient gravel (a) below the bridge in top-to-bottom packing operations or (b) above the bridge in bottom-to-top packing operations.
[0006] Alternate flow conduits, called shunt tubes, alleviate this problem by providing a flow path for the slurry around sand bridges. The shunt tubes are typically run along the length of the well screen and are attached to the screen by welds. Once the screen assemblies are joined, fluid continuity between the shunts on adjacent screen assemblies must be provided. Several methods have been attempted to provide such continuity.
[0007] U.S. Pat. No. 6,409,219, by Broome et al. describes a system wherein shunts on adjacent assemblies aligned when the correct torque is applied to join the assemblies. Alignment marks are included on the assemblies to indicate when the correct torque has been applied.
[0008] U.S. Pat. No. 5,341,880, by Thorstensen et al. describes a sand screen structure assembled from a plurality of generally tubular filter sections that may are axially snapped together in a manner facilitating the simultaneous interconnection of circumferentially spaced series of axially extending shunt tubes secured to and passing internally through each of the filter sections. In an alternate embodiment of the sand screen structure the shunt tubes are secured within external side surface recesses of the filter section bodies.
