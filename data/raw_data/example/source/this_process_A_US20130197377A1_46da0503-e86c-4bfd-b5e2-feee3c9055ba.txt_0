[0040] The cardiac signal processing apparatus 20 has an interface (not shown) for acquiring output (a cardiac signal) of the heartbeat sensor 10. The ADC 21 digitizes an analog cardiac signal acquired from the heartbeat sensor 10. The ADC 21 is not necessary when a digital signal can be acquired from the heartbeat sensor 10.
[0041] The signal digitized by the ADC 21 is sent to the LPF 25 by which the cardiac signal is removed and a respiratory signal (fundamental harmonics) is extracted. The normal heart rate is 60 to 180 beats per minute, that is, about 1 to 3 Hz, while the breathing rate is 10 to 20 breaths per minute, that is, about 0.15 to 0.3 Hz. Accordingly, the fundamental harmonics of the respiratory signal can be extracted from the cardiac signal by employing, as the LPF 25, a LPF which has a frequency between these values as a cutoff frequency. Since the respiratory signal is subjected to high frequency extrapolation processing as described later, the cutoff frequency of the LPF 25 is preferably determined such that a filtered signal contains not only fundamental harmonics of the respiratory signal but also several higher harmonics. FIG. 2A shows an example of filter characteristics of the LPF 25. In this example, the cutoff frequency of the LPF 25 is set to a frequency between a respiratory highest harmonics among frequencies lower than a fundamental frequency of a cardiac signal (a third harmonics in the shown example) and the fundamental frequency of the cardiac signal.
[0042] Since the higher harmonic component is removed from the respiratory signal by the LPF 25, the high frequency extrapolation filter 26 performs high frequency extrapolation processing to maintain a harmonic structure of the respiratory signal that is a quasi-periodic signal, so that a higher harmonic component of the respiratory signal is generated. Since this high frequency extrapolation processing is a well-known technique, detailed description thereof will be omitted here. Basically, the high frequency extrapolation processing is realized by copying an intermediate component of the respiratory signal (a higher harmonic component of the respiratory signal with a frequency equal to or lower than the cutoff frequency of the LPF 25) to a high frequency portion (equal to or higher than the cutoff frequency of the LPF 25) by unit of amplitude modulation. During this processing, the level of the high frequency portion is adjusted based on an envelope of frequency spectrum of the input respiratory signal.
[0043] After the respiratory harmonic component has been extrapolated by the high frequency extrapolation filter 26, the signal is input to the HPF 27, by which the higher harmonic component of the respiratory signal is extracted. As described later, the higher harmonic component of the respiratory signal is a component that is removed from a cardiac signal by the HPF 22. Therefore, the cutoff frequency of the HPF 27 is preferably the same or higher than the cutoff frequency of the HPF 22.
[0044] The cardiac signal digitized by the ADC 21 is input to the HPF 22, by which a respiratory signal is removed and a cardiac signal is extracted. In this embodiment, the cutoff frequency of the HPF 22 is the same as the cutoff frequency of the LPF 25 as shown in FIG. 2A. However, it may be different from the cutoff frequency of the LPF 25, as long as it is higher than a frequency that can separate a respiratory signal (fundamental harmonics) and a cardiac signal from an input signal, that is, a respiratory fundamental frequency, and lower than a cardiac fundamental frequency.
