[0176]In the W-APN acquisition request 701, the radio network controller 104 provides a request signal for obtaining the W-APN that constitutes the domain name part of the user ID from the mobile terminal 101.
[0177]The information fields of the mobile terminal 101 before the W-APN acquisition request 701 are as shown in state (a) of FIG. 6, the information fields held by the radio network controller, which will be described later, as shown in state (a) of FIG. 8, and the information fields held by the wireless access gateway 105 are as shown in state (a) of FIG. 9.
[0178]At this point in time, the following process is performed inside the radio network controller 104. When packet connection is established or when information relating to prediction such as information about the position and speed of the terminal 101 measured if the terminal measures its position is input from the terminal 101a into the radio network controller 104, the radio network controller 104 starts a process for predicting and registering a location to which the terminal 101 will move. The terminal control section 201 inside the radio network controller 104 detects a trigger for starting this process.
[0179]At first, only the information about the mobile terminal 101a that relates to the mobile communication network is set in the terminal information management section 202 of the radio network controller 104. This is shown in state (a) of FIG. 8. In state (a) in FIG. 8, ID1 is set as the IMSI of the terminal 101a, the cell ID M1 is set as the active set, and 10.2.2.2 is set as the remote IP address of the terminal 101a. The other fields are not set.
[0180]The terminal control section 201 attempts to acquire the W-APN, user profile, and the MAC address of the wireless LAN from the terminal 101a. For this purpose, the terminal control section 201 generates a W-APN acquisition request using the IMSI. The terminal control section 201 issues the request to the terminal 101a through the base station communication section 205.
