[0019] However, in the wide area network such as the Internet, the transfer jitter resulted in fluctuation of transmission characteristics of the transmission path is too large to ignore. Therefore, together with the decoder buffer (vbv buffer) within the codec specifications, the conventional terminal 202 often includes another buffer as the reception buffer 207 of FIG. 20 for transfer jitter absorption. If this is the case, however, another problem arises.
[0020] The capacity of such buffer included in the terminal for jitter absorption generally varies depending on the device type. Therefore, even if data is distributed under the same condition, the device with large buffer capacity can perform streaming playback with no problem, but the device with small buffer capacity cannot absorb the jitter enough and thus fails in streaming playback.
[0021] To solve this problem, for example, the buffer capacity for jitter absorption may be sufficiently increased by increasing memory amount in the terminal. However, the memory is the one mainly determining the price of the terminal, and as to the price, the cheaper is desirably the better. Also, if the buffer capacity for jitter absorption is too large, a time to access a specific frame resultantly takes longer, causing the user to feel irritated.
[0022] Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a streaming method for preventing streaming playback from being disturbed due to underflow and overflow of a buffer even if the buffer capacity in the terminal varies depending on device type, and even if the transmission capacity of the network fluctuates. Further, while preventing streaming playback from being disturbed, the streaming method can also reduce a time taken to access a specific frame.
[0023] The present invention has the following features to attain the object above.
