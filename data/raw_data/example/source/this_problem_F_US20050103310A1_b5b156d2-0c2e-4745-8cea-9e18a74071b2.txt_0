[0005] The fuel injector has a moving closing piston for opening and closing the injection openings that are oriented toward the combustion chamber. The closing piston protrudes into a closing pressure chamber so that it can be acted on with fuel pressure. This generates a force that acts on the closing piston in the closing direction. The closing pressure chamber and an additional chamber constitute a common working chamber; all of the partial regions of the working chamber are permanently connected to each other to permit the exchange of fuel.
[0006] With this design, triggering the pressure booster via the return chamber makes it possible to keep the triggering losses in the high-pressure fuel system low in comparison to a triggering by means of a working chamber that is intermittently connected to the high-pressure fuel shaft. In addition, the high-pressure chamber can only be pressure-relieved down to the pressure level of the high-pressure accumulator and not down to the leakage pressure level. On the one hand, this improves the hydraulic efficiency and on the other hand, permits a more rapid pressure increase up to the system pressure level so that the time intervals between injection phases can be reduced.
[0007] Pressure-controlled common rail injection systems with pressure boosters have the problem of not assuring the stability of the injection quantities to be injected into the combustion chamber, in particular the production of very small injection quantities of the kind required in preinjections. This is primarily due to the fact that the nozzle needle opens very quickly in pressure-controlled injection systems. As a result, very small variations in the triggering duration of the control valve can have powerful effects on the fuel quantity. Attempts have been made to remedy this problem by providing a separate needle stroke damper piston that delimits a damping chamber and must be guided in a high-pressure-tight clearance fit. This design does in fact permit a reduction of the needle opening speed, but on the other hand, it sharply increases the structural complexity and therefore the costs of the injection system.
[0008] In view of the ever-increasing standards regarding emissions and noise generation in autoignition internal combustion engines, further steps must be taken in the injection system in order to meet the stricter limit values to be expected in the near future.
[0009] In order to achieve the most flexible injection possible, systems with two solenoid valves have been developed. But since using two solenoid valves is complex and expensive, it would be desirable to use only one solenoid valve per injector/pressure booster combination. So far, a system of this kind has been controlled by means of a 3/2-way valve in order to produce multiple injections. These valves are complex in design and are difficult to manufacture with the required precision in series production because of the strict tolerances required.
