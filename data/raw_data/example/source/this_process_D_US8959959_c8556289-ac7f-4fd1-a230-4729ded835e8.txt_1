In one embodiment, the same combination of two ends of monofilament strands having different thicknesses may be used to form all of the various portions of fifth knit structure 1200. That is, the same combination of a thick monofilament strand having first diameter D1 and a thin monofilament strand having second diameter D2 may form the first knitted layer, the second knitted layer, as well as the cross tuck stitches extending between the first knitted layer and the second knitted layer. With this configuration for fifth knit structure 1200, only a single feeder including a spool having the two strands or ends of thick monofilament strand having first diameter D1 and thin monofilament strand having second diameter D2 is needed to knit the entire area of monofilament knit element 131 having fifth knit structure 1200. By only using a single feeder, the knitting process may be made more efficient and less time consuming for knitting knitted component 130 including monofilament knit element 131 than other knit structures that require multiple feeders and/or multiple spools of knitting material.
In various embodiments, any one or more of the knit structures described above in reference to FIGS. 8 through 12 may be usable together to form different areas of monofilament knit element 131 in knitted component 130. That is, in some embodiments, different areas of monofilament knit element 131 may incorporate different knit structures, including first knit structure 800, second knit structure 900, third knit structure 1000, fourth knit structure 1100, and/or fifth knit structure 1200, as well as other types of knit structures not disclosed herein but that are known in the art. Accordingly, knitted component 130 including monofilament knit element 131 with different knit structures may be provided with varying characteristics depending on the choice of knit structure in a particular area of monofilament knit element 131.
As described above with reference to knitted component 130, in some embodiments knitted component 130 may further include fusible strands. When a fusible strand is heated and fused to non-fusible yarns or non-fusible strands, this process may have the effect of stiffening or rigidifying the structure of knitted component 130. Moreover, by joining (a) one portion of a non-fusible yarn or strand to another portion of a non-fusible yarn or strand, and/or (b) non-fusible yarn or strand and inlaid tensile element 132 to each other has the effect of securing or locking the relative positions of non-fusible yarns or strands and inlaid tensile element 132, thereby imparting stretch-resistance and stiffness. That is, portions of non-fusible yarns or strands may not slide relative to each other when fused with fusible strands, thereby preventing warping or permanent stretching of monofilament knit element 131 due to relative movement of the knit structure. Additionally, inlaid tensile element 132 may not slide relative to monofilament knit element 131, thereby preventing portions of inlaid tensile element 132 from pulling outward from monofilament knit element 131. Accordingly, areas of knitted component 130 may be configured with both fusible and non-fusible yarns or strands within monofilament knit element 131.
FIGS. 13 through 15B illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a knitted component that incorporates a fusible strand within a knit element, such as monofilament knit element 131. Referring now to FIG. 13, a knit element 1300 incorporating one or more fusible strands combined with non-fusible strands is illustrated. In some embodiments, knit element 1300 may include a monofilament strand 1301 and a fusible strand 1302. In an exemplary embodiment, monofilament strand 1301 may be any of the monofilament strands in the exemplary embodiments described above. As seen in FIG. 13, knit element 1300 is formed by joining through knitting portions of monofilament strand 1301 and fusible strand 1302 along a plurality of courses to form knit element 1300.
In this embodiment, both of monofilament strand 1301 and fusible strand 1302 may be in the form of a monofilament strand that is extruded from a plastic or polymer material to form the monofilament strand. In one embodiment, monofilament strand 1301 may be made from a thermoset polymer material and fusible strand may be made from a thermoplastic polymer material. In an exemplary embodiment, the polymer materials forming monofilament strand 1301 and fusible strand 1302 may be compatible materials capable of bonding to each other when the thermoplastic polymer material cools after reaching its glass transition temperature. However, in other embodiments, the polymer materials forming monofilament strand 1301 and fusible strand 1302 may be incompatible materials such that only portions of fusible strand 1302 in contact with other portions of fusible strand 1302 may bond.
