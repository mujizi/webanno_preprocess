A steel pallet (plate) is held against the bottom of the mold by hard rubber blocks. Voids in the mold cavity are filled with cementitious materials and the mold assembly is caused to vibrate by the spinning of eccentric weights located on each end of the mold assembly. The cementitious materials begin to compact under vibration and a plunger is lowered to help compress the materials against the steel pallet by adding additional physical forces to the compacting forces caused by the vibration. Once the proper material density has been reached, as measured by the amount of material fed into the mold assembly, the length of the cycle time, and the measured height of the block, the vibration ceases. The steel pallet and a plunger are then lowered, stripping the block from the bottom of the mold. The pallet carrying the finished block then shuttles out of the apparatus and a new pallet is placed in position and raised against the bottom of the mold assembly. The cycle is then repeated.
Mold assembly wear is caused by the forming, compaction, and stripping of highly abrasive cementitious materials and by metal parts sliding against one another during the cycle and parts coming together during vibration. The wear pattern typical for a concrete block mold assembly is usually about 81/2" (22 cm) up the inside of the mold assembly. Thus, surface wear can occur by friction wherein the materials being vibrated and compacted abrade the surface of the mold or it can occur by impact erosion. In impact erosion, material is displaced from the surface of the mold by physical contact with other components of the mold assembly and the materials themselves being compacted in between components of the mold which are moving in opposite directions and at different rates of speed. This process continues until the surface condition of the mold assembly is unsuited for further use.
In an attempt to create satisfactory molds, solid, tungsten carbide plates, 90 to 100 mils thick, were cast and then bonded to flat surfaces of the mold, and more than a million cycles were completed with no appreciable wear. Coating thicknesses, the cost of the material, and the limitation of casting and applying the coating only on flat surfaces of the mold limited the usefulness of this solution to wear in the mold assembly.
Attempts have been made to increase the surface life of concrete-block molds by applying hard finishes; examples include flame spraying, plasma spraying, and hard chrome plate. Such expedients proved unsuccessful because of material porosity and limited surface adhesion. Other types of surface hardening treatments such as carburizing and nitrating are being used with varying degrees of success.
Udale, U.S. Pat. No. 1,536,952, and Sanborn, U.S. Pat. No. 4,571,983 show flame spray coating of steel working parts with refractory metal in order to increase the number of working cycles they can undergo. It should be noted that these patent disclosures deal with applications in which there is no direct physical contact between surfaces of the mold (e.g. relatively low forces are exerted between the respective surfaces). They disclose examples of materials being molded, pressed, formed, and sheared in dies designed with close fits and running tolerances. In the case of concrete-block apparatus, large mold assemblies and material masses moving in opposite directions and at different rates of speed are subject to abrasion and surface erosion through direct physical contact. This physical contact includes materials very hard in nature and deformation resistant which results in surface material being displaced and rapid erosion of the mold assembly.
