[0003] Currently, the relatively high price of biodiesel compared to diesel oils derived from petroleum is the main obstacle to their complete commercial acceptance. One way to make these procedures more economically viable would be to find new applications for crude glycerine. The procedures proposed to date for the use of crude glycerine are unsatisfactory and include mixing it with animal manure to produce fertilizers or incorporating it into animal feed. These applications are described, for example, in the article titled "Technical Uses of Fatty Acid Esters", Meffert, JAOCS, vol. 61, February 1984.
[0004] It is also known that the use of biodiesel fuels, comprised by methyl esters of fatty acids is limited in practice by their inferior properties at low temperature. For example, they present cloud points (lowest temperature at which a fluid can remain as a fluid without becoming turbid or beginning to crystallize) of almost zero (0) degrees centigrade whereas the petroleum-derived diesels present typical values of around -16.degree. C. A similar difference is found with the freezing points that are around -2.degree. C. for biodiesel oils and are around -27.degree. C. for petroleum-derived diesels (see for example the article "Low Temperature Properties of Triglyceride-Based Diesel Fuels: Transesterified Methyl Esters and Petroleum Middle distillate/Ester Blends, Dunn et al., JAOCS, vol 72, No 8, 1995). These inferior properties of the biodiesel compared to conventional diesels, with the subsequent reduction in fluidity at low temperature, causes problems such as the trapping of fuel filters in Diesel engines under 0.degree. C.
[0005] As a consequence, the use of biodiesel in cold weather cannot be generalized until this problem has been solved. Proposed solutions include so-called "winterization", discussed in the article titled "Reducing the Crystallization Temperature of Biodiesel by Winterizing Methyl Soyate", Lee et al. JAOCS, vol 73, No 5, 1996, the biotechnological application to generate biodiesel with improved specifications as described in "Vegetable Oils: From Table to Gas Tank", Chowdhury et al. Chem. Eng. February 1993, and the mixture of methyl esters of fatty acids with etherized glycerine, U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,501, January 2001. In the U.S. Pat. No. 5,520, 1996, the reaction of triglycerides with methanol are described in the presence of a base to produce methyl esters and a specific treatment to reduce the cloud point are described. However, the use of glycerine acetals or cetals to reduce the cloud point and the viscosity of methyl or ethyl esters of fatty acids are not mentioned.
[0006] The article "Glycerinderivate als Kraftstoffkompononenten", R. Wessendorf, Erdol und Kohle-Erdgas, 48, 3, 1995, describes the ethers, esters and glycerine oils as useful components of petrols but does not mention the effects the acetals have of reducing the viscosity and in general improving the properties in cold of their mixtures with methyl or ethyl esters of fatty acids.
[0007] Similarly, it is known (I. Barnes et al., presentation to the US/German Environmental Chamber Workshop, Riverside, Calif., Oct. 4-6, 1999) that the addition of acetals to diesel oils slightly improves the environmental characteristics of their exhaust gases. For example, trials on methylal additions (CH.sub.2(OCH.sub.3).sub.2 and n-butylal (C.sub.4H.sub.9OCH.sub.2OC.sub.4H.sub.9) to diesel oils of petroleum origin have demonstrated that the emission of particles and of NO.sub.x are greatly reduced and in the case of butylal the cetane number is also improved. However, the effect of improving the properties of the diesel oils in cold by acetal addition is not mentioned.
