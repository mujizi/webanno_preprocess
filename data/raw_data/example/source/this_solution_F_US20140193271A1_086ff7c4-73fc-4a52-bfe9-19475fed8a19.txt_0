[0016] Such grooves enable the reinforcement to be embedded in the blade. This embedding further improves retention of the reinforcement on the leading edge, in particular by providing mechanical retention in shear. In other words, the grooves prevent relative sliding between the reinforcement and the blade.
[0017] In other embodiments, the grooves are fabricated by machining, after the blade has been fabricated. This machining operation presents the advantage of being simple to perform, but it may lead to a reduction in the mechanical strength of the blade.
[0018] In certain embodiments, the grooves are fabricated by molding during fabrication of the blade. Compared with machining, this solution presents the advantage of leading to a smaller reduction in the mechanical strength of the blade.
[0019] In certain embodiments, the grooves have a profile that is flared in order to make it easier to deposit the metal coating in the bottoms of the grooves.
[0020] In certain embodiments, said metal coating is made of Ni, Al, or Ti, of an alloy based on Ni, Co, Al, or Ti, or of cermet. For example, it may comprise: [0021] an Ni-based alloy of the NiAl, NiCrAl, NiCrAlY type, and in particular an Ni-based alloy having 5% to 20% by weight of Al, e.g. Ni5Al, NiCr-6Al; [0022] an aluminum alloy having at most 12% by weight of Si; [0023] a so-called "strong" metal alloy based on Ni or Co that has a large content of additional metallic elements, e.g. CoMoCrSi, CoNiCrAlY; [0024] a cermet having a large content (preferably greater than 12% by weight) of a metallic element of the Co, Ni, Cu, Al type or of an alloy of these elements, e.g. WC12Co, WC17Co; or [0025] a lightly-alloyed alloy of Ti such as TA6V.
