[0602] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,352, "Polymeric materials can also be intermixed in a blend or co-polymer with the fibrin to produce a material with the desired properties of fibrin with improved structural strength. For example, the polyurethane material described in the article by Soldani et at., "Bioartificial Polymeric Materials Obtained from Blends of Synthetic Polymers with Fibrin and Collagen" International Journal of Artificial Organs, Vol. 14, No. 5, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference, could be sprayed onto a suitable stent structure. Suitable polymers could also be biodegradable polymers such as polyphosphate ester, polyhydroxybutyrate valerate, polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate and the like . . . " The polymeric material 14 may be, e.g., a blend of fibrin and another polymeric material.
[0603] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,352, "The shape for the fibrin can be provided by molding processes. For example, the mixture can be formed into a stent having essentially the same shape as the stent shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,062 issued to Wiktor. Unlike the method for making the stent disclosed in Wiktor which is wound from a wire, the stent made with fibrin can be directly molded into the desired open-ended tubular shape."
[0604] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,352, "In U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,736 issued to Muller et al., a dense fibrin composition is disclosed which can be a bioabsorbable matrix for delivery of drugs to a patient. Such a fibrin composition can also be used in the present invention by incorporating a drug or other therapeutic substance useful in diagnosis or treatment of body lumens to the fibrin provided on the stent. The drug, fibrin and stent can then be delivered to the portion of the body lumen to be treated where the drug may elute to affect the course of restenosis in surrounding luminal tissue. Examples of drugs that are thought to be useful in the treatment of restenosis are disclosed in published international patent application WO 91/12779 "Intraluminal Drug Eluting Prosthesis" which is incorporated herein by reference. Therefore, useful drugs for treatment of restenosis and drugs that can be incorporated in the fibrin and used in the present invention can include drugs such as anticoagulant drugs, antiplatelet drugs, antimetabolite drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs and antimitotic drugs. Further, other vasoreactive agents such as nitric oxide releasing agents could also be used. Such therapeutic substances can also be microencapsulated prior to their inclusion in the fibrin. The micro-capsules then control the rate at which the therapeutic substance is provided to the blood stream or the body lumen. This avoids the necessity for dehydrating the fibrin as set forth in Muller et al., since a dense fibrin structure would not be required to contain the therapeutic substance and limit the rate of delivery from the fibrin. For example, a suitable fibrin matrix for drug delivery can be made by adjusting the pH of the fibrinogen to below about pH 6.7 in a saline solution to prevent precipitation (e.g., NACl, CaCl, etc.), adding the microcapsules, treating the fibrinogen with thrombin and mechanically compressing the resulting fibrin into a thin film. The microcapsules which are suitable for use in this invention are well known. For example, the disclosures of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,897,268, 4,675,189; 4,542,025; 4,530,840; 4,389,330; 4,622,244; 4,464,317; and 4,943,449 could be used and are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, in a method similar to that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,736 issued to Muller et al., a dense fibrin composition suitable for drug delivery can be made without the use of microcapsules by adding the drug directly to the fibrin followed by compression of the fibrin into a sufficiently dense matrix that a desired elution rate for the drug is achieved. In yet another method for incorporating drugs which allows the drug to elute at a controlled rate, a solution which includes a solvent, a polymer dissolved in the solvent and a therapeutic drug dispersed in the solvent is applied to the structural elements of the stent and then the solvent is evaporated. Fibrin can then be added over the coated structural elements in an adherent layer. The inclusion of a polymer in intimate contact with a drug on the underlying stent structure allows the drug to be retained on the stent in a resilient matrix during expansion of the stent and also slows the administration of drug following implantation. The method can be applied whether the stent has a metallic or polymeric surface. The method is also an extremely simple method since it can be applied by simply immersing the stent into the solution or by spraying the solution onto the stent. The amount of drug to be included on the stent can be readily controlled by applying multiple thin coats of the solution while allowing it to dry between coats. The overall coating should be thin enough so that it will not significantly increase the profile of the stent for intravascular delivery by catheter. It is therefore preferably less than about 0.002 inch thick and most preferably less than 0.001 inch thick. The adhesion of the coating and the rate at which the drug is delivered can be controlled by the selection of an appropriate bioabsorbable or biostable polymer and by the ratio of drug to polymer in the solution. By this method, drugs such as glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone, betamethasone), heparin, hirudin, tocopherol, angiopeptin, aspirin, ACE inhibitors, growth factors, oligonucleotides, and, more generally, antiplatelet agents, anticoagulant agents, antimitotic agents, antioxidants, antimetabolite agents, and anti-inflammatory agents can be applied to a stent, retained on a stent during expansion of the stent and elute the drug at a controlled rate. The release rate can be further controlled by varying the ratio of drug to polymer in the multiple layers. For example, a higher drug-to-polymer ratio in the outer layers than in the inner layers would result in a higher early dose which would decrease over time. Examples of some suitable combinations of polymer, solvent and therapeutic substance are set forth in Table 1 below . . . ."
[0605] At column 7 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,352, some polymers that can be mixed with the fibrin are discussed. It is disclosed that: "The polymer used can be a bioabsorbable or biostable polymer. Suitable bioabsorbable polymers include poly(L-lactic acid), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) and poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-valerate). Suitable biostable polymers include silicones, polyurethanes, polyesters, vinyl homopolymers and copolymers, acrylate homopolymers and copolymers, polyethers and cellulosics. A typical ratio of drug to dissolved polymer in the solution can vary widely (e.g. in the range of about 10:1 to 1:100). The fibrin is applied by molding a polymerization mixture of fibrinogen and thrombin onto the composite as described herein." The polymeric material 14 may be, e.g., a blend of fibrin and a bioabsorbable and/or biostable polymer.
[0606] By way of yet further illustration, and referring to U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,696, the polymeric material can be a multi-layered polymeric material, and/or a porous polymeric material. Thus, e.g., and as is disclosed in claim 25 of such patent, "A polymeric material containing a therapeutic drug for application to an intravascular stent for carrying and delivering said therapeutic drug within a blood vessel in which said intravascular stent is placed, comprising: a polymeric material having a thermal processing temperature no greater than about 100.degree. C.; particles of a therapeutic drug incorporated in said polymeric material; and a porosigen uniformly dispersed in said polymeric material, said porosigen being selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, lactose, sodium heparin, polyethylene glycol, copolymers of polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide, and mixtures thereof." The "porsigen" is described at columns 4 and 5 of the patent, wherein it is disclosed that: "porosigen can also be incorporated in the drug loaded polymer by adding the porosigen to the polymer along with the therapeutic drug to form a porous, drug loaded polymeric membrane. A porosigen is defined herein for purposes of this application as any moiety, such as microgranules of sodium chloride, lactose, or sodium heparin, for example, which will dissolve or otherwise be degraded when immersed in body fluids to leave behind a porous network in the polymeric material. The pores left by such porosigens can typically be a large as 10 microns. The pores formed by porosigens such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethylene oxide/polypropylene oxide (PEO/PPO) copolymers, for example, can also be smaller than one micron, although other similar materials which form phase separations from the continuous drug loaded polymeric matrix and can later be leached out by body fluids can also be suitable for forming pores smaller than one micron. While it is currently preferred to apply the polymeric material to the structure of a stent while the therapeutic drug and porosigen material are contained within the polymeric material, to allow the porosigen to be dissolved or degraded by body fluids when the stent is placed in a blood vessel, alternatively the porosigen can be dissolved and removed from the polymeric material to form pores in the polymeric material prior to placement of the polymeric material combined with the stent within a blood vessel. If desired, a rate-controlling membrane can also be applied over the drug loaded polymer, to limit the release rate of the therapeutic drug. Such a rate-controlling membrane can be useful for delivery of water soluble substances where a nonporous polymer film would completely prevent diffusion of the drug. The rate-controlling membrane can be added by applying a coating from a solution, or a lamination, as described previously. The rate-controlling membrane applied over the polymeric material can be formed to include a uniform dispersion of a porosigen in the rate-controlling membrane, and the porosigen in the rate-controlling membrane can be dissolved to leave pores in the rate-controlling membrane typically as large as 10 microns, or as small as 1 micron, for example, although the pores can also be smaller than 1 micron. The porosigen in the rate-controlling membrane can be, for example, sodium chloride, lactose, sodium heparin, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide/polypropylene oxide copolymers, and mixtures thereof." The polymeric material 14 may comprise a multiplicity of layers of polymeric material.
