[0002] The present invention relates to a flexible electronic substrate and, in particular, to a molecularly flexible electronic substrate including a molecularly flexible dielectric adhesive having a low modulus of elasticity.
[0003] As semiconductor integrated circuit technology has advanced to greatly increase the amount and operating speed of the circuitry that can be fabricated on a single semiconductor chip, it has become more difficult to effectively utilize such integrated circuits due to the greatly increased number of input and output connections to the chip and the decreasing spacing or pitch of those connections. The connection problem has become more severe where the numbers of connections exceeds that conveniently or economically attainable in a conventional mechanical package.
[0004] One approach to solve this problem utilizes semiconductor chips mounted with contacts against and connecting to corresponding contacts on the next-level circuit board, the so-called "flip-chip" mounting, in which the contacts on the next-level circuit board are of substantially the same size and of the same pitch as are those on the semiconductor chip. Problems arise because the pitch of the semiconductor chip connections is much finer than the pitch attainable on conventional mechanical packages and printed wiring circuit boards to which such semiconductor chips are mounted. In addition, differences in thermal expansion between the semiconductor chip and the next-level circuit board produce thermally-induced stress that leads to failure or degradation of the interconnections when exposed to thermal cycling, which stress is often exacerbated by the rigidity of solder interconnections therebetween.
[0005] One solution to these problems employs an intermediate substrate between the semiconductor chip and the next-level circuit board to absorb some of the thermally-induced stress, and also to allow the fanning out of the connections to the semiconductor chip to permit a larger contact size and pitch that is compatible with conventional printed wiring circuit board technology. If the intermediate substrate is substantially larger than the size of the semiconductor chip, then the advantage of small chip size is lost, as is the advantage of short electrical lead length that improves the ability to operate the circuit at very high operating frequencies. While this has been addressed by reducing the size of the intermediate substrate and employing next-level substrate technologies capable of finer line widths and smaller features, the rigidity of the intermediate substrate has again posed some difficulties. Electronic packages where the perimeter of the intermediate substrate is no more than about 20% larger than the perimeter of the semiconductor chip mounted thereon are often referred to as "chip scale packages," although larger packages are often also referred to as "chip scale packages."
[0006] The difficulties of rigid intermediate substrates has been addressed by making the substrates of specialized materials that are referred to as being "flexible," such as thin polyimide and other so-called "flexible" conventional substrates on which printed wiring conductors and plated through holes can be formed by conventional methods. But, such substrate materials are not truly flexible in that they do not have a low modulus of elasticity, but only flex to a greater extent because they have been made of thinner material having a high modulus of elasticity. Conventional materials, such as polyimide sheet, have a high modulus of elasticity, e.g., a modulus greater than 70,000 kg/cm.sup.2 (1,000,000 psi). In addition, the use of such materials and conventional fabrication methods results in an increased cost that is undesirable and may require assembly processes that are more difficult or expensive to perform.
