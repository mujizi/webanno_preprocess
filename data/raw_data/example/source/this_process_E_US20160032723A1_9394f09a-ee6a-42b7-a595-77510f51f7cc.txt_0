[0035] The hydraulic unit 51 is connected via hydraulic lines 64.1 and 64.2 with the interior chamber 63. The interior chamber 63 and the hydraulic unit 51 are filled with a fluid, in particular a hydraulic fluid.
[0036] Referring to FIG. 4, the process for removing the chisel 30 from the chisel receiver 42 of the chisel holder 40 will be described. The tool is inserted into the bulge 45. In the process, the tool is centered with the support elements 61 and 69.1 on counter-faces of the base element 20 and of the chisel holder 40, so that it can be aligned. The support element 61 and the actuating member 70 aid the inserting movement, wherein the support element 61 acts against the cylindrical support element 39 of the chisel 30. The support elements 61 and 69.1 guide the tool perpendicularly with respect to the inserting movement, such as shown in FIG. 5.
[0037] When inserting the tool into the bulge 45, a cutout 69.2 in the support element 69.1 makes access to the chisel 30 possible, and the draw-in section 73 engages the groove 38 of the chisel 30. In this mounting position, it is possible to activate the hydraulic unit 51. During this, hydraulic fluid is conveyed through the hydraulic line 64.2, and the piston 66 is axially displaced in the direction toward the chisel 30. The flat push-off section 74 is simultaneously placed against the free end of the chisel 30. The chisel 30 is pushed out of the receiving bore 42 against the frictional force exerted by the clamping sleeve 35. During this process, the actuating unit 60 is supported by its support face 62 on the corresponding counter-face of the base element 20, as shown in FIG. 3. The front-side support face 69 is then released, which is shown by the spacing area having a dimension of 3 mm. The push-out movement of the piston 66 is limited at the closure insert 68.
[0038] The actuating member 70 is extended out of the chisel receiver 42 sufficiently far, so that the chisel is released and can be removed.
[0039] The process for mounting a chisel 30 will be described.
