EXAMPLE 21
1,2-Dihydro-2-[2'-(methylamino)ethyl]-3H-dibenz(deh)-isoquinoline-1,3-dione (22)
A mixture of 477 mg (1.5 mmol) of 2-[2'-(dimethylamino) ethyl]-1,2-dihydro-3H-dibenz(deh) isoquinoline-1,3-dione, 240 mg (1.5 mmol) of bromine, and 25 ml of glacial acetic acid was heated under reflux for 24 hours, cooled to room temperature, and diluted with ether. The solid that separated was dissolved in methanol and this solution was treated with methanolic KOH until it became slightly alkaline. It was then concentrated and the residue was separated into its components by column chromatography on silica gel with chloroform-methanol (19:1, then 9:1) as solvent. The first fraction (orange) gave 400 mg of unreacted starting material. The second fraction (green) gave a solid that was purified by preparative TLC on silica gel with chloroform-methanol (9:1) as solvent. This procedure gave 39 mg of the title compound, which formed a hydrochloride salt of m.p. 238.degree.-235.degree. C. (decomposition). The title compound provided the following analysis.
.sup.1 H NMR (CDCl.sub.3,TS), .delta. values in ppm. .delta.1.22 (s,1,HN), 2.55 (s,3NCH.sub.3), 3.06-3.11 (t,2,NCH.sub.2,), 4.39-4.44 (t,2,CON--CH.sub.2), 7.52-7.66 (m,2,H-5+H-9), 7.72-7.79 (t,1,H-10), 7.98-8.01 (d,1,H-8), 8.21-8.24 (d,1,H-4), 8.62-8.65 (d,1,H-6), 8.66 (s,1,H-7), 9.84-9.88 (d,1,H-11).
Alternatively, the title compound was prepared in 30% yield by the procedure described in Example 34, except that 1.5 equivalents of N-methylethylenediamine were used and the chromatography solvent was toluene-methanol (8.5:1.5). Crystallization from hexanestoluene (7:1) gave yellow crystals with m.p. 165.degree.-166.degree. C. and providing the following analysis.
