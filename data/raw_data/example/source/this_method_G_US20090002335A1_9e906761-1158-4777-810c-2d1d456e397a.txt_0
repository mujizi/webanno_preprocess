[0243]The method 450 also includes block 454 where an object is detected over the images at the first or second secondary positions located at the sides of the primary position. The method 450 also includes block 456 where the presence of an object over the secondary images is recognized as a navigation input.
[0244]The method 450 further includes block 458 where the images are transitioned through in accordance with the navigation input. For example, if the object is located on a first side, the images are moved in a first direction and if the object is located on the second side the images are moved in a second direction that is opposite the first direction. By way of example, if the object is located on the left side, then the images are moved to the left and if the object is located on the right, then the images are moved to the right. The number of positions the images move is generally dependent on the length of time the object is detected. For example, one (1) second of detection may be equal to five (5) image transitions. Furthermore, quick tap may be configured to move one transition. In this manner, the user can incrementally transition through images by tapping. In cases where a multi touch sensing surface is provided, the invention may further provide accelerated browsing based on the number of fingers present during a user action. For example, adding a second finger makes the traversal 2.times. faster, adding a third finger makes the traversal 3.times. faster and so on.
[0245]FIG. 32 is a method 500 of assigning an image to a list, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. This method may be performed at a host before downloading the list to the portable electronic device, or alternatively it may be performed at the portable electronic device.
[0246]The method 500 generally begins at block 502 where a file is created. The file may be a list of data items. The list may for example be a playlist containing a portion of songs from a large song library. The playlist is somewhat of a sub menu so that a user does not have to browse through a large library. It also serves the purpose of organizing songs into categories such as Dance Music or Mood Music, etc. It should be appreciated, that the file is not limited to playlists and other data may be contained in the file. For example, the file may be an address file containing contact information. Creating the file typically includes providing a heading or title to the file.
[0247]Following block 502, the method 500 proceeds to block 504 where an image is assigned to the file. The images may for example be selected from a photo library, a pdf library, etc. This may for example be accomplished by (1) selecting a file, (2) selecting Add Image in an operations menu so that a window that contains images is opened, (3) selecting an image from the window and thereafter (4) assigning the image to the playlist.
