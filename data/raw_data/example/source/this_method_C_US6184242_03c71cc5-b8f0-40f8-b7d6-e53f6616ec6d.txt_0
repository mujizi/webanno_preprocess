In step 1, an amino-protected benzylphenyl 3d is prepared by coupling compound 1d and compound 2d under Stille reaction conditions. For example, the reaction proceeds in the presence of lithiated compounds such as tert-butyllithium; tin compounds such as tributyltin halide; and a catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium. The reaction proceeds under an inert atmosphere in an aprotic solvent such as hexamethylphosphoramide, N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the like.
In step 2, a phenylamine compound of formula Ia is prepared by removing the amino-protecting group from compound 3d by treatment with a specific cleaving reagent, for example tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride. The reaction proceeds under an inert atmosphere in an aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the like.
Exemplary preparations of compounds of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compounds of formula Ia are described in detail in Examples 1-4. Exemplary preparations of compounds of formula 1d and 2d are described in detail in Preparations 1 and 2, respectively.
Scheme B
Scheme B describes an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 is a group represented by formula (A) and R.sup.3 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, halo, heterocyclyl, or --NR.sup.8 R.sup.9, from the corresponding intermediate compound of formula Ib. ##STR10##
