[0598] By way of yet further illustration, and referring to U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,352 (the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification), the polymeric material can comprise fibrin. As is disclosed in column 4 of such patent, "The present invention provides a stent comprising fibrin. The term "fibrin" herein means the naturally occurring polymer of fibrinogen that arises during blood coagulation. Blood coagulation generally requires the participation of several plasma protein coagulation factors: factors XII, XI, IX, X, VIII, VII, V, XIII, prothrombin, and fibrinogen, in addition to tissue factor (factor III), kallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, Ca+2, and phospholipid. The final event is the formation of an insoluble, cross-linked polymer, fibrin, generated by the action of thrombin on fibrinogen. Fibrinogen has three pairs of polypeptide chains (ALPHA 2-BETA 2-GAMMA 2) covalently linked by disulfide bonds with a total molecular weight of about 340,000. Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin through proteolysis by thrombin. An activation peptide, fibrinopeptide A (human) is cleaved from the amino-terminus of each ALPHA chain; fibrinopeptide B (human) from the amino-terminus of each BETA chain. The resulting monomer spontaneously polymerizes to a fibrin gel. Further stabilization of the fibrin polymer to an insoluble, mechanically strong form, requires cross-linking by factor XIII. Factor XIII is converted to XIIIa by thrombin in the presence of Ca+2. XIIIa cross-links the GAMMA chains of fibrin by transglutaminase activity, forming EPSILON-(GAMMA-glutamyl) lysine cross-links. The ALPHA chains of fibrin also may be secondarily cross-linked by transamidation."
[0599] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,352, "Since fibrin blood clots are naturally subject to fibrinolysis as part of the body's repair mechanism, implanted fibrin can be rapidly biodegraded. Plasminogen is a circulating plasma protein that is adsorbed onto the surface of the fibrin polymer. The adsorbed plasminogen is converted to plasmin by plasminogen activator released from the vascular endothelium. The plasmin will then break down the fibrin into a collection of soluble peptide fragments."
[0600] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,352, "Methods for making fibrin and forming it into implantable devices are well known as set forth in the following patents and published applications which are hereby incorporated by reference. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,736 issued to Muller et al., fibrin is clotted by contacting fibrinogen with a fibrinogen-coagulating protein such as thrombin, reptilase or ancrod. Preferably, the fibrin in the fibrin-containing stent of the present invention has Factor XIII and calcium present during clotting, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,523,807 issued to Gerendas, or as described in published European Patent Application 0366564, in order to improve the mechanical properties and biostability of the implanted device. Also preferably, the fibrinogen and thrombin used to make fibrin in the present invention are from the same animal or human species as that in which the stent of the present invention will be implanted in order to avoid cross-species immune reactions. The resulting fibrin can also be subjected to heat treatment at about 150.degree. C. for 2 hours in order to reduce or eliminate antigenicity. In the Muller patent, the fibrin product is in the form of a fine fibrin film produced by casting the combined fibrinogen and thrombin in a film and then removing moisture from the film osmotically through a moisture permeable membrane. In the European Patent Application 0366564, a substrate (preferably having high porosity or high affinity for either thrombin or fibrinogen) is contacted with a fibrinogen solution and with a thrombin solution. The result is a fibrin layer formed by polymerization of fibrinogen on the surface of the device. Multiple layers of fibrin applied by this method could provide a fibrin layer of any desired thickness. Or, as in the Gerendas patent, the fibrin can first be clotted and then ground into a powder which is mixed with water and stamped into a desired shape in a heated mold. Increased stability can also be achieved in the shaped fibrin by contacting the fibrin with a fixing agent such as glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde. These and other methods known by those skilled in the art for making and forming fibrin may be used in the present invention."
[0601] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,352, "Preferably, the fibrinogen used to make the fibrin is a bacteria-free and virus-free fibrinogen such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,540,573 to Neurath et al which is hereby incorporated by reference. The fibrinogen is used in solution with a concentration between about 10 and 50 mg/ml and with a pH of about 5.8-9.0 and with an ionic strength of about 0.05 to 0.45. The fibrinogen solution also typically contains proteins and enzymes such as albumin, fibronectin (0-300 .mu.g per ml fibrinogen), Factor XIII (0-20 .mu.g per ml fibrinogen), plasminogen (0-210 .mu.g per ml fibrinogen), antiplasmin (0-61 .mu.g per ml fibrinogen) and Antithrombin II (0-150 .mu.g per ml fibrinogen). The thrombin solution added to make the fibrin is typically at a concentration of 1 to 120 NIH units/ml with a preferred concentration of calcium ions between about 0.02 and 0.2M."
[0602] As is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,352, "Polymeric materials can also be intermixed in a blend or co-polymer with the fibrin to produce a material with the desired properties of fibrin with improved structural strength. For example, the polyurethane material described in the article by Soldani et at., "Bioartificial Polymeric Materials Obtained from Blends of Synthetic Polymers with Fibrin and Collagen" International Journal of Artificial Organs, Vol. 14, No. 5, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference, could be sprayed onto a suitable stent structure. Suitable polymers could also be biodegradable polymers such as polyphosphate ester, polyhydroxybutyrate valerate, polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate and the like . . . " The polymeric material 14 may be, e.g., a blend of fibrin and another polymeric material.
