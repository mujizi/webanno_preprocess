[0122] The table illustrates, by way of example, a mode of operation according to an embodiment of the invention in which Rch varies inversely with the load. That is, for heavier loads, Rch is less than for light loads. While the other parameters are shown as fixed in this example, they can be varied in different selectable wash cycles. When agitation is finished, the machine pauses until the water in the outer bowl rises to settle level, and then the drain pump starts. This process is added because, depending on the design, the spin bowl holes can be obstructed. This delays the flow of water from spin bowl to the outer bowl. Without this delay, there will be too much water left in spin bowl which may result in suds lock when the motor spins at high speed.
[0123] Because the inlet of drain pump is horizontal, an air lock may form in the pump which will effect to efficiency of draining. Shortening the "on" time will help to get rid of air lock in the drain pump while water in the outer bowl increases rapidly at high speed spin. This process assists in avoiding suds lock.
[0124] FIG. 17 illustrates an exploded view of an embodiment of the filter system according to an embodiment of the invention adapted for mounting on the case of the washing machine. The wall mount 17.180 is adapted to be attached to the wall of the machine case at an aperture around the edge of which the attachment flange 17.184 is used to attach the wall mount. The wall mount has a rear aperture 17.186 to which the filter system can be sealingly attached. Details of the sealing arrangement are well known to the person skilled in the technology and are not illustrated. The arrangement is adapted to enable the filter to be removed for periodic cleaning. A watertight closure 17.176 is provided to close the end of the filter arrangement in a known manner. The filter is modified by the addition of an extension 17.174 so the filter can be set back in the filter housing while providing an inlet opening 17.172 for the bowl drain inlet 17.032. The filter and extension can pass through the aperture 17.186 in the wall mount so the filter can be located in the filter housing 17.010 with the inlet port 17.032 aligned with aperture 17.172. The closure seals the end of the assembled filter and filter housing.
[0125] The self cleaning filter system of FIG. 17 has the filter oriented in a substantially horizontal orientation. The recirculation pump 17.056 supplies the recirculation pipe connection 17.104, which has its exit point at the highest level in order to avoid air entrapment. Air can freely exit the system during operation. The recirculation pipe connection can be inclined to facilitate the layout of the recirculation pipe.
