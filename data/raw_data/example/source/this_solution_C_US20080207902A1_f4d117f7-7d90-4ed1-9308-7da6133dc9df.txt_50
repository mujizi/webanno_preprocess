6-(7-methoxymethyl-2-trifluoromethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)-5-methy-l-4,5-dihydro-3-(2H)-pyridazinone
[1020]In an argon atmosphere, a 1 mol/L lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide/tetrahydrofuran solution (1.75 mL) was added to a solution of the compound of Example 329 (500 mg) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) at 0.degree. C. The mixture was stirred at 0.degree. C. for 30 min, followed by addition of t-butyl bromoacetate (321 .mu.L) and stirring at room temperature for another 30 min. A saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated. The product was dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL). To this solution, trifluoro acetic acid (7 mL) was added and the mixture was left at room temperature overnight. Subsequently, the mixture was concentrated and a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution was added to make the mixture basic. The mixture was then extracted with ether (100 mL). A 1 mol/L aqueous hydrochloric acid was added to the aqueous layer to make it acidic and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (200 mL). The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The extract was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in ethanol (30 mL). Hydrazine monohydrate (255 .mu.L) was added and the mixture was refluxed for 4 hours. Subsequently, the mixture was concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=3:2) to afford the title compound as a pale yellow powder (215 mg).
