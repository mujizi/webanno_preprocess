To a suspension of the product from step (d) (0.40 g) and step (e) (0.28 g) in dichloromethane (20 ml) was added N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.89 ml), the resulting solution was then stirred at room temperature for 7 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated and the residue taken up in methanol (45 ml)/2N HCl (5 ml), this solution was then stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated and the residue partitioned between water (50 ml) and dichloromethane (50 ml), the organics were dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated. The product was purified (HPLC, Novapak.RTM. C18 column, 0.1% aqueous ammonium acetate:acetonitrile, 50:50) to afford the title compound (0.44 g).
