A conservative assumption would be to assume that the low-frequency cutoff for wind and electronic noise is approximately 100 Hz. With this assumption, the time constant .alpha. is 10 milliseconds. Examining Equations (26) and (29), one can observe that, for small spacing (d on the order of 2 cm), the value of T.apprxeq.60.mu. seconds, and thus R(T).apprxeq.1. Thus, .beta..sub.opt-noise.apprxeq.-1 (30)
Equation (30) is also valid for the case of only a single microphone exposed to the wind noise, since the power spectrum of the exposed microphone will dominate the numerator and denominator of Equation (26). Actually, this solution shows a limitation of the use of the back-to-back cardioid arrangement for this one limiting case. If only one microphone was exposed to the wind, the best solution is obvious: pick the microphone that does not have any wind contamination. A more general approach to handling asymmetric wind conditions is described in the next section.
From the results given in Equation (30), it is apparent that, to minimize wind noise, microphone thermal noise, and circuit noise in a first-order differential array, one should allow the differential array to attain an omnidirectional pattern. At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive since an omnidirectional pattern will allow more spatial noise into the microphone output. However, if this spatial noise is wind noise, which is known to have a short correlation length, an omnidirectional pattern will result in the lowest output power as shown by Equation (30). Likewise, when there is no or very little acoustic excitation, only the uncorrelated microphone thermal and electronic noise is present, and this noise is also minimized by setting .beta..apprxeq.-1, as derived in Equation (30).
