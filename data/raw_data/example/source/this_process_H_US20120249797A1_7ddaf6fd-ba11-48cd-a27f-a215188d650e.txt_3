[0686] It should be understood that while digital cameras are used in this contactless system, other imagers may be used, such as active pixel imagers, CMOS imagers, imagers that image in multiple wavelengths, CCD cameras, photo detector arrays, TFT imagers, and so forth. It should also be understood that while polarized light has been used to create two different images, other variations in the reflected light may also be used. For example, rather than using polarized light, white light may be used and then different filters applied to the imagers, such as a Bayer filter, a CYGM filter, or an RGBE filter. In other embodiments, it may be possible to dispense with a source of polarized light and instead use natural or white light rather than a source of polarized light.
[0687] The use of touchless or contactless fingerprinting has been under development for some time, as evidenced by earlier systems. For example, U.S. Pat. Appl. 2002/0106115 used polarized light in a non-contact system, but required a metallic coating on the fingers of the person being fingerprinted. Later systems, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,651,594 and U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. 2008/0219522, required contact with a platen or other surface. The contactless system described herein does not require contact at the time of imaging, nor does it require prior contact, e.g., placing a coating or a reflective coating on the body part of interest. Of course, the positions of the imagers or cameras with respect to each other should be known for easier processing.
[0688] In use, the contactless fingerprint system may be employed at a checkpoint, such as a compound entrance, a building entrance, a roadside checkpoint or other convenient location. Such a location may be one where it is desirable to admit some persons and to refuse entrance or even detain other persons of interest. In practice, the system may make use of an external light source, such as a lamp, if polarized light is used. The cameras or other imagers used for the contactless imaging may be mounted on opposite sides of one set of augmented reality glasses (for one person). For example, a two-camera version is shown in FIG. 8F, with two cameras 870 mounted on frame 864. In this embodiment, the software for at least processing the image may be contained within a memory of the augmented reality glasses. Alternatively, the digital data from the cameras/imagers may be routed to a nearby datacenter for appropriate processing. This processing may include combining the digital data to form an image of the print. The processing may also include checking a database of known persons to determine whether the subject is of interest.
[0689] Alternatively, one camera on each of two persons may be used, as seen in the camera 858 in FIG. 8F. In this configuration, the two persons would be relatively near so that their respective images would be suitably similar for combining by the appropriate software. For example, the two cameras 6705 in FIG. 67 may be mounted on two different pairs of augmented reality glasses, such as on two soldiers manning a checkpoint. Alternatively, the cameras may be mounted on a wall or on stationary parts of the checkpoint itself. The two images may then be combined by a remote processor with memory 6707, such as a computer system at the building checkpoint.
[0690] As discussed above, persons using the augmented reality glasses may be in constant contact with each other through at least one of many wireless technologies, especially if they are both on duty at a checkpoint. Accordingly, the data from the single cameras or from the two-camera version may be sent to a data center or other command post for the appropriate processing, followed by checking the database for a match of the palm print, fingerprint, iris print, and so forth. The data center may be conveniently located near the checkpoint. With the availability of modern computers and storage, the cost of providing multiple datacenters and wirelessly updating the software will not be a major cost consideration in such systems.
