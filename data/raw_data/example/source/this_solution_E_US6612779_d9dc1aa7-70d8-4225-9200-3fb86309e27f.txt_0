According to another aspect of the invention, a method has been provided for the construction and the waterproofing of dams designed for retaining water in a reservoir, in which the dam comprises a body in coarse loose material, made of superimposed and compacted layers in earth and/or rock or similar, and a waterproofing membrane in an elastically yieldable synthetic material, extending from the dam body foundation to the crest, and longitudinally on an upstream face of the dam, the waterproofing membrane being fastened by means of strips of said elastically yieldable synthetic material, previously embedded between superimposed layers of loose material of said body of the dam, and successively welded to the waterproofing membrane during the construction and the installation on the above-mentioned upstream face.
According to a particular aspect of the invention, the waterproofing membrane is built on the upstream face of the dam already completed, by adjoining several sheets in synthetic material which are unrolled from the top to the bottom of the dam and welded to the anchoring strips embedded in the dam body during its construction.
According to another particular aspect of the invention, the waterproofing membrane is built on the upstream face of the dam by adjoining several sheets in synthetic material which are laid horizontally in respect to the longitudinal axis of the dam and welded to anchoring strips in synthetic material embedded in the dam body during the construction of the dam itself. This solution is particularly advantageous if compared to the previous ones because it allows an anticipate, although partial use of the dam, during its construction, without having to wait for the long time normally required for the stabilsation and testing of the dam after completion.
In the solution with the waterproofing membrane laid directly on the upstream face of the dam, the use of a waterproofing synthetic material, flexible and elastically extensible, coupled and adherent to a substrate in if synthetic material, such as a geotextile or similar, besides supplying a mechanical protection against any accidental puncturing of the waterproofing membrane by the loose material of the dam, supplies also surface with a high friction coefficient. This surface with high friction coefficient allows to maintain in their position the single sheets of the membrane during their installation, even if they are not yet welded to the anchoring strips.
The connection between the anchoring strips and the waterproofing membrane can be executed by thermo-welding in accordance with specific methods further explained, by using in any case for the waterproofing membrane and for the anchoring strips, synthetic materials that are chemically compatible for their heat-welding.
