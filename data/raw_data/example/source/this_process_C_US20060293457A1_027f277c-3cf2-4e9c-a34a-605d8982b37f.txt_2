[0127] The melt temperature of thermoplastic polymers used to produce thermoplastic vulcanizates may be as low as 40-120.degree. C., for example syndiotactic polypropylene, whereas the melting point of nylon, for example, can be as high as 350.degree. C. The friction and viscous dissipation created in the material, as it is sheared and dispersed, determines the temperature of the material in the melt zone. As the pellets or granulated material begins to melt, friction decreases, and the temperature levels off, but can be further manipulated depending on processing requirements. Cross-linking of rubber, depending somewhat on the functional groups present, and the chemistry of the rubber, usually takes place between 165 and 250.degree. C., and for most rubbers used in the processing of thermoplastic vulcanizates, cross-linking takes place between 175 and 230.degree. C.
[0128] Residence times for the processing using the ring extruder were determined empirically by adding color to the feed throat of the extruder after the start of extrusion from the die, and measuring the time it took for a color change to appear at the extrusion die. In one such test, a ring extruder having a feed rate of 100 kg/hr at 400 RPM showed a residence time of 44 seconds. For desired properties, residence times of 15 to 180 seconds are required, depending on the materials being processed.
[0129] Because there is a delay in cross linking while the ingredients mix during extrusion, and because temperatures are developed more gently and because mixing is taking place in these flow zones, large agglomerations of cross-linked elastomer are not formed. That is, small, fully cross linked particles are formed under high shear, and the cross linking and the thermoplastic phase prevents the cross linked particles from combining with additional elastomer as extrusion continues. The ring extruder facilitates this process by providing an efficient mixing. It has been discovered, as illustrated below, that increased cross linking can be obtained using the processes of the invention, while the energy required for processing is reduced.
[0130] It has also been discovered, as illustrated in EXAMPLE 2 below, that the mixing is sufficiently efficient that reduced amounts of curatives can be used to produce product having desired properties. In EXAMPLE 2, it is shown that what was considered by the prior art to be the optimal amount of curative can be replaced by about 0.75 of the prior art amount, and substantially similar properties can be achieved.
[0131] As is apparent from the foregoing description and the following examples, a mixture of two or more thermoplastic polymers may be used to form a thermoplastic vulcanizate, and mixtures of two or more rubbers may be used. Catalysts may be added in solid form or in solution, and solution catalysts may be concentrated or dilute. Oil may be added in one location or a plurality of locations, in order to control the temperature and the consistency of the composition as it is being processed, as well as to control the properties of the vulcanizate.
