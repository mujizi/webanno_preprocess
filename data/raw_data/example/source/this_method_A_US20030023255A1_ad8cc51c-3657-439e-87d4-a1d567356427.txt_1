[0099] The ventricular assist- or heart replacement-device 52, is then attached to the inflow conduit 20 of the cannulation assembly 10 and the outflow conduit 54 of the aortic anastomosis 50. First, the pump inlet 53 of the pump 52 is attached to the closed inlet isolation valve such as 30 of FIG. 2. Next, the pump outlet 55 is connected to a closed outlet conduit isolation valve such as 30 of FIG. 2 which is attached to the aorta 51 by means of the outflow conduit 54. The pump 52 is now connected to the patient's circulatory system. Flow through the pump 52 is prevented by the isolation valves such as 30 of FIG. 2, thus preventing the introduction of air from the pump 52 or the surroundings into the patient's circulatory system.
[0100] Following this, the pump 52 is de-aired by introducing saline solution into the de-airing port 46 of the inlet isolation valve such as 30 of FIGS. 2, 4, and 5, while withdrawing air (and saline) at the pump outlet isolation valve such as 30 of FIGS. 2, 4, and 5. If desired, the pump 52 may be operating during this step to aid the passage of air through to the outflow conduit 54. After air has been removed, the de-airing ports 46 may be closed in both isolation valves. The function of the pump 52 may then be observed by activating it and ensuring proper operation.
[0101] To begin use, the isolation valves such as 30 of FIGS. 2, 4, and 5, on both ends of the pump 52 are opened to allow blood flow. In embodiments of this method, isolation valves such as 30 of FIGS. 2, 4, and 5; isolation valve 130 of FIG. 7, and isolation valve 230 of FIG. 8 may be used in the invention. Sealing connections are then made at inflow 53 and outflow 55 connections of the pump. At this point, the isolation valves may be disconnected and removed from the patient and all connections may be verified for completeness.
[0102] To remove the valves, the inflow conduit 20 and outflow conduit 54 are first connected to the pump 52 through the inside of the respective isolation valves. The isolation valve housings such as 34, 36 of FIG. 2 may then be removed from the pump inlet 53 and outlet 55, while the seal is retained. A screw ring such as 28 of FIG. 1 may then be attached to retain and fixate the pump 52 and conduits 20, 54. The pump 52 is now operating inside the patient's circulatory system and may be placed and restrained as the surgeon sees fit. The pump 52 is then operated as desired.
[0103] The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its structures, methods, or other essential characteristics as broadly described herein and claimed hereinafter. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative, and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description. All changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
