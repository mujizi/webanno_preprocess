Example 133
7-cyano-2-ethyl-4-propionyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0442]The compound of Example 110 (300 mg) was dissolved in DMF (10.0 mL). To this solution, copper cyanide (147 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred at 100.degree. C. for 3 hours. Subsequently, additional copper cyanide (16.4 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred at 100.degree. C. for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was diluted with water and filtered through Celite. The filtrate was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification of the residue by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=4:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (175 mg).
