[0003] According to a conventional technique for producing a silica aerogel-containing mat, a silica precursor solution is impregnated into a matrix composed of an aluminosilicate-glass filament, a polyacrylonitrile fiber, a carbon fiber, a polyester fiber, a bicomponent fiber or a combination thereof. The silica aerogel-containing mat produced by the technique is a composite in which a silica aerogel is bound to the fiber. Two methods are known for producing silica aerogel-containing composites. The first method is to impregnate a silica precursor solution into a fiber matrix (see Korean Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-2004-0030462). The second method is to pour a solution of silica aerogel particles into a fiber matrix (see Korean Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 10-1999-0044558 and 10-2007-0100738).
[0004] Impregnation with a silica precursor solution, solidification into a gel and subsequent hydrophobic modification tend to cause chemical damage to ceramic fiber components, weaken the binding strength between the fiber and an aerogel, and cause separation of a powder of the aerogel from a final composite after drying.
[0005] When attempting to produce a composite of aerogel particles and a fiber, the aerogel particles are pulverized to a size of 1 mm or less, for example, 30 to 500 .mu.m and the fiber is limited to a diameter of 1 to 18 .mu.m to ensure good mechanical stability of the composite. More desirably, the composite is constructed such that the fine aerogel particles are sufficiently suspended within a mat. However, the composite has the problem of low adhesive strength because the aerogel particles are suspended between the pores of the fiber. To solve this problem, an adhesive and/or a coupling agent are further used to prevent the aerogel particles from separating or falling apart.
[0006] Ceramic fibers that are mainly used at present as high-temperature thermal insulation materials in Korea have an average diameter of 3 .mu.m and a thermal conductivity of 0.036 W/mK at room temperature, which is about twice higher than that (0.018 W/mK) of silica aerogels. Due to the higher thermal conductivity of the ceramic fibers, the thermal properties of matrix components supporting the skeleton of a composite disadvantageously deteriorate the overall thermal performance of the composite. Further, the use of a silica precursor solution or a silica aerogel powder for the production of a composite is limited in increasing the relative proportion of the silica aerogel in the composite. The low concentration (<10%) of silica in water glass as a silica precursor solution and the limitations resulting from a discontinuous batch process in a unit process of ambient or supercritical drying after gelation make it impossible to completely convert the silica into a silica aerogel. A maximum concentration of silica in commercially available blankets is known to be 40%. The limited relative proportion of the silica aerogel ultimately leads to deterioration in the thermal performance of the final product.
[0007] A blanket commercially available from Aspen Aerogels as a silica aerogel composite possesses a conductivity as low as 0.017 W/mK, which is a level similar to that of silica aerogels. However, the low conductivity of the blanket appears to be because of complex results derived from a fiber web having a thermal conductivity of 0.030 W/mK or less as a constituent material of the blanket, a complementary material additionally absorbing infrared rays (IR) and a coating of heat-reflecting thermal insulation components, such as aluminum.
