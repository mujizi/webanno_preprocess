The first master 110 can be formed by etching the surface of a suitable substrate. This substrate is not limited to any particular material so long as it is etchable, but it is preferably of silicon or quartz because of the ease with which these materials can be etched to form high precision color recesses 112.
A color pattern layer 100 is then formed in the color recesses 112 of the first master 110. This process is identical to that shown in FIG. 3(A) and described above, and the color pattern layer 100 can thus be formed by filling the color recesses 112 with a pigment 62 using an ink jet head 64.
Next, the surface of the first master 110 on which the color pattern layer 100 is formed, and the curved parts 22 side of a second master 20 identical to that used in the first embodiment described above, are bonded with a first light transmitting layer precursor 122 therebetween. This process is the same as that used for bonding by means of intervening light transmitting layer precursor 32 of the first embodiment. The light transmitting layer precursor 122 can also be selected from the materials available for use as the above-noted light transmitting layer precursor 32.
A first light transmitting layer 120 is thus formed between the first and second masters 110 and 20 as shown in FIG. 4(C). To spread the light transmitting layer precursor 122 over the specific area, a specific pressure can be applied to at least one of the masters 110 and 20. A setting process appropriate to the composition of the light transmitting layer precursor 122 is then applied through either or both master 110 and 20 to set the light transmitting layer 120.
The color pattern layer 100 formed in the color recesses 112 of the first master 110 is bonded to one side of the first light transmitting layer 120. A plurality of lenses 124 transferred from the profile of the curved parts 22 is formed on the other side of the first light transmitting layer 120.
