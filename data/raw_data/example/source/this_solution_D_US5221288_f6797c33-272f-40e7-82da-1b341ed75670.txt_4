Example 5
Photochromic microcapsules were exhausted into a cotton T-shirt (150 parts, smooth knit), and the T-shirt was rinsed with water and dehydrated in the same manner as in Example 4.
Next, 3000 parts of water and 15 parts (solid content=about 4.5 parts) of BINDER MR-10 (trade name, acrylate resin binder, product of Matsui Shikiso Chemical Co., Ltd.) were added and this solution was gradually heated to 70.degree. C., at which temperature it was treated 15 minutes and then dehydrated and dried.
The obtained T-shirt showed the same color changes as in Example 4 and had good appearance and touch. Moreover, the color fastness to rubbing and color fastness to washing were better than those of the T-shirt of Example 4.
