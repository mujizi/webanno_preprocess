2-ethyl-7-methoxy-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-carboaldehyde
[1083]The compound of Example 58 (11.23 g) was dissolved in chloroform (540 mL). To this solution, manganese dioxide (15.7 g) was added at room temperature and the mixture was stirred at 50.degree. C. for 2 hours. Subsequently, additional manganese dioxide (15.7 g) was added and the mixture was stirred at 50.degree. C. for another 2 hours. The insoluble material in the mixture was removed by filtration through Celite. The solvent of the filtrate was evaporated to afford the title compound as a yellow powder (10.76 g).
