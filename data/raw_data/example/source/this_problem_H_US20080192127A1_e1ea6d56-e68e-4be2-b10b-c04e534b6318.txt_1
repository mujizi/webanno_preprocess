[0229]Consequently, compared with the case of the AD conversion processing of the reference signal comparison type performed by using the DA converter 27a according to the comparative example, AD conversion processing in 1 LSB units is realized while the reference signal Vslop is controlled by 4 LSB every time the AD conversion processing is performed. There is an advantage that, even if frequencies of the count clock CK0 and the count clock CKdac are not increased, time necessary for AD conversion is substantially reduced to a quarter. Since the time necessary for AD conversion can be quartered, it is possible to quadruple speed of AD conversion processing while maintaining bit resolution and controlling an increase in power consumption in the counter unit 254.
[0230]In the basic example described above, it is assumed that time necessary for switching of the switch 310 in the reference-signal control unit 25 and a comparison operation in the voltage comparing unit 252 is sufficiently short and is also sufficiently short compared with time in which a potential of the reference signal Vslop changes 4 LSB. However, actually, time is not short in some case.
[0231]To solve this problem, as in the second example as a modification of the first example, since a processing delay occurs every time the reference signal Vslop is switched to perform comparison processing, it is sufficient to increase, according to the processing delay clock width .beta., a level difference between adjacent ones of the reference signals Vslop_4, Vslop_3, Vslop_2, and Vslop_1 to "1+2.beta." LSB rather than 1 LSB and perform an AD conversion operation in synchronization with a count operation in the counter unit 254. When the reference signal Vslop_4 is set as a reference, the reference signal Vslop_3 is set "1+2.beta." LSB higher, the reference signal Vslop_2 is set 2*(1+2.beta.) LSB higher, and the reference signal Vslop_1 is set 3*(1+2.beta.) LSB higher.
[0232]In order to increase a potential of the reference signal Vslop_1 by "k*(1+2.beta.)" LSB, a circuit configuration corresponding to the increase only has to be adopted. For example, a resistance value of the resistive element 332 only has to be set "1+2.beta." times as large as a resistance value of the resistive element 330.
[0233]In the reference-signal selecting unit 300, when the comparison pulse COMP is inverted in comparison of the reference signal Vslop_4 as a pre-stage reference signal and the pixel signal voltage Vx (i.e., when the comparison pulse COMP becomes the L level), the reference signal Vslop_4 is switched to any one of the remaining reference signals. Thereafter, the remaining reference signals are switched in order with a timing difference of a count step of the counter unit 254. Consequently, it is possible to align a period from every switching of a reference signal to comparison processing to an AD unit Tad. It is also possible to set values at respective timing points of the reference signals Vslop, a level of each of which is different by "1+2.beta." LSB, practically the same as the reference signal Vslop(T) and compare the values.
