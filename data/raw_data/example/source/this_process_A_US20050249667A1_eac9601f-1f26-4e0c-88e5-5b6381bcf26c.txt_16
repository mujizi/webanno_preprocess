[1261] Referring to FIG. 57, the target organ is insonified with sonic energy from a sonic energy emitter at the actual resonant frequency determined in step 9030 of FIG. 48. The minimum power level of sonic energy at the resonant frequency required to break the microtubule-chromosome bonds is determined by the process depicted in FIG. 57. FIG. 57 depicts the signal from the sonic energy receiver as the target organ is insonified at various power levels. At lower power levels, e.g., 8068 and 8070, the signal from the sonic energy receiver remains constant over time. At a threshold power level 8072, the signal from sonic energy receiver transitions at region 8074 to a higher level 8076. Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, applicants believe transition region 8074 occurs as the microtubule-chromosome bonds are breaking or the microtubules of the mitotic spinal are breaking or disassembling, thereby resulting in decreased absorption of the sonic energy and therefore a higher signal 8076 from the sonic energy receiver. There is no need to increase the power level beyond the minimum level required to break the mitotic spindle. The results depicted in FIGS. 56 and 57 are one possible outcome of the process depicted in FIG. 48. It should be understood that depending upon, the nature of the organ and cells being treated, other outcomes are possible.
[1262] Thus, again referring to FIG. 48, a sonic energy therapeutic regimen 9000 has the potential to act as a monitor of cell division and proliferation in a tumor mass or neoplastic group of cells and thereby can provide the clinician with a valuable set of information not previously available except by surgical biopsy or autopsy. This information can provide insight into the resistance of a group of cells to any conventional treatment and provide information useful to a tailoring of treatments to an individual patient's needs.
[1263] FIG. 58 depicts a process 10000 for combining sonic energy therapy with a second therapeutic agent. It should be recognized that this process is an extension of process 9000 in FIG. 48, and therefore, like steps are numbered identically. Referring to FIG. 58, steps 9010 through 9060 optimize the sonic energy therapeutic regimen, this creating a baseline for evaluation of the effect of introducing the second therapy. Step 9065 comprises insonification of the target organ with ultrasonic energy with the modified sonic energy regimen determined in step 9060 while simultaneously treating with a second therapy. By way of example, but not limitation, the second therapy may be thermal therapy, radiation, pharmaceutical therapy, or the like. By way of further example, the second regimen may be a combination of two or more therapies. The object of step 9070 is to determine the synergistic impact of a second therapeutic agent on the rate and effectiveness of the sonic energy treatment or vice versa. One object of this embodiment is to use a second therapeutic agent to increase the rate and effectiveness of the sonic energy treatment in disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the target organ cells.
[1264] Referring again to FIG. 58, step 9080 repeats the entire process of steps 9030 through 9070 numerous times during which the conditions of the insonification step and the second therapeutic agent step are altered. Each variation in steps 9030 and 9065 in ways that are described elsewhere in this disclosure or convention methods well known to those skilled in the art. By way of example, the second therapeutic agent may be incrementally increased or decreased. The object of this step is the accumulation of a data set in step 9070. Comparison of the accumulated data sets in 9080 allow for the identification of conditions in which microtubules are most effectively disassembled by the combined therapy of insonification and the second therapeutic agent.
[1265] In one preferred embodiment, the response seen at step 9070 includes decrease in time and increase in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the second therapeutic agent at or about the same time that it encounters sonic energy of said frequency and strength. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9070 includes an increase in time and decrease in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the second therapeutic agent at or about the same time that it encounters sonic energy of said frequency and strength. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9070 includes decrease in time and decrease in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the second therapeutic agent at or about the same time that it encounters sonic energy of said frequency and strength. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9070 includes an increase in time and increase in rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the second therapeutic agent at or about the same time that it encounters sonic energy of said frequency and strength. In another embodiment, the response seen at step 9070 includes no change in time or rate of disassembly of the mitotic spindle of the cells that encounters the second therapeutic agent at or about the same time that it encounters sonic energy of said frequency and strength.
