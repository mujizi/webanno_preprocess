[0041]FIG. 4 represents exemplary logic for recommending a subsequent imaging session based upon information contained in the EMR. It will be noted that the recommendation of the subsequent imaging session may include recommendation of particular modalities as well as particular protocols within these modalities that may be helpful in rendering high-quality medical care.
[0042]The logic of FIG. 4, in this particular example, begins with step 94 where the EMR is analyzed for various candidate diagnoses. In this particular example, a subsequent imaging session is recommended to refine potential diagnoses and to focus on either eliminating some of the candidate diagnoses or increasing a level of certainty of one or a few of the candidates. In a presently contemplated embodiment, the logic of FIG. 4 implements an exemplary algorithm used to determine the acquisition or reconstruction or display parameters or a combination of these that may enhance the distinguishability between candidate diagnoses. An exemplary algorithm of this type may be considered a "minimum entropy" algorithm. Other criteria for holistic optimization of acquisition, reconstruction and display parameters may be contemplated, although only the minimum entropy approach is described in detail here. The approach is particularly suitable to various computer assisted diagnosis or processing tools that may be integrated into the EMR or used in conjunction with the EMR and that may have rendered several potential diagnoses for a patient condition.
[0043]As a result of step 94, for the present example it may be assumed that the EMR contains a list of potential remaining diagnoses, which the caregiver would like to distinguish or refine. By way of example only, such diagnoses relating to a symptom of chest pain may indicate several possible clinical conditions including pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and so forth. A CT exam might be prescribed to distinguish which of these is the most likely diagnosis. As indicated at step 96, this process may include likelihood rating of each candidate diagnosis, such as based upon output of a computer assisted diagnosis or processing algorithm, or by inputs by a physician, radiologists or other specialists.
[0044]As indicated at step 98, the algorithm may then evaluate, given the information available in the EMR, which modality and/or imaging technique would provide the best differentiation between remaining diagnoses. For example, a CT-based acquisition technique might be good in theory in distinguishing between remaining diagnoses, but a previous X-ray acquisition might have already supplied the vast majority of the diagnostic value available from such modalities. Accordingly, a more appropriate next step might be to forego CT imaging and perform magnetic resonance imaging or imaging via a functional modality such as PET/CT or SPECT.
[0045]Moreover, the algorithm may create a matrix of possible diagnoses correlated with possible next diagnostic steps in terms imaging, image processing, reconstruction, analysis, display or visualization. Each element in the matrix could represent a remaining likely certainty or uncertainty of a diagnosis for a particular disease mechanism (i.e., definitely ruled in or definitely ruled out being of zero uncertainty). An information quality or entropy metric (e.g., the sum of the natural logarithm of the uncertainties) could be taken for the likely state after each modality or imaging technique. The modality or technique with the lowest entropy score (i.e., providing the lowest uncertainty or the greatest information) would receive the greatest value and would be selected for the recommendation.
