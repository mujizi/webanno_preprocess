[0018] Among the drawbacks concerning the extraction step described above, this method can eliminate only one part of the fragments, leaving a remaining amount of fragments still stuck to the container. This is due, mainly, to the fact that they adhere to the inner surfaces of the tube by means of electrostatic forces that an air jet cannot overcome. Such forces are due to presence of electric charges on the fragments and/or particles at the end of the tube manufacturing steps and particularly after the cutting process.
[0019] Various systems are known for reducing or eliminating the electrostatic forces that may cause fragments to adhere to the inner surfaces of containers, by using ionized air.
[0020] US2007240784A1 and US2003115710A1 describe a method adapted to remove particles from bottles of plastics that are arranged upside-down. A jet of ionized air enters the bottles, and then a jet of normal air follows to remove the particles. This method is not suitable for glass tubes, which are long and cannot proceed vertically.
[0021] U.S. Pat. No. 3,071,497A describes a method adapted to remove particles from glass containers like ampoules vials, syringes, cartridges, used for containing drugs and pharmaceutical products. The method provides blowing externally a jet of ionized air and then applying a mechanical vibration to the container that is oriented with its mouth towards below, so that the particles may fall by gravity. Also in this case the method is not adapted for long glass tubes, like those object of the present application. Also in case of short glass tubes, or container made by glass tubes, the method of U.S. Pat. No. 3,071,497A cannot be used, owing to the very strict requirements concerning fragments or particles.
[0022] It is a general object of the present invention to provide a method for removal of fragments and/or particles from glass tubes or containers obtained from glass tubes, on automatic production lines, which overcomes the above described problems.
