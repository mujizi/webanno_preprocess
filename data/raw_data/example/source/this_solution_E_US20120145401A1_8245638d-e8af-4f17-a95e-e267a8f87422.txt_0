Inhibition of Silica Precipitation in the Presence of Tannic Acid and Al.sup.3+
[0059] A solution of Al.sup.3+ was prepared by dissolving aluminum acetate in 100 mL of distilled water to form a 0.080 M solution having a pH of 4.96. To this solution were added incremental volumes of a 0.017 M tannic acid solution having a pH of 2.25. The pH was monitored while adding the tannic acid solution until a pH of 2.4 was reached. Approximately 65 mL of the tannic acid solution was added. To the Al.sup.3+/tannic acid solution was added 50 mL of the silicic acid stock solution, which further reduced the pH to 0.8. The pH was gradually raised with a strong base as described in Examples 1 and 2. Shortly after reaching a pH of 1, a colloid formed that slowly redissolved with stirring. Further addition of base was continued until a pH of 3 was reached, at which point redissolution of the colloidal solid failed to occur. Unlike Example 2, the addition of acid failed to redissolve the precipitate. Thus, this example shows that lower saturation concentrations of dissolved silicon occur in the presence of aluminum ions.
