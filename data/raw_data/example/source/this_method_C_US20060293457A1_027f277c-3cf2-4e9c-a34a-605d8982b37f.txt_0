[0045] Examples of organic peroxides that may be used are di-tert-butyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, t-butylcumyl peroxide, alpha-alpha-bis(tert-butylperoxy)diisopropyl benzene, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexane, 1,1-di(t-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethyl cyclohexane, n-butyl-4,4-bis(tert-butylperoxy)valerate, benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)hexene-3, and in general, diaryl peroxides, ketone peroxides, peroxydicarbonates, peroxyesters, dialkyl peroxides, hydroperoxides, peroxyketals and combinations thereof. Azo initiators such as Luazo.RTM. AP (available from ATO Chemical) may also be used as free radical initiators.
[0046] In addition to the peroxide, other cure adjuvants or coagents can be used. Examples are triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, triallyl phosphate, sulfur, N-phenyl bis-maleamide, zinc diacrylate, zinc dimethacrylate, divinyl benzene, 1,2 polybutadiene, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, tetramethylene glycol diacrylate, trifunctional acrylic ester, dipentaerythritolpentacrylate, polyfunctional acrylate, polyfunctional methacrylates, acrylate and methacrylate metal salts, and oximer, e.g. quinone dioxime.
[0047] Hydrosilylation has also been disclosed as a crosslinking method for thermoplastic vulcanizates and is suitable in the process of the invention. In this method a silicon hydride having at least two SiH groups in the molecule is reacted with the carbon-carbon multiple bonds of the unsaturated (i.e. containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond) rubber component of the thermoplastic elastomer, in the presence of the thermoplastic resin and a hydrosilylation catalyst. Silicon hydride compounds useful in the process of the invention include methylhydrogen polysiloxanes, methylhydrogen dimethyl-siloxane copolymers, alkyl methyl polysiloxanes, bis(dimethylsilyl)alkanes and bis(dimethylsilyl)benzene. See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,672,660, and 6,150,464, for further description, both are incorporated by reference.
[0048] Platinum-containing catalysts which are useful with the silicon hydride compounds for improved cure in the process of the invention are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,578,497; U.S. Pat. No. 3,220,972; and U.S. Pat. No. 2,823,218, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. These catalysts include chloroplatinic acid, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate, complexes of chloroplatinic acid with sym-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane, dichloro-bis(triphenylphosphine)platinum (II), cis-dichloro-bis(acetonitrile)platinum (II), dicarbonyldichloroplatinum (II), platinum chloride and platinum oxide. Zero valent platinum metal complexes such as Karstedt's catalyst are particularly preferred, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,775,452; U.S. Pat. No. 3,814,730; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,288,345 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0049] Any phenolic curative which fully cures EPDM rubber is suitable in the practice of the invention. The use of conventional phenolic resin curatives for crosslinking EPDM in a thermoplastic elastomer is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,311,628, which is incorporated by reference for its teachings thereon. See also, the dibenzyl ether modified phenolic resins of U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,425, also incorporated by reference for its teachings. For further details of phenolic curative systems see "Vulcanization and Vulcanizing Agents," W. Hoffman, Palmerton Publishing Company. Suitable phenolic curing resins and brominated phenolic curing resins are commercially available under the trade names SP-1045, HRJ14247A, CRJ-352, SP-1055 and SP-1056 from Schenectady Chemicals, Inc. Similar functionally equivalent phenolic curing resins may be obtained from other suppliers. In one embodiment, the phenolic curative is added into the first feeding throat along with any coagent, polymer feed components, and optionally, with all, or a portion, of filler, processing oil and the like. In another embodiment, the coagents are added at the feed throat and the phenolic resin is added downstream from the feed throat but preferably not after 46% of the length of the multi-screw extruder.
