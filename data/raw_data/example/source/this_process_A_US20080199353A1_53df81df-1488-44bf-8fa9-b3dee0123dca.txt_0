[0035]In another illustrative example, a syringe may be used both as an input containing a fluid (e.g., diluent or known drug compound) to be admixed in a compounding process, and as an output containing a prepared dose suitable for delivery to a patient. Such a syringe may be needed to fulfill a special reconstitution order programmed into the APAS cell 100 via the input/output capabilities of the monitor 102, for example. In another example, the order may be a stat order, which may be received from a hospital interface. In this example, the operator performs in situ loading by placing the syringes to be used for both reconstitution and dosing in pockets on a rack already located on the carousel 210. The operator enters the reconstitution order into the APAS cell 100. The robotic arm 218 picks the selected syringe from a pocket in the rack in the carousel 210 and moves it to the decapper/deneedler station 220, where the needle cap is removed from the syringe/needle combination, thereby exposing the needle. The syringe is then transferred by the robotic arm 218 to a needle-down syringe manipulator 234. At the station 234, diluent is drawn into the syringe from a diluent supply IV bag 236 previously placed there by the robotic arm 218. The diluent supply 236 may be contained in an IV bag which is hung on the needle-down syringe manipulator 234 by a clip (not shown). An air extraction process may be performed to prime the IV bag, if needed. The syringe then punctures the membrane of the diluent port 238 in a needle-down orientation. The syringe is actuated to remove, for example, a predetermined amount of the diluent from the IV bag. The needle-down syringe manipulator 234 then moves a reconstitution vial 250, placed there previously by the robotic arm 218, under the syringe. The diluent in the syringe is transferred to the vial for reconstitution with the vial contents. The robotic arm 218 then moves the vial to a mixer 248 for shaking according to a mixing profile. The robotic arm 218 then moves the vial to the needle-up syringe manipulator 222 where the appropriate amount of the reconstituted drug is drawn from the vial into an "output" syringe that was previously conveyed there by the robotic arm 218.
[0036]In another embodiment, the APAS cell 100 may receive a production order to prepare compounds that may involve IV bags as input inventory items or as outputs. In some examples, an IV bag may be selected as a diluent source for reconstitution in a drug order to be output into another medical container. In other examples, the selected IV bag may be used for output after preparation of the drug order is completed. Some IV bags may be placed on the carousels 210, 212 and used as an input that may be at least partially filled with a diluent that may be used to reconstitute drugs. The reconstituted drugs may be output in the form of charged syringes or IV bags. The operator loads racks of syringes and IV bags into the carousel 210 for use in the production order. During the production order, the robotic arm 218 picks an IV bag from a rack on the carousel 210 and moves it to the scale and bag ID station 226. At this station, the IV bag is identified by bar code or pattern matching and its weight is recorded. This may be done, for example, as an error check, and/or to positively identify the type and/or volume of diluent being used for reconstitution. If the IV bag is selected as a diluent source, then the bag may be weighed before use to confirm the presence of the diluent in the IV bag. If the IV bag is selected for output, it may be weighed multiple times, such as before, during, and/or after each fluid transfer step, for example. As a post-transfer verification step, the weight may be re-checked after fluid transfer operations have occurred to determine if the change in weight is within an expected range. Such checks may detect, for example, leaks, spills, overfills, or material input errors. In this example, the robotic arm 218 moves the IV bag to a port cleaner station 240 where a ultraviolet (UV) light or other sanitizing process may be used to substantially sterilize, disinfect or sanitize at least a portion of the IV bag port. The robotic arm 218 moves the IV bag to the needle-up syringe manipulator 222 where a pre-filled syringe has been loaded. The IV bag may be inverted so that the fill port is oriented downwardly for the fill process. The contents of the syringe may then be injected into the IV bag. The robotic arm 218 then conveys the IV bag to the scale station 226 where the IV bag is weighed to confirm the predetermined dose programmed into the APAS cell 100. The robotic arm 218 then moves the IV bag to a bag labeler tray station 242 where a label printed by the printer and labeling station 228 is applied to the IV bag. The robotic arm 218 may move the IV bag to the output scanner station 230, where the information on the ID label is read by the scanner to verify that the label is readable. One or more further verification checks may be performed. The IV bag is then taken by the robotic arm 218 and dropped into the IV bag discharge chute 244 where it is available to the pharmacy technician, for example, to be placed in inventory within the hospital pharmacy.
[0037]In another embodiment, a vial (or other medical item or container) may be prepared for reconstitution. During the performing of this process by the APAS cell 100, the vial may be identified at a vial ID station where, for example, a bar coded label on the vial may be read by a scanner and/or image hardware in combination with image processing software. The captured information may be processed to identify the contents of the vial and correlate it to what is expected. In some implementations, as an alternative to or in combination with bar code scanning, the APAS cell 100 may employ pattern matching on the vial using optical scanning techniques. Also, in the reconstitution process, vial mixers 248 may be used to mix the vial contents with the diluent before using it for dosing.
[0038]In some embodiments, the robotic manipulator may include apparatus for reading machine readable indicia in the APAS, including the compounding chamber and/or the storage chamber. For example, the manipulator may include a fiber optic camera for taking images that can be processed to compare to stored image information (e.g., bitmaps). In other examples, the reading apparatus may include optical scanning (e.g., bar code) or RFID (radio frequency identification). Some embodiments may transmit image information wirelessly (e.g., using infrared or RF (radio frequency) transmissions) to a receiver coupled to the APAS. Such a receiver may be located inside or outside the chamber with the robotic manipulator. Such a reader may be used to read machine readable indicia at various locations in and around the compounding chamber, including through windows and on portions of the storage carousels that are exposed to the compounding chamber.
[0039]In the embodiments described here, a UV port sanitization system (PSS) is used in the sanitization of vial and bag ports in an IV admixture compounding application. Variants of the system described here may also include sanitization of syringe bodies. The system may be part of an APAS cell or used as a stand alone device. Examples of an APAS system are described in further detail, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/316,795, entitled "Automated Pharmacy Admixture System," and filed on Dec. 22, 2005, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/389,995, entitled "Automated Pharmacy Admixture System," and filed on Mar. 27, 2006, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
