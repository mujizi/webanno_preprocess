[0159] The solution mining method may be carried out in a batch mode, which may be termed a `cut-and-soak` mining method. The solvent injection is initiated to fill up the unlined borehole portion and/or the undercut cavity and then stopped, so that the non-moving solvent dissolves the desired solute further cutting the exposed free face of the ore until the solvent gets saturated with desired solute, at which point the resulting liquor is removed from a down-dip location of the ore bed to the surface. Once the undercut cavity is drained, solvent is injected again and the batch process (filling cavity, stopping solvent flow, dissolution, collection) is repeated. The injection point may need to be moved to another ore location such as a location downward or upward from the previously-used injection point depending on whether the undercut formation is advancing or retreating. In this manner, this `cut-and-soak` mining method may be operated in cascade in several adjacent fresh ore regions over time. The operation in cascade may be initiated up-dip and the injection point is moved down-dip over time. The solvent injection may be terminated when the down-dip edge of the undercut reaches the down-dip edge of the ore bed.
[0160] With respect to any or all embodiments of the present invention, a periodic (or intermittent or continuous) injection of insoluble materials (such as tailings) concurrently with the solvent may be carried out. The injection of insoluble materials may comprise: periodically mixing a specified amount of insoluble material with the solvent and injecting the combined mixture directly into the unlined borehole portion or a conduit concentrically positioned inside it; or injecting insolubles (e.g., tails or tailings) through a second conduit (other than the primary solvent conduit) which is inserted in each unlined borehole portion. Such injection of insoluble materials may form islands of insoluble material that would shift the solvent flow to fresh ore (e.g., virgin trona) and/or would form some support for the downward-moving roof. In this manner, a support system of insoluble material may be constructed to halt the roof movement to a desired point while flow channels created by dissolution of the solute in the ore region surrounding the insoluble material would allow for movement of the pregnant solution through this region of the ore. Deposits of insoluble materials (such as tailings) may also be employed to block certain flow pathways, especially those which may short-circuit passing over (or bypass) fresh ore, such as observed with the phenomenon of `channeling` described later.
[0161] It is to be understood that, either due to the nature of the roof rock or through the way in which this process will gradually allow the roof to sag and lay down without much fracturing, liquor contamination from roof material may not be a major issue. Should this be the case, Applicants believe that the system can be operated much more aggressively in terms of solvent flow rates, undercut retreating or advancing rates, and the volume of ore rubble in production.
[0162] It is believed that, due to the dynamic nature of the in situ solution mining of the present invention, the solution mining of a trona bed using the traveling undercut method will not be hindered by the so-called `bicarb blinding` effect, because there is a continual replenishment of fresh trona in the undercut for dissolution of sodium values and production of liquor.
[0163] For any or all embodiments of the present invention, some underground gas may be released when part of the overburden susceptible to gravitational loading and crushing cracks and falls into the undercut. This released underground gas may contain methane. Indeed, in the case of trona mining, even though the trona itself contains very little carbonaceous material and therefore liberates very little methane, a trona bed is generally underlain by a methane-bearing oil shale which liberates methane during mining. When such underground gas release occurs during undercut expansion, purges of the released gas may be performed periodically to remove the gas and relief pressure so as to prevent pressure buildup and/or to minimize safety concerns. It is recommended to stop solvent flow downhole during such gas purge. Purge of released gas may be effected by passage to the surface via the already-formed boreholes used for solvent injection, preferably through an injection borehole positioned up-dip (since gas moves upwards). Alternatively, the purge of released gas may be effected by one or more secondary purge wells. The downhole section of the one or more secondary purge wells is preferably in fluid communication with the upper part of the undercut, thus allowing fluid communication with the ore being mined and the purge well. To achieve such communication, the purge well downhole section may be drilled though the shale layer and the ore roof.
