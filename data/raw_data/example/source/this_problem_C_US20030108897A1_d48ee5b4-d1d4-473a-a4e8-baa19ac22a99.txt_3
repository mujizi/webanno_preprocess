[0296] The aim of merging pSF part of the algorithm is the reduction of the number of pSFs to the minimal number of longer subfragments with the correct sequence. All k-tuple subfragments that do not have an overlap on either end, of the length of longer than k-a on one, and longer than k-b on the other end, are eliminated to enable the maximal number of connections. In this way, the majority of false positive k-tuples are discarded. The rule for connection is: two subfragments can be unambiguously connected if, and only if the overlapping sequence of the relevant end or start of two subfragments is not present on the start and/or end of any other subfragment. The exception is a subfragment with the identical beginning and end. In that case connection is permitted, provided that there is another subfragment with the same end present in the file. The main problem here is of precise definition of overlapping sequence. The presence of at least two specific false negative k-tuples on the points of repetition of k-1 or k-2 sequences, as well as combining of the false positive and false negative k-tuples may destroy or "mask" some overlapping sequences and can produce an unambiguous, but wrong connection of pSFs. To prevent this, completeness must be sacrificed on account of exactness: the connection is not permitted on the end-sequences shorter than k-2, and in the presence of an extra overlapping sequence longer than k-4. The overlapping sequences are defined from the end of the pSFs, or omitting one, or few last bases.
[0297] In the very rare situations, with the presence of a certain number of some specific false positive and false negative k-tuples, some subfragments with the wrong end can survive, some false positive k-tuples (as minimal subfragments) can remain, or the erroneous connection can take place. These cases are detected and solved in the subfragments ordering process, and in the additional control steps along with the handling of uncut, misconnected subfragments.
[0298] The process of ordering of subfragments is similar to the process of their generation. If one considers subfragments as longer k-tuples, ordering is performed by their unambiguous connection via overlapping ends. The informational basis for unambiguous connection is the division of subfragments generated in fragments of the basic library into groups representing segments of those fragments. The method is analogous to the biochemical solution of this problem based on hybridization with longer oligonucleotides with relevant connecting sequence. The connecting sequences are generated as subfragments using the k-tuple sets of the appropriate segments of basic library fragments. Relevant segments are defined by the fragments of the ordering library that overlap with the respective fragments of the basic library. The shortest segments are informative fragments of the ordering library. The longer ones are several neighboring informative fragments or total overlapping portions of fragments corresponding of the ordering and basic libraries. In order to decrease the number of separate samples, fragments of the ordering library are randomly pooled, and the unique k-tuple content is determined.
[0299] By using the large number of fragments in the ordering library very short segments are generated, thus reducing the chance of the multiple appearance of the k-1 sequences which are the reasons for generation of the subfragments. Furthermore, longer segments, consisting of the various regions of the given fragment of the basic library, do not contain some of the repeated k-1 sequences. In every segment a connecting sequence (a connecting subfragment) is generated for a certain pair of the subfragments from the given fragment. The process of ordering consists of three steps: (1) generation of the k-tuple contents of each segment; (2) generation of subfragments in each segment; and (3) connection of the subfragments of the segments. Primary segments are defined as significant intersections and differences of k-tuple contents of a given fragment of the basic library with the k-tuple contents of the pools of the ordering library. Secondary (shorter) segments are defined as intersections and differences of the k-tuple contents of the primary segments.
[0300] There is a problem of accumulating both false positive and negative k-tuples in both the differences and intersections. The false negative k-tuples from starting sequences accumulate in the intersections (overlapping parts), as well as false positive k-tuples occurring randomly in both sequences, but not in the relevant overlapping region. On the other hand, the majority of false positives from either of the starting sequences is not taken up into intersections. This is an example of the reduction of experimental errors from individual fragments by using information from fragments overlapping with them. The false k-tuples accumulate in the differences for another reason. The set of false negatives from the original sequences are enlarged for false positives from intersections and the set of false positives for those k-tuples which are not included in the intersection by error, i.e. are false negative in the intersection. If the starting sequences contain 10% false negative data, the primary and secondary intersections will contain 19% and 28% false negative k-tuples, respectively. On the other hand, a mathematical expectation of 77 false positives may be predicted if the basic fragment and the pools have lengths of 500 bp and 10,000 bp, respectively. However, there is a possibility of recovering most of the "lost" k-tuples and of eliminating most of the false positive k-tuples.
