[0004]Electronic documents are a cornerstone of digital computing. These documents cover a wide variety of types and purposes--from the spreadsheets and word processing documents used in daily business activities to digital music and video files used for leisure. Organizations often use a variety of electronic documents to calculate, present, and store information that is vital for daily business functions. Advances in personal electronics even allow electronic documents to be created and/or received by an abundance of devices, such as mobile phones and personal data assistants (PDAs).
[0005]Since electronic documents contain such a vast amount of important information, security is a significant concern. In order to address this issue, many different techniques have been developed to protect electronic documents. Using one technique, an electronic document can be encrypted via an encryption algorithm. Although effective for preventing unauthorized viewing by those without the proper decrypting algorithm, this method is unable to provide fine-grained permission control over an electronic document. Additionally, encryption is an "all or nothing" form of protection; either all data sections of the document are encrypted or none. The protection of the document ceases once it is decrypted. Further, a decrypted document can be copied and sent to others. Therefore, the original owner loses control of the electronic document once it has been deployed and decrypted.
[0006]Another technique often used for protecting documents utilizes server-based protections assigned by a file server. The most common practice of this technique is the use of file permissions available through the server's operating system. However, once the document is removed from the server and/or server-controlled environment and is deployed to a remote device, as in an email attachment, for example, the protection afforded by the server's permissions ceases. The document is again vulnerable to unauthorized access and use.
[0007]Online collaborative systems attempt to address the shortcomings of encryption and server permissions by creating a self-contained working environment for electronic documents. Like server protection, these systems are good at protecting documents only if the documents remain within the self-contained environment. Since access to the documents is controlled by the system, users are unable to access documents when not connected to the system, typically requiring some form of network access. Users are further inconvenienced by being forced to use the tools or applications provided by the system.
