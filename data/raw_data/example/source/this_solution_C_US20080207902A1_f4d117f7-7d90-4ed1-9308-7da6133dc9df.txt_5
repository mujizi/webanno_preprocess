4-acetyloxymethyl-3-ethoxycarbonyl-2-diethoxymethyl-4-methoxy-pyrazolo[1,5--a]pyridine
[0246]The compound of Example 18 (2.10 g) was dissolved in pyridine (20 mL). To this solution, acetic anhydride (1.12 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 6 hours at room temperature. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated to afford the title compound as a colorless oil (2.01 g).
