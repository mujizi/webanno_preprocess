[0080] After implementing the Fluoroscopy, the user may start the injector by pressing the "Start injector" button 298 which will essentially begin the injection of the contrast agent. If the "Acquisition Delay" 292 had a value greater than zero, the viewer would start a timer and would auto-scan when it reaches the same value displayed in the "Acquisition Delay" text field 292 if "Auto Trigger" 294 was selected. The user may watch the image 284 in the viewer as well as the graph 290 in order to detect the arrival of the contrast. Once the contrast is detected, it is time to begin the scan. The user may give any necessary instructions to the patient (i.e. hold breath) and press the "Scan" button 296, which will cause the sequence of arterial and venous image acquisitions to occur as prescribed in the "Summary" step. As these images are being acquired, they will be automatically displayed in the viewer. The user may scroll, pan/zoom, and window level these images.
[0081] A second way in which the user may acquire arterial and venous images is through the use of a timing bolus. To do this, the user must first prescribe the location for the fluoro image. The user may then start the fluoro acquisition by pressing the "Start Fluoro" button 282. As the fluoro acquisition is occurring in real-time, the user may prepare themselves and the patient and then press the "Timing Bolus" button 300. This will cause a few things to occur. First, button 300 will change to read "Mark Time" and still be active. Second, the image will display a timer 302 that is incrementing in seconds from the time the "Timing Bolus" button 300 is pressed and will not stop until the "Mark Time" button 300 is pressed. The final change from pressing the "Timing Bolus" button 300 is that the injector will inject a small amount of bolus into the patient, which the user will use to time the arrival of contrast into the fluoro image.
[0082] After the "Timing Bolus" button 300 is pressed, the user will watch the image 284, and possibly the graph 290, for the contrast to arrive. When the contrast is detected, the user presses the "Mark Time" button 300. This action will cause timer 302 on the image to stop incrementing. Further, a "Time to Start" text field (not shown) will become active with the same value as the timer on the image. Next, the user may decide to change the value of the "Time to Start" text field by simply highlighting the field and entering in a new value, or leave it as is. (Note: Throughout this process, the fluoro acquisition continues to occur.) Now the user may acquire the arterial and venous run images.
[0083] When "Start Injector" button 298 is pressed, the full amount of contrast agent is injected into the patient and the value in the text field and the timer on the image will begin counting down therefore functioning as a visual queue/reminder to the user. If the auto trigger 294 is selected, the value in the text field and on the image reaches zero and scanner automatically begins acquiring the arterial and venous images. The user may manually press the "Go 3D" button 296 before the timer in the viewer reaches the value displayed in the "Time to Start" text field, but not after. If the auto trigger is not selected, the value in the text field and on the image only serves as a "guide" to the user that they should manually select the "Go 3D" button 296 when it reaches a value of zero. However, when the value does equal the "Time to Start" text field, nothing happens. Therefore, it is up to the user in this case to initiate the scan. They may do it before, after, or when the times equal. When the scan is initiated, a scanning timing bar 304 is displayed as well as a scan time timer 306.
[0084] After the user has completed the acquisition of the arterial and venous images the user may save this particular instance of the PV application as a protocol that may be implemented at a later date without reentering each parameter. This allows for buildup of a protocol database that may be accessed in the future. To save the protocol, the user selects the "Save Rx as Protocol" button 176 inside the Rx Manager 170 on left side of the GUI.
