[0093] The nano concave-convex structure described above is not limited to the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, and it can be formed wholly or partly on one or all sides of the cured material of the resin composition of the present invention. Also, in order to effectively develop the water-repellent performance, it is preferable that the tip of the projection of the convex portion is thin, and it is preferable the area occupied by the cured material on the contact surface of the water drop with the nano concave-convex structure body is as small as possible.
<Production Method>
[0094] Examples of the method for producing a nano concave-convex structure body include, for example, (1) a method which contains providing the resin composition between a stamper and a substrate which have an inversion structure of a nano concave-convex structure, curing the resin composition by irradiation of an activation energy ray to transfer the concave-convex structure of the stamper, and thereafter detaching the stamper, and (2) a method which contains detaching the stamper after transferring the concave-convex structure of the stamper, and thereafter curing the resin composition by irradiation of an activation energy ray. Among these, from the viewpoint of the transcription property of the nano concave-convex structure and the flexibility of the surface composition, method (1) is preferably preferable. This method is particularly suitable in the case of using a belt or roll stamper by which the continuous production can be conducted, and is an excellent method in productivity.
(Substrate)
[0095] The substrate is preferably a transparent substrate, namely a molded body in which a light is transmitted. Examples of the material composing the transparent substrate include, for example, synthetic polymers such as methyl methacrylate (co)polymers, polycarbonates, styrene (co)polymers, and methyl methacrylate-styrene copolymer, semisynthetic polymers such as cellulose diacetates, cellulose triacetates, and cellulose acetate butyrate, polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalates and polylactic acids, polyamides, polyimides, polyethersulfones, polysulfones, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polymethylpentenes, polyvinyl chlorides, polyvinyl acetals, polyether ketones, polyurethanes, the complexes of these polymers (complexes of a polymethyl methacrylate and a polylactic acid, complexes of polymethyl methacrylate and polyvinyl chloride and the like), and glasses.
