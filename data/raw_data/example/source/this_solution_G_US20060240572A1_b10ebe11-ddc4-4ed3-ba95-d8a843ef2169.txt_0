[0103] An exemplary assay for serotonin according to the present invention is now described. Nanoscale paramagnetic particles may be produced using an accepted method of coprecipitation of Fe.sup.3+ and Fe.sup.2+ in 6N NaOH at 85.degree. C. Equal molar equivalents of ferrous ammonium sulfate and ferric ammonium sulfate are added to 400 ml of deionized H.sub.2O. The solution is then brought to between 85-90.degree. C. and 850 ml of 6N NaOH is added over 90 minutes. The resulting precipitated particles are separated and washed using a centrifuge. Each aliquot of the particle solution is centrifuged at approximately 250 G for ten minutes. The resulting supernatant is removed and the pellet is resuspended in Millipore water. This procedure is repeated until the resulting solution is approximately pH 7.
[0104] The neutral paramagnetic particles are then coated by a reduction of silver nitrate on to the paramagnetic surface using a citrate reduction analogous to a Lee and Meisel procedure. (Lee, P. C.; Meisel, D., Adsorption and surface-enhanced Raman of dyes on silver and gold sols. Journal of Physcial Chemistry 1982, 86, (17), 3391-5.) Ninety (90) mg of silver nitrate is added to 500 mL of the neutral paramagnetic particle solution in a 1000 mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a large stir bar. The solution is brought to a boil and 10 mL of 1% sodium citrate is added. The solution is allowed to boil for 1 hr. The paramagnetic particles act as aggregation sites for the reduction of the silver nitrate. After 1 hr of boiling the black solution of PP becomes reddish-brown indicating a change in the optical properties of the solution. Once cool, the volume is brought back to 500 ml.
[0105] The neurotransmitter specific coating is prepared by diazotizing 1.5 mg of a stock 5.0.times.10.sup.-3 M solution of the 0507 tether (Corcoran Research Group, University of Wyoming) (as the stable amine) in a 1-dram screw top vial. Nine hundred (900) .mu.L of absolute ethanol purchased from Aldrich and 100 .mu.L of p-toluene sulfonic acid solution (PTSA, 100 mg/mL in absolute ethanol) is added to the 1.5 mg of the 0507 tether. This solution is stirred with a micro-stir bar in an ice bath in a refrigerator at 0.degree. C. for 30 minutes. To form a diazonium, 2 .mu.L of butyl nitrite is added to the reaction mixture and stirred for an additional 30 minutes. If stored below 0.degree. C., this stock solution of diazotized tether can last for 2-3 days. A yellow or rose color indicates the solution is no longer active. The 0507 tether solution is further diluted to 1.0.times.10.sup.-4 M with Millipore water for use in experiments. The addition of water also reduces the appearance of ethanol peaks in the Raman spectra. The characteristic peaks of the 0507 tether are identified in the Raman spectrum from a blank consisting of 100 .mu.L of the 0507 tether and 900 .mu.L of silver-coated, paramagnetic nanoparticle colloid.
[0106] The next step is to determine the reactivity of serotonin with the 0507 tether and determine a detection limit. A 1.0.times.10.sup.-3 M stock solution of serotonin is prepared with 2.1 mg of serotonin (Aldrich) diluted with 10 mL of 1.0 M Dulbecco's phosphate buffer (Aldrich). Subsequent dilutions ranging in concentration from 1.0.times.10.sup.-4 M to 1.0.times.10.sup.-10 M are made in 1-dram vials and diluted with the Dulbecco's buffer. A 0.1 M solution of sodium borohydride is used to reduce the excess diazonium back to the amine. This form cannot react with itself to form an interfering dye. The solution of sodium borohydride is made by dissolving 3.7 mg of sodium borohydride in 1 mL of 0.5 M sodium hydroxide solution. The borohydride is important as the unreacted 0507 tether can constitute an interference in the assays. By allowing the 0507 tether to react with the serotonin and subsequently adding the borohydride, the excess diazonium is reduced back to the unreactive amine form.
[0107] Five hundred (500) .mu.L of each of the 1.0.times.10.sup.-4 M 0507 tether solution and the serotonin solution, of the different concentrations, are added together in 1-dram vial. An amount of sodium borohydride equal to 1% of the total volume of the solution is then added (10 .mu.L). This is the reaction mixture. In this solution, a reaction between the 0507 tether and analyte occurs and the excess diazonium is converted back to the unreactive amine form. Ten 100 .mu.L samples are created by a serial dilution of this solution in order to provide a concentration range one order of magnitude lower than the original concentration of reaction mixture. To each 100 .mu.L sample, 300 .mu.L of the colloid is added and placed on a vortex for three seconds. This vial is placed into a Raman spectrometer (e.g., a Delta Nu Advantage 200A Raman instrument). A Raman spectrum indicative of the seratonin is acquired within an average of 5-1 second acquisitions.
