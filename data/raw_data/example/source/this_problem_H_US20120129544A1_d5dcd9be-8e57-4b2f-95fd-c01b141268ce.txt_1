[0076] Step 708 by taking another GPS reading. As long as the heavy traffic condition is maintained, the altered control criteria will be used to determine how and when the permitted uses of the mobile device 102 will change. Once the traffic condition clears (e.g., as indicated by the traffic control information or some of the speed variation measures described above), the processor will revert the control criteria to their nominal settings (i.e., the safe speed threshold will be decreased to its previous value of 10 miles per hour). Failure to receive an ACM for a predetermined period of time may also indicate a maintained high speed or low traffic condition, and thus cause the control criteria to revert to their nominal "normal traffic" values.
[0077] In some implementations, information about the motion patterns of the mobile device 102 are stored in a database (e.g., the access database 222) and are used to "learn" habitual traveled conditions of the mobile device 102. Using known pattern recognition techniques, such implementations account for rush hour traffic experienced on a repeated basis, such as a commute to work or to school. For example, if the user of the mobile device 102 travels in New York City on 5th Avenue, Monday through Friday at 7:00 A.M., the processor stores identified heavy traffic conditions as discussed above in the database and utilizes that information to alter the control criteria to include a heavy traffic safe speed threshold in the MAP 123 during that time period. In this way, one of the criteria now stored as part of the MAP 123 would include an automatic alteration of the control criteria to the heavy traffic settings at a predetermined time period during predetermined days of the week, when the processor identifies that the mobile device 102 is within a radius of a predetermined location.
[0078] Many useful techniques for controlling mobile device operation were described above and illustrated with reference to FIGS. 1-7. Some of these techniques involve the use of a positioning system, such as GPS, to estimate the position of the mobile device. This position estimate can be used for a number of different control techniques, such as calculating the speed at which the mobile device is traveling. However, as noted above, continuously invoking a positioning system can quickly deplete the energy, processing, storage and bandwidth resources of the mobile device. Existing technologies fail to adequately address the challenges of mitigating GPS power consumption in mobile device control applications. Described below, and illustrated with reference to FIGS. 8-15, are systems and techniques that address this problem by selectively invoking a positioning system for use in mobile device control applications. In particular, these techniques include using a number of different non-position-based sensing modalities (e.g., acceleration, bearing and wireless network signals), both independently and in combination, to reduce the frequency with which an energy-expensive positioning system is invoked.
[0079] FIG. 8 is a flow chart of a method of selectively invoking a positioning system using multiple non-position-based sensors. Such methods and systems are also discussed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/950,605, filed Nov. 19, 2010, incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. The method of FIG. 8 is described with reference to first and second non-position-based sensors, but the method is naturally and usefully applied to embodiments in which only one non-position-based sensor is present, or three or more non-position-based sensors are present. Examples of specific non-position-based sensors, and associated mobile device motion techniques, are discussed below with reference to FIGS. 9-15.
[0080] At Step 802, the processor receives a first signal from a first non-position-based sensor. Such a signal may be, for example, an accelerometer signal, an electromagnetic compass signal, a wireless network environment signal, an anemometer signal, or a vibration detector signal. At Step 804, the processor receives a second signal from a second non-position-based sensor (which may take the form of any of the non-position-based sensors described herein). In some embodiments, the first and second non-position-based sensors are the same types of sensor.
