[1S-[1.alpha.,2.beta.,3.beta.,4.alpha.(1S*,2R*)]]-4-[7-[[2-(4-Methoxyphenyl)cyclopropyl]amino]-5-(propylthio)-3H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-3-yl]cyclopentane-1,2,3-triol
a) [1R-(trans)]-2-(4-Methoxyphenyl)cyclopropane carboxylic acid
To a solution of dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium (II) dimer (250 mg) and 2,6-bis[(4S)isopropyl-2-oxazolin-2-yl]pyridine (240 mg) in dichloromethane (150 ml) at room temperature was added 4-vinylanisole (25 g). To this solution was added ethyl diazoacetate (5.0 g) over 6 hr. The solution was maintained at room temperature for 18 hours then diluted with i-hexane (200 ml) and passed through a plug of silica (50 g) with a further 250 ml of 1:1 i-hexane/dichloromethane. The filtrate was concentrated and the residue dissolved in methanol (100 ml) and LiOH (4 g) in water (10 ml) added, the mixture was then refluxed for 4h. The resulting solution was concentrated to give a colourless solid which was washed with 1:1 ether/i-hexane (100 ml). The solid was then triturated with 2N HCl and the precipitate collected to give the subtitle compound (5.06 g).
