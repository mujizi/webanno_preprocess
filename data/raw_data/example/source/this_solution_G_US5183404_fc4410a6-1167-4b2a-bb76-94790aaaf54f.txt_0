FIG. 9 illustrates the communications card and connector of FIG. 8 installed in a laptop computer. 68 pin socket 42 is installed over a corresponding plug in electrical communication with the circuit board of the computer. Although communications card 40 complies with the 5 mm PCMCIA size restrictions, the 10 mm integrated connector 56 does not. As a result, integrated connector 56 must either be placed outside of the computer housing or must displace memory cards in adjoining slots.
Operation of the communications card requires only the connection of an RJ-11 plug into RJ-11 enclosed socket 36 or an RJ-45 or 8 pin modular plug for use in LANs. Signals received from remote modems are filtered by the internal DAA and converted by communications card 40.
Although this solution to the RJ-11 LAN interface problem eliminates the need for carrying extraneous components and eliminates the incompatibility of those components, some problems unique to the integral physical/electrical connector are introduced.
For example, the extension of integral connector 56 beyond the housing of the computer exposes the connector to the possibility of breakage even when the connector is not in use. The protrusion beyond the normal dimensions of the computer also interferes with the fit of computer portfolios used in transporting many laptop computers.
It would, therefore, be an advancement in the art to provide a 5 mm PCMCIA-architecture communications card that is capable of direct connection with a miniature modular plug physical/electrical media connector.
