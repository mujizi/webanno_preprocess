[0086] During the gravity filter flush mode using a reverse flush, the water from the recirculation pipe is injected into the filter via the recirculation port to dislodge the lint and solids from the filter element pores. The recirculation pipe extends to the top of the tub, while the water level in the bowl is always below this. This creates a hydrostatic pressure differential between the water in the recirculation pipe and the water in the bowl. This pressure differential can be of the order of 500 mm of water. Thus, when the recirculation pump is turned off, the water in the recirculation pipe will flow back into the filter housing and will exit the housing via the intake port and or the outlet port of the filter. The flow rate of this reverse flow will depend on the pressure differential, and on the flow characteristics of the recirculation path, such as minimum diameters of the pipes. Preferably, the reverse flow rate is greater than the forward recirculation flow rate. The pressure differential will decrease as the level of water in the recirculation pipe drops, and this will decrease the reverse flow rate during the gravitational flush.
[0087] In one embodiment, the cross-section of at least part of the recirculation pipe can be increased to provide a reverse flow of greater duration. Preferably, the increased cross-section is at the upper part of the recirculation pipe. The reason for providing the increased duration flow is to ensure that the reverse flow is of a sufficient flow rate for a sufficient time to remove at least a substantial part of the lint and solids collected by the filter.
[0088] This gravity feed reverse flush will result in the dislodgement of much of the trapped lint and solids into the interior of the filter. Some of the dislodged lint and solids may also return to the base of the bowl via the bowl drain. However, we have found that this process can be repeated two or more times without substantially degrading the washing performance of the machine. The short period of the reverse flush and the limited volume of water used in the reverse flush help reduce the amount of lint and solids returned to the base of the bowl. The gravity reverse flush has the advantage that it maintains the filter in operating condition without blocking for a greater period of time between pulsed flushes.
[0089] A pulsed flush is implemented by operating the drain pump to draw the water through the filter and discharge some of the water to the system outlet. The pulsed flush can occur one or more times during a washing cycle. To conserve water, it is desirable to minimize the amount of water discharged from the system during the pulsed flush. However, because of the presence of the one way valve, it is not necessary to completely drain the recirculation pipe, because the one way valve prevents the lint drawn off from re-entering the filter. The combination of one or more gravity reverse flushes with each one of one or more pulsed flushes during the wash cycle reduce the amount of water discharged, while maintaining the filter in an unclogged state.
[0090] FIG. 4 is a representation of a filter arrangement showing a one way valve 4.040 at the discharge end of the filter housing. The one-way valve prevents water in the drain pipe (2.021) from re-entering the filter. Thus, the drain pipe will normally be full of water. The water in the drain pipe can create pressure which prevents the gravitational back flush water from exiting via the drain port of the filter housing during the gravitational back flush. However, when the drain pump is turned on, as described below, the one way valve will open due to the pressure drop caused by the drain pipe. The drain pump flow then draws the lint laden water from the filter to the drain.
