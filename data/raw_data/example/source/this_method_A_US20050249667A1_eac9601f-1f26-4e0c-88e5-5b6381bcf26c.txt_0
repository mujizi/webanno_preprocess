[0249] Published United States paent application 2002/0106705 also discloses that: "Pentafluorophenylsulfonamidobenzenes and related sulfhydryl and disulfide modifying agents (see, e.g., compound 1; 2-fluoro-1-methoxy-4-pentafluorophenylsulfonamidobenzene . . . prevent microtubule formation by selectively covalently modifying .beta.-tubulin. For example, compound 1 does not covalently modify all of the five known .beta.-tubulin isotypes. Instead, binding is restricted to those .beta.-tubulin isotypes that have a cysteine residue at amino acid position 239 in .beta.-tubulin. Such isotypes include .beta.1, .beta.2 and .beta.4-tubulin. The other two isotypes (.beta.3 and .beta.5) have a serine residue at this particular position (Shan et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci USA 96:5686-5691 (1999)). It is notable that no other cellular proteins are modified by compound 1."
[0250] Published United States paent application 2002/0106705 relates primarily to a " . . . . a .beta.-tubulin isotype modified at cysteine residue 239 . . . " Thus, at page 3 of this published patent application, in defining a "beta-tubulin modifying agent," it describes such agent as follows: "A ".beta.-tubulin modifying agent" refers to an agent that has the ability to specifically react with an amino acid residue of .beta.-tubulin, preferably a cysteine, more preferably the cysteine residue at position 239 of a .beta.-tubulin isotype such as .beta.1-.beta.2- or .beta.4-tubulin and antigenic fragments thereof comprising the residue, preferably cysteine 239. The .beta.-tubulin modifying agent of the invention can be, e.g., any sulfhydryl or disulfide modifying agent known to those of skill in the art that has the ability to react with the sulfur group on a cysteine residue, preferably cysteine residue 239 of a .beta.-tubulin isotype. Preferably, the .beta.-tubulin modifying agents are substituted benzene compounds, pentafluorobenzenesulfonamides, arylsulfonanilide phosphates, and derivatives, analogs, and substituted compounds thereof (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,880,151; PCT 97/02926; PCT 97/12720; PCT 98/16781; PCT 99/13759; and PCT 99/16032, herein incorporated by reference; see also Pierce Catalogue, 1999/2000, and Means, Chemical Modification of Proteins). In one embodiment, the agent is 2-fluoro-1-methoxy-4-pentafluo- rophenylsulfonamidobenzene (compound 1; FIG. 1C). Modification of a .beta.-tubulin isotype at an amino acid residue, e.g., cysteine 239, by an agent can be tested by treating a tubulin peptide, described herein, with the putative agent, followed by, e.g., elemental analysis for a halogen, e.g., fluorine, reverse phase HPLC, NMR, or sequencing and HPLC mass spectrometry. Optionally compound 1 described herein can be used as a positive control. Similarly, an .alpha.-tubulin modifying agent refers to an agent having the ability to specifically modify an amino acid residue of an .alpha.-tubulin."
[0251] U.S. Pat. No. 6,541,509, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this specification, discloses a "method for treating neoplasis using combination chemotherapy." claim 1 of this patent describes: "A method of treating neoplasia in a subject in need of treatment, comprising administering to the subject an amount of paclitaxel effective to treat the neoplasia, in combination with an amount of discodermolide effective to treat the neoplasia, wherein a synergistic antineoplastic effect results." At column 6 of this patent, the patentees discuss how to determine synergy between two drugs. They state that: One measure of synergy between two drugs is the combination index (CI) method of Chou and Talalay [37], which is based on the median-effect principle. This method calculates the degree of synergy, additivity, or antagonism between two drugs at various levels of cytotoxicity. Where the CI value is less than 1, there is synergy between the two drugs. Where the CI value is 1, there is an additive effect, but no synergistic effect. CI values greater than 1 indicate antagonism. The smaller the CI value, the greater the synergistic effect. Another measurement of synergy is the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) [48]. This fractional value is determined by expressing the IC50 of a drug acting in combination, as a function of the IC50 of the drug acting alone. For two interacting drugs, the sum of the FIC value for each drug represents the measure of synergistic interaction. Where the FIC is less than 1, there is synergy between the two drugs. An FIC value of 1 indicates an additive effect. The smaller the FIC value, the greater the synergistic interaction. In the method of the present invention, combination therapy using paclitaxel and discodermolide preferably results in an antineoplastic effect that is greater than additive, as determined by any of the measures of synergy known in the art." The cited Chou et al. reference is an entited "Quantitative analysis of dose effect relationships: the combined effect of multiple drugs or enzyme inhibitors," Adv. Enzyme Regul., 11:27-56 (1984). The cited "reference 48 is an article by Hall et al., "The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) as a measure of synergy," J. Antimicrob. Chemother., 11(5):427-433 (1983).
[0252] Claim 8 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,541,509 describes "A synergistic combination of antineoplastic agents, comprising an effective antimenoplastic amount of paclitaxel and an effective antineoplastic amount of discodermolide." As one embodiment of the instant invention, applicants claims: A synergistic combination of antineoplastic agents, comprising an effective antimenoplastic amount of paclitaxel and an effective antineoplastic amount of the preferred, magnetic anti-mitotic compound of this inventon. Thus, the process of such U.S. Pat. No. 6,541,509 may be adapted to use the magnetic compound of this invention instead of discodermolide.
[0253] As is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,541,509, "The present invention provides a method of treating neoplasia in a subject in need of treatment. As used herein, `neoplasia` refers to the uncontrolled and progressive multiplication of cells under conditions that would not elicit, or would cause cessation of, multiplication of normal cells. Neoplasia results in the formation of a `neoplasm`, which is defined herein to mean any new and abnormal growth, particularly a new growth of tissue, in which the growth is uncontrolled and progressive. Malignant neoplasms are distinguished from benign in that the former show a greater degree of anaplasia, or loss of differentiation and orientation of cells, and have the properties of invasion and metastasis. Thus, neoplasia includes `cancer`, which herein refers to a proliferation of cells having the unique trait of loss of normal controls, resulting in unregulated growth, lack of differentiation, local tissue invasion, and metastasis." As support for this statement, the patent cited a work by Beers and Berkow (eds.), The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 17.sup.th edition (Whitehouse Station, N.J.; Merck Research Laboratories, 1999, 973-974, 976, 986, and 991).
