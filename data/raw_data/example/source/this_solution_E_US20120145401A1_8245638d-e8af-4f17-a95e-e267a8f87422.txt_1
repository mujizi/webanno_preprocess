Inhibition of Silica Precipitation in the Presence of Tannic Acid, Al.sup.3+ and a Chelating Agent
[0060] A solution of Al.sup.3+ was prepared by dissolving 1.19 g aluminum acetate in 110 mL of 20% (w/v) HEDTA solution, which also contained 5-10% glycolic acid. This solution had a pH of approximately 4. To this solution was added 50 mL of a 0.017 M tannic acid solution, 100 mL of the silicic acid stock solution, and finally water to produce a final volume of 300 mL. The pH of the combined solution was approximately 2. No precipitation was noted. The solution was split into two equal parts and a strong base solution was added to each to provide final pH values of 3.55 and 4.0. Unlike Example 3, neither of these solutions formed a precipitate within 4 hours of monitoring. Thus, this example shows that addition of a chelating agent can effectively sequester aluminum and maintain higher solution concentrations of dissolved silicon over a broad pH range.
