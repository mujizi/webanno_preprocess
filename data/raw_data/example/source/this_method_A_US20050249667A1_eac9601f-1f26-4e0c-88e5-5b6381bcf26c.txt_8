[1231] Referring to FIG. 47A microtubule 6100 is inhibited from its depolymerization by contact with an energy wave 6110. FIG. 47B illustrates that wave 6110 is a frequency of energy calculated, using the methods described elsewhere in this disclosure, to be a canceling wave. Canceling, or destructive interference, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,754,353 (Non-interference zones generated by acoustic wave cancellation system) by summarizing U.S. Pat. No. 5,396,561 (Active Acoustic Attenuation and Spectral Shaping System) stating that "Popovich et al. disclose an active acoustic system to provide attenuation and spectral shaping of an acoustic wave. Techniques for active attenuation that involves canceling acoustic wave to destructively interfere with and cancel an input acoustic wave are disclosed. In an active acoustic attenuation system, the input acoustic wave is sensed with an error transducer, e.g., a microphone. The transducers then supplies the sensed error signals to a control model to generate a correctional signal. The correctional signal is provided to a canceling transducer such as a loudspeaker to cancel the input acoustic wave. The improvement of this system includes a phase lock loop locked to the input acoustic wave and then generates a desired signal in given phase relation with the input acoustic wave . . . This active acoustic attenuation and spectral shaping system is very useful for an acoustic system, which receives voice input and undesirable noises as background information. The adaptive filter can be applied to cancel the noises by producing destructive interference signals. The active acoustic attenuation system as disclosed would be useful for a public announcing (PA) system or an acoustic recording chamber to filtering and canceling the undesirable noises." The entire disclosures of said patents are incorporated by reference into this specification.
[1232] Referring again to FIGS. 47A and 47B, and the embodiment depicted therein, an interference wave 6110 cancels the wave 6040 generated during the depolymerization of the microtubule 6100 resulting in a wave form that has a frequency close to zero, or in another preferred embodiment, sufficiently different to the native form of the wave 6040 to inhibit depolymerization of the microtubule or the inhibition of the hydrolysis of GTP in the microtubule or both.
[1233] Canceling, or "frequency domain filtering" is well known to those of skill in the art and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,738,480 (Method and device for cancelling stereophonic echo with frequency domain filtering)" which states "Frequency domain stereophonic echo cancellers implement a method wherein first and second input signals (x1, x2) are applied to an echo generator system and an observation signal (z) is picked up at an output of said system, the input signals being digitally sampled and processed in successive blocks of 2N samples with frequency domain transformation according to a set of 2N frequencies. In accordance with this method, the processing of a block of 2N samples comprises the steps of: transforming the first input signal from the time domain to the frequency domain to obtain a vector X1 having 2N complex components relating to the set of 2N frequencies, including spectral components of the first input signal relating to a sub-set of the set of 2N frequencies; transforming the second input signal from the time domain to the frequency domain to obtain a vector X2 having 2N complex components relating to the set of 2N frequencies, including spectral components of the second input signal relating to said sub-set of frequencies; multiplying term by term the vector X1 by a vector H1 of 2N complex coefficients to produce first estimated spectral echo components relating to the frequencies of the sub-set; multiplying term by term the vector X2 by a vector H2 of 2N complex coefficients to produce second estimated spectral echo components relating to the frequencies of the sub-set; adding the first and second estimated spectral echo components relating to each frequency of the sub-set to obtain a spectral component belonging to a vector of 2N estimated spectral total echo components; transforming the vector of 2N estimated spectral total echo components from the frequency domain to the time domain to obtain an estimated total echo; subtracting the estimated total echo from the observation signal to produce an error signal; transforming the error signal from the time domain to the frequency domain to obtain a vector E of 2N spectral components of the error signal relating to the set of 2N frequencies; and updating the vectors H1 and H2 for the processing of the next block, on the basis of the vectors X1, X2 and E . . . In the known systems, said sub-set of frequencies represents the entire set of 2N frequencies. Usually (stereophonic FDAF algorithm), the updating of the vectors H1 and H2 for the processing of the next block takes account of the energy gradient of the error signal, estimated by .gradient.i=X*i XE for the vector Hi (i=1 or 2), where X denotes the term-by-term product of two vectors and (*) denotes complex conjugation . . . The gradient is generally normalised: .gradient.Ni=Bi X.gradient.i for i=1 or 2, where Bi is a vector of size 2N, whose term corresponding to a frequency f is the inverse of the spectral energy Pii (f) of the i-th input signal evaluated at the frequency f (in other words, Pii (f)=<Xi(f).Xi (f)*>is a current average of .vertline.Xi(f).vertline.2=Xi (f).Xi (f)*, where Xi (f) is the component of the vector Xi relating to the frequency f) . . . In addition, a constraint is often placed on the normalised gradient in order to retain only the linear convolution terms in the frequency calculation of the gradients: . . . gradient.Ci=C.gradient.Ni for i=1 or 2, where C denotes a constant constraint matrix."
[1234] U.S. Pat. No. 6,738,480 also discloses "The echo estimation filters are finally adapted by Hi(k+1)=Hi (k)+.mu. . . . gradient.Ci (k) for i=1 or 2, the index k numbering the successive analysis blocks. The coefficient .mu., lying between 0 and 1, is the adaptation step." The entire disclosure of said patent is incorporated by reference into this specification."
[1235] In another preferred embodiment, not shown, a microtubule is contacted with ultrasound energy such that GTP hydrolysis occurs, or is promoted when it is contacted with said frequency.
