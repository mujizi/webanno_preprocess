[0095] 2. Viral Pathogens
[0096] The methods of the invention are also useful for obtaining recombinant nucleic acids and polypeptides that have enhanced ability to induce an immune response against viral pathogens. While the bacterial recombinants described above are typically administered in polypeptide form, recombinants that confer viral protection are preferably administered in nucleic acid form, as genetic vaccines.
[0097] One illustrative example is the Hantaan virus. Glycoproteins of this virus typically accumulate at the membranes of the Golgi apparatus of infected cells. This poor expression of the glycoprotein prevents the development of efficient genetic vaccines against these viruses. The methods of the invention solve this problem by performing DNA shuffling on nucleic acids that encode the glycoproteins and identifying those recombinants that exhibit enhanced expression in a host cell, and/or for improved immunogenicity when administered as a genetic vaccine. A convenient screening method for these methods is to express the recombinant polynucleotides as fusion proteins to PIG, which results in display of the polypeptides on the surface of the host cell (Whitehorn et al. (1995) Biotechnology (NY) 13:1215-9). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting is then used to sort and recover those cells that express an increased amount of the antigenic polypeptide on the cell surface. This preliminary screen can be followed by immunogenicity tests in mammals, such as mice. Finally, in preferred embodiments, those recombinant nucleic acids are tested as genetic vaccines for their ability to protect a test animal against challenge by the virus.
[0098] The flaviviruses are another example of a viral pathogen for which the methods of the invention are useful for obtaining a recombinant polypeptide or genetic vaccine that is effective against a viral pathogen. The flaviviruses consist of three clusters of antigenically related viruses: Dengue 1-4 (62-77% identity), Japanese, St. Louis and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses (75-82% identity), and the tick-borne encephalitis viruses (77-96% identity). Dengue virus can induce protective antibodies against SLE and Yellow fever (40-50% identity), but few efficient vaccines are available. To obtain genetic vaccines and recombinant polypeptides that exhibit enhanced cross-reactivity and immunogenicity, the polynucleotides that encode envelope proteins of related viruses are subjected to DNA shuffling. The resulting recombinant polynucleotides can be tested, either as genetic vaccines or by using the expressed polypeptides, for ability to induce a broadly reacting neutralizing antibody response. Finally, those clones that are favorable in the preliminary screens can be tested for ability to protect a test animal against viral challenge.
