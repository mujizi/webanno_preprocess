A resistor and a capacitor, indicated R.sub.c and C.sub.c, are connected in parallel with each other between the earth and a junction N to which are connected the cathodes of diodes D.sub.c, each of which has its anode connected between a load L.sub.i and the associated controlled switch SW.sub.i. The diodes D.sub.c together form an OR-type circuit.
A further controlled switch SW.sub.4, similar to the above, is connected between the junction N and the input 1.
An electronic control unit produced in known manner is indicated ECU and comprises, for example, a microprocessor unit and input/output interface circuits. The unit ECU has a series of inputs connected to the earth of the circuit described above, to the positive pole of the supply V.sub.B, and to a sensor S which is adapted to provide electrical signals indicative of the current flowing in the storage coil L.sub.1 during operation. The sensor S may be constituted, for example, by a Hall-effect sensor. As an alternative to this solution, the non-earth terminal of the capacitor C may be connected to the unit ECU for detecting the current flowing in L.sub.1 : the voltage established across the terminals of C at particular stages of operation is related to the intensity of the current flowing in L.sub.1.
A further alternative solution for the detection of the current flowing in L.sub.1 could be constituted, for example, by a shunt resistor connected in series with L.sub.1 and connected to the ECU.
The unit ECU has a plurality of outputs connected in order to the control inputs of the switches SW.sub.1, SW.sub.2, SW.sub.3 and SW.sub.i.
