Freshly lyophilized preparations of reverse transcriptase, RNA polymerase, and Amplification Reagent were incubated at 25.degree. C., 35.degree. C. and 45.degree. C. for various times, ranging from 3 to 61 days. All vials were prepared identically from the same preparation. At the indicated time points vials containing the lyophilized reagents were removed from elevated temperature and stored at -30.degree. C. until the last samples had been collected. Samples representing the "zero" time for each temperature were stored at -30.degree. C. for the entire experimental time period.
When the vials from the last time point had been collected all samples were rehydrated in 1.5 ml of Reconstituting Reagent (0.01% (v/v) TRITON.RTM. X-102, 41.6 mM MgCl.sub.2, 1 mM ZnC.sub.2 H.sub.3 O.sub.2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.3% (v/v) ethanol, 0.02% (w/v) methyl paraben, and 0.01% (w/v) propyl paraben) and the contents of each vial assayed for the ability to cause nucleic acid amplification.
Activity in a model amplification system was measured in the following way in this example. Each amplification reaction mixture contained 500 copies of a double-stranded DNA restriction fragment from a plasmid containing part of the hepatitis B virus genome as the target nucleic acid (a PUC plasmid containing a 2.6 kb fragment of the hepatitis B virus genome). The target DNA was diluted in 20 .mu.l of either water or human serum. Negative controls were made in the same way, but without target DNA. This was added to 20 .mu.l of a 2X primer solution; the final composition of this solution was 0.1N KOH, 17.5 mM EGTA, 25 mM imidazole, 25 mM glutamic acid, 0.025% (w/v) phenol red, and 0.3 .mu.M of each of two primers in a total volume of 40 .mu.l. The first primer ((-) sense) consisted of a 3' target-binding nucleotide sequence region complementary to the (+) sense strand of the DNA target and a 5' non-complementary region was situated downstream from a 5' non-complementary region having the nucleotide sequence of the promoter for T7 RNA polymerase. The second primer ((+) sense) had a nucleotide sequence consisting of a target-binding region complementary to the other ((-) sense) DNA strand.
Each 40 .mu.l reaction mixture was incubated at about 95.degree. C. to denature the double-stranded DNA target. The reaction was then cooled to room temperature for 5 minutes and neutralized with 10 .mu.l of a buffer containing 330 mM imidazole and 200 mM glutamic acid. Had the target nucleic acid been RNA rather than DNA this denaturation step would not be necessary.
