The "free" switch 118 is used to generate a "free" signal to switch the detaching unit from an operating mode in which valid ID signals are required for tag removal to a "free" mode, in which no such signals are required. In other words, the "free" signal conditions the detaching unit to detach all tags presented for separation without interrogating the tags and without requiring a valid identification signal to be transmitted by the tag. The "control" switch 120 generates a signal to switch the detaching unit back into the operating mode in which either valid interrogation signals must be provided by the tags for detachment to occur, or a "one time" conditioning signal must have been provided.
FIG. 9 is a flow chart which illustrates software for controlling the control circuit 92 of a detaching unit intended to be used with the transmitter-key embodiment shown in FIG. 7. The first step shown in FIG. 9 is step 200, which corresponds to a "sleep mode" in which the detaching unit is not operative to perform any function except detecting an "on" signal transmitted from the transmitter-key device. Step 202 is indicative of the control circuit waiting to receive the "on" signal.
Once the "on" signal is received, the control circuit enters into the "control" mode of operation, as represented by block 204 in FIG. 9. This mode of operation essentially corresponds to the process illustrated in FIGS. 8A and 8B and described hereinabove. In connection with this process, the "one time" signal corresponding to switch 116 shown in FIG. 7 results in storage of the "detach next tag" signal referred to in connection with steps 162 and 152 in FIG. 8A.
The control mode of operation continues unless and until either the "off" signal is received (as indicated at step 206) or the "free" signal is received (as indicated at step 208). If the "off" signal is received, then the detaching unit returns to the sleep mode (step 200). If the "free" signal is received, then the detaching unit enters into the "free" mode of operation (represented by step 210), in which every tag presented for separation is automatically separated, without interrogating the tag for an identification signal or verifying that the identification signal is valid. It will be noted that the free mode of operation corresponds to the manner of operation of the conventional detachers described in the '419, '914 and '606 patents. The free mode continues unless and until either the "off" signal is received (step 212) or the "control" signal is received (step 214). If the "off" signal is received, then the detaching unit returns to the sleep mode (step 200). If the "control" signal is received, the detaching unit returns to the control mode of operation (step 204).
From the foregoing discussion, it will be understood that the transmitter-key embodiment of FIG. 7 is used for a number of functions. First, the transmitter-key of FIG. 7 is used to switch the detaching unit on and off. In addition, a "one time" conditioning signal can be generated using the transmitter-key to cause the detaching unit to detach the next tag presented, regardless of whether the tag provides a valid identification signal. The transmitter-key of FIG. 7 also is capable of generating a second type of conditioning signal, which causes the detaching unit to indefinitely continue in a mode of operation in which no identifying signal is required to enable detachment of tags. The transmitter-key is also operable to reverse the conditioning signal so that the detaching unit is returned to the mode in which detaching operations are controlled in response to identification data provided by the tags presented for detaching.
