6-(7-methoxy-2-trifluoromethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)-4,5-dihydro-5--methyl-3-(2H)-pyridazinone
[0628]Trifluoroacetic acid (2.47 g) was added to a solution of the compound of Example 162 (836 mg) in dichloromethane (1.0 mL). This mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 hours. Subsequently, the mixture was concentrated and was azeotropically distilled twice with toluene. The residue was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL). To this solution, acetic acid (781 mg) and hydrazine monohydrate (324 mg) were added and the mixture was refluxed for 36 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated. The concentrate was recrystallized from ethanol and the resultant crystals were recrystallized from ethyl acetate-hexane for further purification. This afforded the title compound as a pale yellow powder (488 mg). The product was identical to the compound of Example 205.
