[0151] Described herein are details on how the barring indication, the allowed access pattern access and the barring factor may be updated to access the RACH without the WTRU having to reacquire the system information or being reconfigured by the network.
[0152] A list of barring indications, allowed access patterns and/or barring factors may be broadcast in the SI. The mapping between the different barring indications, allowed access patterns and/or barring factors configurations and the WTRU or groups of WTRU may be broadcast. For example, a mapping table may include a list of indices on access timing configurations along with the corresponding access classes, (if applicable), and optionally barring factors for each configuration. When acquiring the SI, the WTRU may store this list and the current mapping. Later, the mapping may be updated by the network or autonomously by the WTRU following pre-determined rules and the new mapping be applied to a previously stored list of accesses. For example, the mapping may be updated via a page. The page may include a new mapping between the access timing configurations indexes and the access classes. The WTRU may not need to reacquire the SI, but may need to monitor the paging channel.
[0153] Additionally, times at which the WTRU may autonomously follow predetermined rules to update the mapping table may be broadcast. For instance, a rule may be to shift the table by one with a wrapping. In this solution, the WTRU my not receive a page except in one of the following instances that may require updating. For example, the WTRU may receive a page when automatic update of the mapping table may occur, cancellation of the automatic update, restart of the automatic update, and update of the rules for the automatic update. A new timer may be defined so that when it expires in the WTRU, the WTRU may perform the automatic update of the mapping table. Alternatively, this may be updated using RRC messages, such as RRC connection release or RRC connection reject. The PRACH resources may be part of one of the indexes used and changed.
[0154] Described herein is how to differentiate between access classes at the MAC level. In order to make the PRACH configuration index depend on the AC in LTE, certain PRACH configuration indexes may be allowed to certain AC, for example, as defined in a mapping table between AC and PRACH configuration indexes. Moreover, the table of PRACH configuration indexes may be updated so that additional combinations restricting the access to the RACH may be added. For instance, in addition to "even" or "any" SFN, a subset of SFNs may be allowed. Examples of additional restrictions may be an explicit list of SFNs allowed, an SFN occurring every N SFNs and odd SFNs may be allowed.
[0155] The known, existing or legacy tables may be extended with new PRACH configuration indexes, (higher than 63), or new table(s) may be defined. Networks may indicate in the SI which table to use.
