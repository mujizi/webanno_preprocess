[0144] When the switching unit 402 judges that three seconds have passed after the screen of output functions is displayed ("Yes" at step S1313), the switching unit 402 controls the display processing unit 401 to switch the screen to a screen of input functions (step S1314).
[0145] When the selection accepting unit 403 judges that the reception of the selection has ended ("Yes" at step S1312), the output processing unit 412 applies output processing by an output function corresponding to the item key, selection of which is accepted at step S1310, to the image data already subjected to the input processing at step S1304 (step S1315).
[0146] The processing procedure makes it easy for the user to select functions used in input processing and output processing and makes it possible to perform processing of image data using a requested function. The processing procedure indicates an example of a processing procedure from processing for displaying a screen of input functions until selection by the user is accepted and output processing is performed. The embodiment is not limited to this processing procedure.
[0147] In this embodiment, the display processing unit 401 arranged rectangular item keys lengthwise on the liquid crystal touch panel 320. However, the arrangement of the item keys is not limited to such an arrangement. As described below, various arrangements are conceivable. Other than the arrangements described below, any arrangement may be adopted as long as it is possible to switch an item key indicating an input function and an item key indicating an output function.
[0148] FIG. 14 is a diagram of an example in which item keys displayed on the liquid crystal touch panel 320 are arranged sideways. Except the arrangement of the item keys shown in the figure; the same processing as this embodiment is performed. The same holds true for FIGS. 15, 16, and 17.
