2. Description of the Related Art
In data storage environments such as corporate LANs, total storage needs are increasing and storage costs are an increasing part of the IT budget. More and/or higher capacity storage devices may be added, but this solution is expensive and difficult to manage, and does not address the root of the problem. There is a limit to storage capacity no matter how much storage capacity is added. This solution tends to provide a constant cost per byte for storage, as it tends not to take advantage of lower cost-per-byte storage devices. A high percentage of data stored in a storage environment may be infrequently accessed, or never accessed at all after a certain time. Lower cost-per-byte for storage may be realized using methods that move at least some of this infrequently accessed data off more expensive storage devices and on to the less expensive storage devices.
Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) is a data storage solution that provides access to vast amounts of storage space while reducing the administrative and storage costs associated with data storage. HSM systems may move files along a hierarchy of storage devices that may be ranked in terms of cost per megabyte of storage, speed of storage and retrieval, and overall capacity limits. Files are migrated along the hierarchy to less expensive forms of storage based on rules tied to the frequency of data access.
In HSM systems, data access response time and storage costs typically determine the appropriate combination of storage devices used. A typical three tier HSM architecture may include hard drives as primary storage, rewritable optical as secondary storage, and tape as tertiary storage. Alternatively, hard drives may be used for secondary storage, and WORM (Write Once, Read Many) optical may be used as tertiary storage.
