DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Firstly, the present invention will be discussed from a theoretical standpoint. It should however be borne in mind that the present invention is by no means limited by or to the following theoretical discussion.
As a process commonly usable for obtaining boron-substituted graphite, it is most convenient to graphitize a carbonaceous material in the presence of a boron compound as proposed y C. E. Lowell in Journal of The American Ceramic Society, 50(3), 142 (1967). Upon practicing this process, mixing of the boron compound and the carbonaceous material into a homogeneous mixture is important for evenly substituting boron for a portion of the carbon atoms in the carbonaceous material. To achieve this, some methods can be contemplated, including making smaller the particle size of a boron compound to be mixed or adding and mixing a boron compound in a liquid form. About specific methods for evenly mixing a boron compound in a carbonaceous material, a detained description will be made subsequently herein.
The boron material to be added to the carbonaceous material can be in any chemical form, including boron element, inorganic boron compounds such as boric acid, boron oxide and boron carbide, and organic boron compounds. Preferred as the carbonaceous material, however, is one having good wetting property for the boron compound to be added, permitting easy formation of boron carbide, and also having high graphitizability. As a rationale for the requirement of such a carbonaceous material, the substitution of boron for carbon and the conversion of carbon into a solid solution with boron is believed to proceed as will be described hereinafter.
As a mixture of a carbonaceous material and a boron compound is heated and raised in temperature in an atmosphere unreactive with boron, they first act each other and form boron carbide irrespective of the form of the boron compound so added. At this time, the reaction velocity of the formation of boron carbide considerably varies depending on the nature of the carbonations material employed as a raw material. The carbonaceous material to be used, therefore, may preferably be one having good wetting property to the boron compound and permitting easy formation of the carbide of boron. At each interface of boron carbide so formed, there is a region where a solid solution of carbon and boron, said solid solution being represented by B.sub.4 C.sub.1-x (0<x<0.65), is formed. From this region, boron spreads into a carbon structure while forming a solid solution. Owing to this spreading in the form of the solid solution, resulting graphite crystals are rendered free of distortion and as a consequence, boron-substituted graphite with a well-developed graphite structure is formed.
