[0165] Specificity of Prion Detection by saPMCA
[0166] Specificity of detection is very important for a diagnostic assay. Specificity of cyclic amplification was evaluated in a blind study in which 10 brain samples of scrapie-affected hamsters and 11 samples of healthy animals were subjected to 48 PMCA cycles and PrP.sup.Sc was detected by Western blot analysis after proteinase K (PK) digestion. The results showed that, while 100% of the samples derived from sick animals were positive after PMCA, none of the samples coming from normal animals showed any PrP.sup.Sc signal. Out of the 10 positive control samples, 7 corresponded to a 10,000-fold dilution of brain, 2 corresponded to a 50,000-fold dilution and 1 corresponded to a 100,000-fold dilution. None of these 10 samples showed any PrP.sup.Sc signal in Western blot without PMCA amplification (data not shown). The interpretation of this data is that, under the conditions used, PMCA leads to 100% specificity in PrP.sup.Sc detection.
[0167] As demonstrated before, the amplification rate using PMCA depends upon the number of incubation/sonication cycles carried out (Saborio et al., 2001). Thus, the inventors decided to evaluate whether a PrP.sup.Sc-like signal might appear on negative samples after many PMCA cycles. For this purpose, a 10% healthy hamster brain homogenate in the absence (negative control) or in the presence (positive control) of an aliquot of a 50,000-fold diluted scrapie brain was subjected to 24, 48, 96, or 144 PMCA cycles and PrP.sup.Sc signal detected by Western blot analysis. The results clearly indicated that PrP.sup.Sc reactivity was detected only after PMCA in the positive control samples with an intensity that depended upon the number of cycles performed. In comparison, in the negative control samples, no PrP.sup.Sc was ever detected, regardless the number of PMCA cycles carried out. In order to evaluate the relationship between the extent of PrP.sup.Sc formation and the number of PMCA cycles, the inventors attempted to fit the data to a mathematical formula. Taking into account all the points available (again done by triplicate) the best fitting was obtained with a sigmoidal curve (Equation: signal intensity=1882/(1+e.sup.-(number of cycles-53.6)/21.8), indicating that after an exponential relationship between the extent of conversion and the number of cycles, the formation of new PrP.sup.Sc reaches a plateau. This plateau can be due to the exhaustion of all PrP.sup.C substrate by conversion into PrP.sup.Sc or to the lost of conversion efficacy by inactivation of the substrate or putative conversion factors after long times of incubation/sonication. This problem was resolved by saPMCA. When the data was fitted excluding the last time point, the best fit was obtained with an exponential curve (Equation: signal intensity=67/e.sup.0.98(number of cycles)). These findings support the idea of an exponential dependence on the number of PMCA cycles when conversion conditions are not limiting (less than 100 cycles).
[0168] Specificity was further studied in an even more challenging situation in which several rounds of PMCA were done after diluting the material to refresh the substrate. Brains from healthy hamsters and from animals infected with 263K scrapie were diluted 10.sup.4-fold into a 10% normal hamster brain homogenate. Samples were subjected to 48 PMCA cycles. After this first round of PMCA, a small aliquot of the amplified samples was taken and diluted 10-fold into more normal brain homogenate. These samples were again amplified by 48 PMCA cycles. This procedure was repeated several times and PrP.sup.Sc generation was determined by Western blot analysis after PK digestion. In this study 10 rounds of PMCA to reach a final dilution of the original brain equivalent to 10.sup.-13 led to continuous formation of PrP.sup.Sc only when the initial inoculum was derived from scrapie-infected animals. No PrP.sup.Sc was ever detected in the absence of PrP.sup.Sc inoculum, indicating that, even after 480 PMCA cycles, the system retains high specificity and no false positive samples were observed.
