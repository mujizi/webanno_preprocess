Compound 11 (Biotin-Monomer)
[0102] To compound 10 (500 mg) was added 4M HCl in dioxane, and stirred for 1 hr at room temperature. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the crude product dissolved into a solution of 0.25 M aqueous sodium bicarbonate with DMF. To this solution was added dropwise a solution of compound 2. The reaction was monitored via TLC by ninhydrin stain for primary amines and confirmed to be complete after 30 min. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the crude product was purified by silica column chromatography. .sup.1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl.sub.3): .delta.
