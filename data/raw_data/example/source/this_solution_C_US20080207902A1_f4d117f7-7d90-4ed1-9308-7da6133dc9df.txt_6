Example 43
4-acetyloxymethyl-3-ethoxycarbonyl-2-formyl-4-methoxy-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrid-ine
[0250]The compound of Example 42 (2.01 g) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of acetone and water (2:1). To this solution, p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (97.3 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours while heated at 70.degree. C. After cooling, the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=1:2) to afford the title compound as a colorless powder (1.47 g).
