[0049] Lead 40 includes an outer jacket 42 and a coiled stylet guide 46 positioned within a lumen formed by outer jacket 42. Coiled stylet guide 46 may be formed by flat or cylindrical wires, which may be electrically conductive or nonconductive. Outer jacket 42 may comprise an external diameter of approximately 0.045 to 0.055 inches (0.114 to 0.14 cm), and more preferably approximately 0.052 inches (0.13 cm). Stylet guide 46 may comprise an external diameter of approximately 0.012 to 0.020 inches (0.03 to 0.05 cm), and more preferably approximately 0.016 inches (0.04 cm). A set of conductors 45 wraps around stylet guide 46 to form one or more conductor coils 44. In the illustrated embodiment, lead 40 comprises an octad lead with eight conductors included in set of conductors 45. In other embodiments, lead 40 may comprise a quad lead including four electrodes or another type of lead including any number of electrodes.
[0050] In some embodiments, lead 40 provides enhanced stretchability to prevent lead failure, axial migration, anchor damage, and/or tissue damage at anchor points during typical patient movement. Outer jacket 42 may be made of an extruded or molded material, e.g., a polyurethane material, with a substantially low durometer. Conductors 45 may comprise braided strand wire (BSW) cables that provide increased flexibility.
[0051] Conductors 45 may be constructed as BSW cables wound into a helix. Coiling or helically winding conductors 45 into conductor coil 44 allows conductors 45 to elongate or stretch as lead 40 experiences axial loading forces during use. Helically wound conductors 45 may provide desirable axial compliance as well as needed bend-flex fatigue life. In a case of severe buckling, the helically wound conductors 45 may collapse, binding the conductors and concentrating the bend into a small radius. To address this problem, as described above, a reinforcement wire may be helically wound with the wound conductors 45 in a way that prevents bilateral collapse of the structure during buckling. The wound reinforcement wire also may be helically extruded, forming a helical channel in which the conductors reside, as will be described in greater detail herein.
[0052] Coiled wire stylet guide 46 creates a lumen 47 to receive a stylet 48. In some cases, stylet 48 comprises a wire with a diameter between approximately 0.012 inches and 0.01 inches (0.03 cm and 0.025 cm). Stylet 48 may be inserted into lumen 47 of stylet guide 46 to steer lead 40 to a target site within a patient's body. The coil design of stylet guide 46 eases the insertion and withdrawal of stylet 48 by forming a smooth path along which stylet 48 slides. In addition, coiled wire stylet guide 46 may enhance steerability of lead 40, which increases accuracy when positioning lead 40 within a patient.
[0053] At a distal end of lead 40, not shown, stylet guide 46 may be sealed such that stylet 48 cannot extend beyond the distal end of lead 40. Sealing the distal end of stylet guide 46 decreases the probability of inadvertently puncturing epidural tissue and causing a "wet tap," or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak, which is an event that may cause severe headaches or, if the leak is severe, may cause neurological damage. A CSF leak may occur if stylet 48 extends beyond stylet guide 46 into the epidural region proximate the spine of a patient, causing a puncture in the dura membrane of the epidural region.
