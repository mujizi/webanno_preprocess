BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
This invention pertains to the construction arts and, more particularly, to the construction of walls and ceilings using wallboard panels. These panels are usually rectangular -- a standard size, for example, being 4 .times. 12 feet. The surfaces along the longer edges are usually recessed for receiving tape. Thus, the finished wall surface along these edges is normally smooth and flat. The shorter edges, however, are not so recessed, nor are the edges which result from cutting the panels on the job. It has been customary in the art to butt these edges on a joist to which both panels can be secured by nailing or adhesive. Subsequent taping and finishing, however, form a ridge which is particularly noticeable under conditions of oblique lighting.
It has been proposed in the past to obviate this problem by forming the joint between joists while bending the ends of the panels inwardly at the joint to form a depression which can then be built out to the wall surface. However, this requires a two-step process including the construction of a "back block" between joists to which adhesive is applied. The panels are then installed and the abutting edges pressed inwardly against the adhesive until it sets.
Accordingly, it is the primary object of this invention to provide a simplified wall or ceiling construction which eliminates the ridge formed at butt joints. Other objects are to provide such a construction which employs inexpensive clips which are readily installed on the job. Other objects, features, and advantages will be readily apparent from the following description and the appended claims.
