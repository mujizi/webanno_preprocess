Example 127
N-t-butoxycarbonyl-2-ethyl-7-methylamino-4-propionyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridi-ne
[0419]The compound of Example 126 (208 mg) was dissolved in acetonitrile (10.0 mL). To this solution, di-tert-butyl-di-carbonate (236 mg) and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine were added and the mixture was stirred for 6 hours under reflux. Subsequently, water was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification of the residue by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=5:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (298 mg).
