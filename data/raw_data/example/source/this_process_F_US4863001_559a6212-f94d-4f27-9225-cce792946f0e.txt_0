Each metal clip 130 is generally U-shaped in configuration having a pair of side portions 131-132 and a bridging portion with a driving face 133 interconnecting such side portions. The uppermost edge portion of bridging portion 133 is recessed as at 134 for a purpose to be described. Extending downwardly from bridging portion 133 of clip 130 is an arcuate extension or arcuately shaped projection 135 that frictionally contacts the walls of the arcuately shaped recess 128 similarly to the other described embodiments. The interior walls of the side portions 131-132 have a pair of recesses 136.
A U-shaped bracket or retainer 140 as seen in FIGS. 20 and 23 has a pair of downwardly disposed leg portions 141 and an upper horizontally disposed bridging portion 142. Bridging portion 142 has its forwardly disposed portion as seen in FIG. 24 recessed at the respective side edges to provide a forwardly disposed portion 143 which has an arcuately shaped end or edge 144 for engaging recess 134 in a manner to be described. The respective side portions 141 of bracket 140 have a spring clip 145 formed thereon as by cutting the forwardly disposed side portion of each side or leg portion 141 and thence pressing the clip 145 outwardly as depicted by FIG. 22 to provide resiliency thereto as in a spring clip through suitable heat treating process. In assembling the clip and the retainer 140 the purpose of the recesses 136 is to allow the spring clips 145 to spring outwardly into the recesses 136 to assure a secure fastening of the clips 130 to the retainer.
To assemble the clips 130 and the U-shaped bracket or retainer 140 onto the rotor brake disc 115, one clip 130 is first rocked into position in the same manner as the other described embodiment then the U-shaped bracket or retainer 140 is placed on the rotor and slid into the clip 130 as far as possible such that one arcuately shaped end or edge 144 projects beyond the clip 130 and the other arcuately shaped end or edge 144 rests in the top surface of brake disc 115. In this process the spring clip 145 of retainer 140 snaps into recess 136 of the clip 130. The recess 136 is sufficiently long along an arcuate path of the brake disc 115 to allow the spring clip 145 to move linearly and to allow the forwardly disposed edge 144 of retainer 140 to slide past the driving face 133 of the briding portion of clip 130. A second clip 130 is then rocked into place on the nearest face of an adjacent slot 125. U-shaped bracket or retainer 140 is then slid back along the periphery of the brake disc 115 until the forwardly disposed edge 144 of retainer 140 drops down over the edge 133 of the second clip 130 into the recess 134 and the spring clip 145 of the retainer 140 adjacent to such second clip 130 snaps into the recess 136 of such second clip 130. The retainer thus assures the retention of the clips in their respective positions in the slots 125 while preventing the oxidation of the periphery of the brake discs 115.
It will be apparent that, although a specific embodiment and certain modifications of the invention have been described in detail, the invention is not limited to the specifically illustrated and described constructions since variations may be made without departing from the principles of the invention.
