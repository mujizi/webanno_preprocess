Substituting Equation (39) into Equation 36) yields Equation (40) as follows:
.gamma..alpha..times..times..function..tau..function..times..function..al- pha..times..function..times..function..times..function..times..times..alph- a..times..times..function..tau. ##EQU00017## If it is assumed that the spacing is small (e.g., kd<<.pi., where k=.omega./c is the wavenumber, and d is the spacing) and the signal m(t) is relatively low-passed, then the following approximation holds: R.sub.xx(.tau.).apprxeq.R.sub.11(0). With this assumption, the optimal combining coefficient .gamma..sub.opt is given by Equation (41) as follows:
.gamma..apprxeq..alpha..times..function..times..function..alpha..times..f- unction..times..function..times..function. ##EQU00018## One limitation to this solution is the case when the two microphones are placed in the nearfield, especially when the spacing from the source to the first microphone is smaller than the spacing between the microphones. For this case, the optimum combiner will select the microphone that has the lowest signal. This problem can be seen if we assume that the noise signals are zero and .alpha.=0.5 (the rear microphone is attenuated by 6 dB). FIG. 9 shows a plot of Equation (41) for values of 0.ltoreq..alpha..ltoreq.1 for no noise (n.sub.1(t)=n.sub.2(t)=0). As can be seen in FIG. 9, as the amplitude scale factor .alpha. goes from zero to unity, the optimum value of the combining coefficient .gamma. goes from unity to one-half.
Thus, for nearfield sources with no noise, the optimum combiner will move towards the microphone with the lower power. Although this is what is desired when there is asymmetric wind noise, it is desirable to select the higher-power microphone for the wind noise-free case. In order to handle this specific case, it is desirable to form a robust wind-noise detector that is immune to the nearfield effect. This topic is covered in a later section.
