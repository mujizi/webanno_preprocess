[0013] While more compact than the previously mentioned devices, the device of FIG. 1A still suffers from several practical problems. First, the device of FIG. 1A is still very large in all dimensions with respect to the size of the illumination aperture and has the additional disadvantage of being energetically inefficient. In practice, the requirement of uniform illumination with cavital design is difficult to achieve, in particular for larger and thinner configurations, i.e., larger aspect ratio designs. Indeed, the performance of such a device imposes two conflicting requirements on AR. On one hand, to achieve brightness uniformity the AR should be small, assuring that all of the cavity's surfaces projecting through the exit aperture are uniformly illuminated by a relatively small number of multiple interreflections (MIRs) of the highly nonuniform light flux emanating from the light source. This reduces reflection losses and increases efficiency. On the other hand, the AR should be sufficiently large to allow a commercially and technically acceptable depth dimension of a device. As a result, prior art devices are bulky in terms of depth dimension and/or cannot assure an acceptable uniformity for larger displays. Typical devices require that 4<AR<10 as specified in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,043,591, while analysis indicates that the achievable uniformity with such designs is only on the order of 1.3:1. While these performance criteria may be suitable for some LCD applications, they are not sufficient for applications using multi-colored LED sources, as described below, in which a uniformity between the illumination colors of 1.05:1 is required in order to prevent perceivable color shifts.
[0014] A partial solution known as a compound cavity-TIR system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,043,591, which suggests filling the cavity with a fluid. However, the internal reflections within the fill medium are still diffuse at all lambertian cavital surfaces, as a result of direct optical contact. In fact, only an upper surface of such filled cavity acts as a light guide, but its ratio to the total surface area of the cavity is too small to have any significant positive effect. As a result, such systems fail to appreciably improve the backlight luminance efficiency and achievable AR.
[0015] As noted above, the best solution to date for small-aperture LED-illuminated backlights would seem to be the use of a light guiding plate (LGP), which distributes the light flux by total internal reflection (TIR). However as realized herein, several practical problems inherent to such a system are compounded in the case of small-aperture LGP-based backlights. A first of these practical problems include the fact that a relatively thick planar LGP, with 1<AR<10, suffers from elevated light flux losses, since, with existing extraction means, a large fraction of the LED-injected flux inevitably reaches the opposite edge of the LGP and is coupled out on the proximal outer reflector; it is then coupled again into the LGP, travels in a reverse direction and eventually ends up on the LED, where it is totally or partially absorbed. An optimal LGP should reduce this residual flux and ensure that a maximal fraction of the initially forward propagating flux from the LED should be extracted in a first pass. Even with thinner LGPs, e.g., 1-2 mm, having optimized extractor distributions described below, the AR is still relatively small so as to make this problem significant.
[0016] Light extraction in a flat illumination device ("FID") can also be effected by using a tapered LGP the faces of which are mutually inclined at some angle THETA, thus forming a wedge, rather than a planar parallel-faced plate. As the flux from the lamp, coupled to the edge of the plate, propagates along the wedge, the angles of incidence IIHI are reduced by 2.theta. at each reflection from the inclined face(s). When the angle .phi. of any flux component becomes smaller than a critical angle of TIR, this flux is coupled out from both faces of the LGP in a number of successive reflections in a forward direction, following the Fresnel equations. The flux is extracted at the directions close to the grazing angles and some internal or external diffusing and/or concentrating elements can be used to modify the spatial luminance, or luminous intensity distribution, to satisfy the particular requirements. Some of the forward propagating flux reaching the opposite and adjacent LGP edges is eventually reflected by an external reflector into a backward path, as well as sideways skewed paths. Linear one dimensional (i.e., having constant inclination angle along one orthogonal direction) wedge-like LGPs are described in relation to a number of FIDs, in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,104,455 and 6,259,496. However, these linear wedge shaped devices inherently produce a significantly non-uniform luminance, this non-uniformity growing with the LGP's length.
[0017] U.S. Pat. No. 5,357,405 describes a nonlinear semicylindrical concave surface which effects, in combination with additional light extracting means, better uniformity. This one-dimensional nonlinear wedge is not designed to produce uniform luminance independently. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,303,322; 6,002,829 and 6,044,196 describe the possibility of using a one-dimensional nonlinear wedge for compensating light output irregularities for a special type of tapered multilayer devices that are very different from the FIDs under consideration. These patents fail to teach any practical solutions and in fact, the expanding convex wedges qualitatively depicted therein necessarily suffer from augmented non-uniformity as compared to linear wedges. Further, the attempt to analyze the problem using general adiabatic invariant cannot produce any meaningful solution since one has to consider the exact convolutions of Fresnel equations in three dimensional domain with complex boundary conditions, imposed by the LGP shape, and backward propagating residual flux.
