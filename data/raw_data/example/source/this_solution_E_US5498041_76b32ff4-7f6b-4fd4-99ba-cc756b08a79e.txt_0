Prior gate latch assemblies also generally rely upon gravity to bias the latching pawl to secure an appropriate latch bar. When a pull cord is provided through the gate post, latch assemblies, which have been exposed to varied weather conditions and foreign debris do not operate as smoothly as corresponding new assemblies. As a result, parts which are biased merely by gravity tend to resist movement resulting in the failure to appropriately latch the gate to the post without the user having to positively engage the pawl with the latch bar. Once the pull cord is actuated, a weathered gate latch assembly may not adequately release the latch bar and the user may be forced to reach over the gate itself to physically pull the latch bar from the latch frame.
Virtually no prior gate latch assemblies allow the user to actuate the assembly employing a pull cord without need for the use of one's hands. Oftentimes, users approaching a gate are carrying objects which prevent them from using their hands to actuate the gate latch assembly. Even if this were not a problem, prior assemblies, particularly those which have been in service for some time, do not encourage the latch bar's release from the latch frame and, as such, the user must not only pull an appropriate actuating cord but simultaneously push the gate forward prior to release of the latching pawl or the latch bar would simply be recaptured by the pawl and remain within the latch frame.
Finally, a major deficiency in virtually all prior gate latch assemblies is the failure over time for the latch bar and slot in the latch frame becoming misaligned. As noted previously, this deficiency was recognized and dealt with in U.S. Pat. No. 3,433,518 by increasing the width of the slot so that even grossly misaligned latch bars will be accepted by the latch frame. However, this solution has proven to be grossly inadequate as such configuration lacks the precision deemed desirable in any gate latch assembly.
It is an object of the present invention to provide a gate latch assembly for releasably holding a gate in a closed position relative to a gate post while improving over corresponding assemblies of the prior art.
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a gate latch assembly for releasably holding a gate in a closed position relative to a gate post while remedying the various deficiencies recited above and which characterize virtually all prior designs.
