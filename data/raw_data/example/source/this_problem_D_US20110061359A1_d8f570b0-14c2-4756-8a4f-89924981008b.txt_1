[0075] Only when these criteria are simultaneously fulfilled may one reliably assume that a proper slub and not a yarn imperfection is present.
[0076] The differentiation between the virtual base yarn and slubs is simplified even greater by way of a further embodiment of the method according to the invention. According to this embodiment, the idealized course of the curve according to FIG. 19 is subtracted from the real measurement curve. This is schematically represented in FIG. 22. In this, FIG. 22(a) shows the curve of the original readings, FIG. 22(b) the idealized curve (cf. FIG. 19), and FIG. 22(c) the curve which arises when one subtracts the idealized curve from the original measurement curve. The curve of FIG. 22(b) shows only the (idealized) slubs, the curve of FIG. 22(c) only the virtual base yarn without slubs. These representations alone may contribute to a deeper understanding of the structure of the examined fancy yarn. The data obtained in this manner may however be evaluated even further, as is discussed hereinafter.
[0077] FIG. 23 schematically shows results of an evaluation of the data of FIG. 22 in a spectrogram, i.e. in a representation which corresponds to that of FIG. 18. FIG. 23(a) shows the spectrogram of the original readings, i.e. the curve of FIG. 21(a). As already indicated above, it is difficult or even impossible to differentiate between slubs and virtual base yarn only by way of this spectrogram. The representations of the FIGS. 23(b) and (c) alleviate this problem. FIG. 23(b) shows the spectrogram of the slubs alone, i.e. of the curve of FIG. 22(b). This data related to the slub permits malfunctioning in the slub production to be localized and overcome in a targeted manner, or permits the slub production to be changed in a targeted manner. Peaks in the long-waved region may e.g. indicate undesired periodicities, which may be avoided with suitable measures. FIG. 23(c) shows the spectrogram of the virtual base yarn, i.e. of the curve of FIG. 22(c). Any peaks in this spectrogram give good hints as to certain faults in the spinning process, or in the process stages preceding the spinning process, such as eccentricities of certain rollers in the drawing arrangement. These faults may be localized by way of the respective wavelengths in the spectrogram of FIG. 23(c), and subsequently dealt with.
[0078] The data of FIG. 22 may just as easily be represented in a scatter diagram, analogously to FIG. 6. This form of representation may also be very useful in order to differentiate between slubs and the virtual base yarn. A schematic example is specified in FIG. 24. FIG. 24(a) shows a scatter diagram of the original readings of the curve of FIG. 22(a). Here, three phenomena intermingle: [0079]the lesser disturbing thick places occurring in each yarn, [0080]slubs and [0081]thick places wrongly evaluated as slubs.
[0082] FIG. 24(b) shows a scatter diagram of the slubs on their own, as they are represented in FIG. 22(b). In particular, when the robust method for slub recognition described on the occasion of FIG. 21 is used, this scatter diagram will have no points which undesirably originate from imperfections such as thick places. Rather it only contains real slubs. FIG. 24(c) shows a scatter diagram of the virtual base yarn of FIG. 22(c). The points drawn therein do not represent slubs, but imperfections such as thick places. The scatter diagram of FIG. 24(c) may provide information on the applied yarn manufacturing process.
