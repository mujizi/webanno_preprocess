BACKGROUND--DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART
Ever since modern machines moved washday activities inside, there has been a long recognized and unfilled need to eliminate the requirement for a dedicated laundry room in living units while still having the capability to wash clothes without making an outside trip and without having to do it by hand.
Another long recognized and unfilled need is the lack of laundry facilities in a living unit such as an apartment or mobile home which does not have a designated laundry area set aside and dedicated to full time occupancy by laundry machines. This need has been recognized as is evidenced by many inventions of compact or portable machines. However, these inventions have such a greatly reduced capacity or increased inconvenience that it has not been commercially accepted as a solution to this problem. Thus, the commercial success of the local Laundromat.
Keeping clothes clean has been a problem since ancient times. Early in the history of this country pioneers washed their clothes by dipping them in the water of the river and rubbing them on rocks near the water. However, a trip outside the home to the local laundry facility was required.
The forerunner of the modern washing machine was a washboard. Using the washboard was somewhat like washing in the river. The user dipped the clothes in a tub of water and rubbed the clothes on the washboard. No longer was a trip to the river necessary. However, the drudgery and dedication of time remained.
