The drawing is a simplified flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of apparatus suitable for carrying out the process of the present invention.
In accordance with the present invention, metal is recovered from an aqueous medium containing the metal in soluble forms by inoculating or contacting the aqueous medium with a live fungus for a period of time sufficient to allow the fungus to convert soluble metals to an insoluble form of the metal, separating the fungus containing captured metal from the aqueous medium and recovering metal from the fungus.
The present invention may be employed to recover either precious metals or base metals. For example, the process of the invention may be used to recover in insoluble forms the precious metals platinum, rhodium, palladium, ruthenium, iridium and gold. Base metals which may be recovered by this process include zinc, aluminum, iron, copper, nickel, cobalt, manganese and chromium. Other metals which may be recovered by use of the invention include rhenium, silver, boron, tin and iridium. By means of the invention, metals present in an aqueous medium in soluble forms are converted into insoluble solid forms. Specific examples of fungi which have been found useful in the process of this invention are Cladosporium, Penicillium, Trichoderma, a black cephalosporial mold, designated Black Fungus, and a black chlamydosporial mold, identified as a non-sporulating strain of Aureobasidium, designated Black Mycelium.
The fungus cultures which are employed may be prepared and maintained by conventional biological procedures well known in the art.
One embodiment of this invention involves inoculating or contacting the aqueous medium containing dissolved metal with live fungus under growth conditions for a period of time sufficient to allow the fungus to grow and simultaneously convert soluble metal to insoluble metallic forms. A single fungus species or a mixture may be used in the process. The fungi usually are found admixed with one another in their natural environment.
