[0013] The technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to develop a motor having structural and functional features which remove above said drawbacks.
[0014] The idea of the solution on which the present invention is based is to avoid pressure differences occurring between the inside of the rotor chamber and the outside.
[0015] Based on this solution concept, the technical problem is solved by an electric motor according to claim 1.
[0016] This electric motor comprises a valve which allows fluid to flow from said rotor chamber.
[0017] Preferably, said valve is unidirectional (check valve), in particular of the flap valve type.
