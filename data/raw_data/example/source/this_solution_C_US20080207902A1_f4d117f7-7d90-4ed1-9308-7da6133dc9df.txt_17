Example 91
4-t-butyldimethylsilyloxymethyl-2-trifluoromethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
[0344]The compound of Example 64 (5.17 g, crude product) was dissolved in DMF (100 mL). To this solution, imidazole (4.89 g) and t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (4.33 g) were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours. Subsequently, water was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=9:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow oil (3.42 g).
