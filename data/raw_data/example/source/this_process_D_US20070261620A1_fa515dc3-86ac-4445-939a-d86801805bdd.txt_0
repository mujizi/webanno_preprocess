[0008] Further, multi-needle quilting machines lack flexibility. Most provide a line or an array of fixed needles that operate simultaneously to sew the same pattern and identical series of stitches. Changing the pattern requires the physical setting, rearrangement or removal of needles and the threading of the altered arrangement of needles. Such reconfiguration takes operator time and substantial machine down-time.
[0009] Traditional chain stitch machines used for quilting reciprocate one or more needles through thick multi-layered material using a crank mechanism driven by a rotary shaft. The force of a drive motor, as well as inertia of the linkage, forces the needle through the material. The needle motion so produced is traditionally sinusoidal, that is, it is defined by a curve represented by the equation y=sin e x. For purposes of this application, motion that does not satisfy that equation will be characterized as non-sinusoidal. Thus, the needle motion carries a needle tip from a raised position of, for example, one inch above the material, downward through material compressed to approximately 1/4 inch, to a point about 1/2 inch below the material where its motion reverses. The needle carries a needle thread through the material and presents a loop on the looper side of the material to be picked up by a looper thread. On the looper side of a material, a looper or hook is reciprocated about a shaft in a sinusoidal rotary motion. The looper is positioned relative to the needle such that its tip enters the needle thread loop presented by the needle to extend a loop of looper thread through the needle thread loop on the looper side of the material. The motion of the looper is synchronized with motion of the needle so that the needle thread loop is picked up by the looper thread when the needle is at the downward extent of its cycle. The needle then rises and withdraws from the material and leaves the needle thread extending around the looper and looper thread loop.
[0010] When the needle is withdrawn from the material, the material is shifted relative to the stitching elements and the needle again descends through the material at a distance equal to one stitch length from the previous point of needle penetration, forming one stitch. When again through the material, the needle inserts the next loop of needle thread through a loop formed in the looper thread that was previously poked by the looper through the previous needle thread loop. At this point in the cycle, the looper itself has already withdraw from the needle thread loop, in its sinusoidal reciprocating motion, leaving the looper thread loop extending around a stitch assisting element, known as a retainer in many machines, which holds the looper thread loop open for the next decent of a needle. In this process, needle thread loops are formed and passed through looper thread loops as looper thread loops are alternatively formed and passed through needle thread loops, thereby producing a chain of loops of alternating needle and looper thread along the looper side of the material, leaving a series of stitches formed only of the needle thread visible on the needle side of the material.
[0011] The traditional sinusoidal motion of the needle and looper in a chain stitch forming machine have, through years of experience, been adjusted to maintain reliable loop-taking by the thread so that stitches are not missed in the sewing process. In high speed quilting machines, the motion of the needle is such that the needle tip is present below the plane of the material, or a needle plate that supports the material, for approximately 1/3 of the cycle of the needle, or 120 degrees of the needle cycle.
[0012] During the portion of the needle cycle when the needle extends through the material, no motion of the material relative to the needle is preferred. Inertia of machine components and material causes some of the between-stitch motion of material relative to the needle to occur with the needle through the material. This results in needle deflection, which can cause missed stitches as the looper misses a needle thread loop or the needle misses a looper thread loop, or causes loss of pattern definition as material stretches and distorts. Further, limiting the time of needle penetration of the fabric defines the speed of the needle through the fabric, which determines the ability of the needle to penetrate thick multi-layered material. Increase of the needle speed then requires increasing the distance of needle travel, which causes excess needle thread slack below the fabric that must be pulled up to tighten the stitches during the formation of the stitches. Accordingly, the traditional needle motion has imposed limitations on chain stitch sewing and particularly on high speed quilting.
