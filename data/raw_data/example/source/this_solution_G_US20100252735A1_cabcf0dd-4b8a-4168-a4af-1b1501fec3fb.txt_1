[0055] A system for implementing the method of the invention may be based on a commercial electron microscope. Yet a microscope of this type generally comprises a main objective lens with a focal length of around 1 mm and high magnification (around 50), which does not permit the performance of measurements at low or medium resolution and with a large field of view.
[0056] Consequently, to implement the method of the invention with a sufficiently wide field of view, i.e. of several .mu.m.sup.2 (hereafter "wide field mode"), it is necessary not to supply the main objective lens and to use, as the objective lens, another lens of the column situated further downstream in the direction of propagation of the electron beam.
[0057] This solution is not satisfactory. Specifically: [0058]The arrangement of the microscope column does not generally allow the insertion of a diaphragm in the focal plane of the lens used as the objective lens. Yet a diaphragm is necessary in order to select the first-order diffracted electron beams; to do this, it is therefore obligatory to use the diaphragm of the main objective lens. However, the electron beams are not focused in the plane of this diaphragm; these beams will therefore be cut off asymmetrically at angles that depend on the area of the specimen they have come from. This introduces an off-axis distortion of the image. In addition, in order not to cut off the diffracted beams excessively, it is necessary to make use of a relatively wide diaphragm which does not effectively eliminate the diffused electrons. This results in a reduction in the image contrast. [0059]In wide field mode the optical system of the microscope does not allow a true focused image of the main objective lens diaphragm to be formed. It is therefore difficult to place. [0060]The electron beam diffracted by the specimen must be centered on the optical axis of the microscope and propagate parallel to the latter. This means that the incident beam must be sufficiently inclined. Yet, in wide field mode conventional illumination systems strongly limit the maximum angle of inclination of the incident electron beam, which makes it obligatory to use a very high energy beam for which the diffraction angle is relatively small. Even with this precaution, some specimens remain beyond the range of the method.
[0061] The use of a microscope in dual-lens mode (see document U.S. Pat. No. 7,015,469) makes it possible to reduce this latter problem but allows the others to persist.
[0062] The electron optical device which constitutes one of the subjects of the invention allows these problems to be solved. Furthermore, this device may also be applied in other bright field electron holography techniques.
