[0031] In other configurations, the core retainer may comprise barbed tips, graspers, expanding structures, or other similar means by which the retention of the core can be established. All such core retainers are characterized by their ability to retain the tissue excised by coring, thereby allowing removal of the excised tissue. Further, in embodiments of the core retainer allowing fluid sampling from the interior of the body part, core retainers will be characterized by their ability to penetrate the body part being cored, thereby accessing an internal face of the outer wall of the body part and any fluid reservoir housed within the body part. Other core retainers do not necessarily travel completely through the outer wall of the body part, instead traveling only partially through to retain the core.
[0032] The remote coring assembly of the invention may further comprise a conduit protection sheath. The conduit protection sheath is positioned within the remote coring assembly housing and positioned about the coring tool and the core retainer. This sheath is configured to move slidably within the conduit or cannula of the remote cannulation assembly. The sheath acts to protect the conduit and cannula from the cutting tool and the core retainer.
[0033] The invention also includes a method of using a remote cannulation apparatus and a remote coring apparatus to remotely cannulate a body part. The steps of this method may be varied while producing the same result. A first step of the method is to position the cannula of the remote cannulation assembly adjacent to the body part to be cannulated. In this step, the cannula is pressed against the body part so as to create a seal to prevent leakage of air, blood, or saline solution into or out of the bloodstream. In a next step, the cannulation assembly is flooded with saline or other physiological fluid to remove any air. The coring tool is then attached to the isolation valve and similarly flooded to remove any air. The coring tool is then inserted through the isolation valve in its open configuration and guided through the conduit and cannula to abut the body part.
[0034] At this point the core retainer is advanced into the body part to be cored to hold the tissue to be removed. Then an opening is formed in the body part by cutting a core in the body part with the coring tool while retaining the core with the core retainer. The core may be removed from the body part at this point. The cannula may then be advanced into the hole, replacing the core. The cannula is moved into its desired position. The coring tool and core retainer may then be withdrawn. The core is thus cut using a coring tool positioned within an inside diameter of the cannula. In some embodiments of the invention, the core is cut coaxially with the cannula.
[0035] In methods of the invention using the flexible cuff embodiment of the isolation valve, the method includes additional steps. First, the cannula of the remote cannulation assembly is placed adjacent to the body part to be cannulated. The cannula is pressed against the body part to create a seal to prevent leakage of air, blood, or saline solution into or out of the bloodstream. The cannulation assembly is next flooded with saline or another physiological fluid to remove any air. The flexible cuff isolation valve is attached about the apical ring of the heart on a first end and about an end of the coring tool on another end. The flexible cuff isolation valve and the coring tool are flooded to remove any air. The coring tool is then inserted through the cuff and guided through the conduit and cannula to abut the body part.
