[0304] Using directional drilling techniques, unlined borehole portions are directionally drilled parallel to each other through the trona bed approximately 1 to 2 feet above the bed floor in a north-south orientation (up-dip to down-dip), substantially perpendicular to the first and second tunnels' longitudinal axes. These unlined borehole portions generally have a smaller diameter than the first and second tunnels; for example, these holes may be 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Thus the 1/4 square mile bed of trona which is 10 feet thick is penetrated by 24 boreholes substantially parallel to the bed floor and which are connected at one end to the second lateral tunnel (solvent feeding zone) on the northern (up-dip) boundary and terminate at the other end to the first lateral tunnel (liquor collection zone) on the southern (down-dip) boundary.
[0305] The spacing of these unlined borehole portions is about 100 feet apart, although they may be from 10 to 200 feet apart or more depending upon the optimal pattern for undercut formation determined by experimentation, testing, and numerical modeling.
[0306] Conduits are positioned into these unlined borehole portions. Conduits have a smaller diameter than the boreholes such as for example, 2 to 4 inches diameter. The downhole extremities of these conduits are positioned at some predetermined distance short of the first southern (down-dip) tunnel (collection zone). Initially, this predetermined distance may vary from 10 to 750 feet, such as for example 100 feet. The solvent manifold may be installed on the northern (up-dip) termination of these conduits in such a way that the flow and pressure of the solvent in each individual pipe can be controlled. A solvent (water or an aqueous solution) is then pumped into the conduits through the manifold. The solvent flows through the conduits from the surface to their downhole extremities at low head of pressure. The solvent immediately comes in contact with the trona contained in the unlined borehole walls at which point dissolution of the trona begins to occur. As trona near the extremities of the conduits is dissolved, the pregnant solution becomes saturated and exits into the first lateral tunnel (collection zone). This process continues until the dissolved out void area around each conduit extremity increases in circumference sufficiently for the voids at the end of each conduit to connect and form a shallow undercut `slot` at the base of the trona bed of sufficient span that the overburden trona begins to slough off into the undercut slot. Additionally, the bed roof eventually sags down, but it cannot travel any further downward than the trona rubble will allow. As an actively caving undercut slot is created, the undercut slot becomes sufficiently large that the operation of the in situ mining system is allowed to run in steady state, as the process of dissolution, trona sloughing/crushing, and downward roof movement continues until the solvent begins to come into close proximity to the bed roof. At this point, the solvent flow and injection may be stopped in order to move the solvent injection location. For example, the conduits can be mechanically retreated back through the unlined borehole portions or otherwise perforated with a downhole tool in order to expose the solvent to new fresh trona regions, and then the steps of solvent injection, dissolution, trona sloughing/crushing, and downward roof movement are repeated.
[0307] The undercut span, solvent flow, duration, and distance can be adjusted such that, when the conduits may be retracted or perforated to a new location within the unlined borehole portions, the solute will reach full saturation in the pregnant solution before the solvent approaches the ore region in proximity of the roof rock and/or oil shale, where it is then desirable to stop dissolution. Chloride contamination of the so formed liquor is thereby prevented, if desired.
[0308] A production of 1 million metric ton per year of soda ash from such trona bed of 0.25 square mile would require the injection of a total flow rate of roughly 500 cubic meters per hour (m.sup.3/h) of solvent and the extraction of roughly 600 m.sup.3/h of trona-loaded solution. That is to say, that with a pattern of 24 injection points and unlined parallel boreholes, the solvent flow rate per injection point will be from about 20 to about 25 m.sup.3/h. If the diameter of the unlined boreholes is 4 inches, the initial velocity of solvent would be 0.7 m/s. When all expanded boreholes connect laterally, the flow rate would become 0.75 m.sup.3/h m for each `linear meter` in width of the progression of the liquid downwards in the bed. When a layer of 0.25 meter of trona is being dissolved, about 2 centimeters (cm) of insoluble may be left over (with an assay of 92%), possibly creating an insoluble layer of 3 cm in thickness and 33% porosity, hence creating a tortuous flow channel for the liquid of 1 cm high. The speed for the liquid would then be about 2 cm/s. If the hydraulic diameters of these channels in which the liquid flows through such insoluble layer is 2 mm, a slope of 0.4% of the floor would be sufficient to enable a free flowing liquid to move through that zone by gravity.
