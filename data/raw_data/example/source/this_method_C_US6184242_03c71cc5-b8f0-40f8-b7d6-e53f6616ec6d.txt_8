In step 4, a phenylamine compound of formula Ii is prepared by removing the amino-protecting group from compound 32 by treatment with a nucleophile such as a fluoride ion source, e.g., (tetra-n-butyl)ammonium fluoride, in an inert organic solvent including dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether, and the like.
Alternatively, other phenylamine compounds of formula Ii can be prepared by exchanging the --O(CH.sub.2).sub.n Z or --(CH.sub.2).sub.m OY of formula Ii where Y or Z is alkyl or cycloalkyl, with other alkyl groups in the presence of an acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid. The reaction proceeds under an inert atmosphere at reflux temperature. Suitable solvents for the reaction include alcoholic solvents such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol.
Exemplary preparations of compounds of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compounds of formula Ii is described in detail in Examples 15-17.
Scheme J
Scheme J describes an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 is a group represented by formula (C) where X is N, and R.sup.6 is --C(V)NR.sup.8 R9 where V is O or S, from the corresponding intermediate compound of formula Ij. ##STR18##
