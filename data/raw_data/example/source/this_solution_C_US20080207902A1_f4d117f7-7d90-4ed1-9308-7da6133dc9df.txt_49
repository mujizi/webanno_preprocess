Example 323
5-hydroxymethyl-6-(7-methoxy-2-trifluoromethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-y-l)-4,5-dihydro-3-(2H)-pyridazinone
[0998]The compound of Example 322 (60 mg) was dissolved in ethanol (25 mL) and ethyl acetate (25 mL). To this solution, 10% palladium carbon (30 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 hours in a stream of hydrogen gas (1 atm). The insoluble material was removed by filtration through Celite. Evaporation of the solvent and subsequent purification by thin-layer chromatography (silica gel, ethyl acetate:methanol=10:1) afforded the title compound as a pale yellow powder (12 mg).
