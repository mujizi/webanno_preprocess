After the first period of time, the speed of the wash chamber is increased to effect more than a one gravity centrifugal force on the fabric so the fabric will be held against the basket wall. The recirculating spray of concentrated detergent solution is continued against the fabric for a second period of time. This method of spinning the fabric items at a high speed while spraying a highly concentrated detergent solution on the spinning clothes is referred to as a high performance method of washing. In this process, ideally, the amount of highly concentrated detergent solution used is only slightly in excess of the amount required to saturate the clothes at the given rotational speed.
The Applicants have found, however, that occasionally during the high speed spin portion of the wash process described above, one or more of the fabric items being washed will span the entire diameter of the wash basket. This may particularly occur during the washing of large fabric items such as shirts, sheets or towels, wherein at the initiation of high speed spin, one or more of the items are disposed in the wash basket at the center of rotation. As the rotation speed of the wash basket is increased, items within the wash basket are urged radially outward and forced against the peripheral wall of the wash basket. Fabric items disposed at the center of rotation, however, have different portions urged radially outward opposite each other such that the item may span the diameter of the wash basket. This results in poor wash performance because the fabric item spanning the diameter of the wash basket during high speed spin may block the recirculating spray of concentrated detergent solution.
The Applicants have discovered, however, that this problem, labeled "bridging" by the applicants, may be overcome by initially saturating the fabric items with wash liquid while tumbling them prior to high speed spinning. As may be understood by those skilled in the art, when fabric items are tumbled while being saturated with wash liquid, they have a tendency to reduce their volume and roll-up or ball. Rolling-up or balling may be understood to describe the phenomena of fabric items twisting upon themselves during tumbling within a wash basket when the fabric items are saturated. This reduction in volume of the fabric items, therefore, substantially reduces the likelihood that any fabric item may be disposed at the axis of rotation when high speed spin occurs and further the rolled-up condition of the saturated fabric items reduces the likelihood that any fabric items may unroll and span the diameter of the wash basket.
It has been determined, however, that the quantity of water required to fully saturate the fabric items tumbling within the wash basket, ordinarily substantially exceeds the amount of water desired for mixing with a detergent for creating a concentrated detergent wash liquor for use in a high performance method of washing. The amount of water required for fully saturating the fabric items while tumbling would require an undesirably large amount of detergent to create the desired concentration of detergent wash liquor. Therefore, it would be highly desirable if a method and apparatus were provided for fully saturating fabric items tumbling in a wash basket prior and using only a portion of the water used for saturating the fabric items to form a concentrated wash liquor for use in the high performance method of washing.
Accordingly, the present invention contemplates a wash system having a rotatable wash basket for receiving fabric items disposed within an imperforate wash tub. A quantity of water is initially applied to the fabric items while the fabric items are tumbled within the wash basket until the fabric items are fully saturated with water and have had a chance to roll-up. The water is then extracted from the fabric items and the extracted water is stored for later use in a holding tank. A portion of the stored water is then sent from the holding tank to a mixing tank and mixed with detergent to form a wash liquor having a detergent concentration within a predetermined concentration range. This wash liquor is then continuously passed through the fabric items while the wash basket rotates at a speed to maintain the fabric items against a peripheral wall of the wash basket.
