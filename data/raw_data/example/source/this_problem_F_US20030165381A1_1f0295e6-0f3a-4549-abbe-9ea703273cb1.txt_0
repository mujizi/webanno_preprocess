[0002] In a gas turbine, in each case a heat shield is arranged axially between two adjacent guide blades, this heat shield being fastened via a heat shield carrier to a stator or to the casing of the gas turbine. A corresponding construction also results for a rotor of the gas turbine, in which construction a heat shield may likewise be arranged between two adjacent rotor blades, this heat shield being fastened to the rotor by means of a heat shield carrier. The guide blades of the stator and the rotor blades of the rotor normally have a root which is designed as a blade carrier and with which the respective blade is anchored in the stator or the rotor. In this case, the blades of the gas turbine are arranged in a hot gas space of the gas turbine, hot gases flowing through this hot gas space during operation of the gas turbine. To cool the heat shield, a cooling space, to which a cooling gas is admitted or through which a cooling gas flows during operation of the gas turbine, is formed between heat shield carrier and heat shield. A gap which is open toward the hot gas space and thus communicates with the latter is normally formed axially between a heat shield carrier and an adjacent blade carrier. In order to now prevent a gas exchange between the cooling space and the hot gas space, gap seals of the type mentioned at the beginning are used. For this purpose, a sealing body of the gap seal can be retained on the heat shield, on the one hand, and on the heat shield carrier, on the other hand, as a result of which effective sealing of the cooling space relative to the gap and thus relative to the hot gas space can be achieved.
[0003] The invention, as characterized in the claims, deals with the problem of specifying an improved embodiment for a gap seal of the type mentioned at the beginning, this improved embodiment permitting in particular improved cooling.
[0004] According to the invention, this problem is solved by the subject matter of the independent claim. Advantageous embodiments are the subject matter of the dependent claims.
[0005] The invention is based on the general idea of retaining the sealing body, on its side facing away from the heat shield, not on the heat shield carrier but on the adjacent blade carrier. By this type of construction, the gap between blade carrier and heat shield carrier is subdivided into a section communicating with the hot gas space and a section separated therefrom by the sealing body. Since no hot gases can enter from the hot gas space in that section of the gap which is separated from the hot gas space, the blade carrier and the heat shield carrier in this gap section are only subjected to reduced thermal loading. Accordingly, the cooling requirement decreases, or an improved cooling effect can be achieved with the same cooling capacity. In addition, the heat shield is normally not attached to the heat shield carrier in a gas-tight manner, so that cooling gas can penetrate into the gap from the cooling space. This leakage results in an additional cooling effect for the blade carrier and the heat shield carrier.
[0006] According to a preferred embodiment, the heat shield and the heat shield carrier may have at least one passage which connects the cooling space in a communicating manner with a gap, formed axially between heat shield carrier and blade carrier, at a location sealed off from the hot gas space by the sealing body. In this way, the gap section separated from the hot gas space can be specifically supplied with cooling gas, as a result of which the cooling of blade carrier and heat shield carrier is improved.
