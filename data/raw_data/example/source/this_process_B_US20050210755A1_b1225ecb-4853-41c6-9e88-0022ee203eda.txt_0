[0079] A substrate can then be prepared as a solid sintered metal, partially sintered mass, or unsintered green body. The substrate can be preformed and then placed on the mixture 22b, or can be formed in situ by placing unsintered powder in the reaction cup 24. Additionally, as shown in FIG. 5A, the substrate 34a can also have a plurality of features on one or both opposing surfaces. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 5B, the substrate 34b can be a standard substrate having substantially planar surfaces.
[0080] As shown in FIG. 6A, the substrate 34a can then be placed against the mixture 22b forming a portion of the precursor assembly. Similarly, as shown in FIG. 6B, the substrate 34b can be placed against the mixture 22b to form a portion of the precursor assembly. The process as described in connection with FIGS. 2 through 4 can be repeated to form a two layered assembly. The second two layered assembly can then be combined with the portion of FIGS. 6A or 6B to form a precursor assembly 10b and 10c , as shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, respectively.
[0081] This process can also be repeated multiple times in order to form multi-layered compacts and tools as described herein. Additionally, the formation of the plurality of features at each interface can be tailored to a specific tool. Thus, some interfaces can be substantially planar. Typically, at least the interface between the working layer and the intermediate layer will be contoured. Alternatively, or in addition to, each contoured interface can differ from other contoured interfaces in shape, concentration, etc. Thus, for example, a first interface can have a plurality of pyramids, while a second interface can have a plurality of mounds.
[0082] Most preferably, the powdered mixtures used in formation of the precursor assembly are substantially free of organic material as such organic materials can interfere with formation of a high quality product through introduction of defects and weaker graphitic carbon deposits.
[0083] Referring again to FIGS. 1A, 7A, and 7B, the precursor assembly 10a, 10b, and 10c, respectively, can be placed in an HPHT apparatus such as a belt-type press, multi-anvil apparatus, bar-type apparatus, toroid apparatus, or any other HPHT apparatus capable of achieving pressures and temperatures sufficient to cause superabrasive bonding and/or growth. Upon heating at high pressures, the superabrasive particles in the superabrasive layers are bonded together to form polycrystalline layers. In one aspect of the present invention, the polycrystalline layers include superabrasives bonded together by sintering. The final sintered polycrystalline layers will have a thickness which, of course, will be slightly thinner than the pre-sintered thickness. Those skilled in the art are well acquainted with taking these changes in dimension into account in designing appropriate molds and determining appropriate thicknesses of each layer in the precursor to achieve desired final dimensions.
