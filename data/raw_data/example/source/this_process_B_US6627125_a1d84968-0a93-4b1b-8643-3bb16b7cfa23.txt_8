In this preferred embodiment a first light transmitting layer 120 and color pattern layer 100 are manufactured using first and second masters 110 and 20 as shown in FIG. 4(A) to FIG. 5(A) according to the second embodiment of the invention. A third master 300 as shown in FIG. 11(A) is also prepared.
A light blocking recess 302 is formed in the third master 300. The shape of the light blocking recess 300 in plan view is that of a black matrix used in an LCD panel, segmenting areas corresponding to a plurality of pixels. It should be noted that the pattern of this black matrix corresponds to the mosaic, delta, striped, or other pixel arrangement. The light blocking recess 302 of the third master 300 is filled with a light blocking material 252 to form light blocking layer 350. This is identical to the process described above with reference to FIG. 10(A).
The lens 124 side of the light transmitting layer 120 and the light blocking layer 350 side of the third master 300 are then bonded with a second light transmitting layer precursor 312 disposed therebetween as shown in FIG. 11(B). This process is identical to the process for bonding by way of intervening light transmitting layer precursor 32 described in the first embodiment, and light transmitting layer precursor 312 can also be selected from any of the materials usable for the light transmitting layer precursor 32 in the first embodiment.
A second light transmitting layer 310 as shown in FIG. 12(A) is formed by thus spreading the second light transmitting layer precursor 312 and then applying an appropriate setting process.
The first master 110 is then separated from the first light transmitting layer 120 and color pattern layer 100 as shown in FIG. 12(B). The third master 300 is also separated from the second light transmitting layer 310 and light blocking layer 350. The result is optical substrate 4.
