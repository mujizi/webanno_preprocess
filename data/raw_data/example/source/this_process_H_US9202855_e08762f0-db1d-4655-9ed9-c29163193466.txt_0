FIG. 3 is a view illustrating reflection of light when the polarizing plate is removed in the display panel shown in FIG. 2.
Incident light 300a, 300b and 300c input from the outside are reflected as indicated by reference numerals 310a, 310b, 310c, 310d and 310e due to a characteristic of metal material of the pixel electrode 280, the source/drain electrode 230, the active layer 210 and the gate 220. In addition, since a color filter is not formed in the white subpixel area 252, reflectance of the external light, which is reflected by the pixel electrode 280, in the white subpixel area 252 is higher than that of the external light in the RGB areas 251, 253 and 254. The incident light 300a, 300b and 300c input from the outside are non-polarized light. The non-polarized light is reflected in the TFT area of the white subpixel area, and is output to the outside of the display panel.
When an oxide TFT is employed in the display panel, in order to block light input to a TFT, a light shield layer (e.g., material such as MoTi) may be patterned under a TFT channel. For example, the light shield layer may be deposited and patterned under the gate, source and drain electrodes. The TFT area may be referred to as a non-opening portion. An area where light emits to the outside of the display panel may be referred to as a pixel area or an opening portion. The opening portion forms a color filter having a specific color (e.g., red, green and blue, hereinafter, referred to as R, G and B, respectively). The pixel electrode is formed with ITO and the like to face the color filter, and a white OLED and the cathode electrode are deposited to configure the display panel. In this process, there are problems wherein the display panel reflects the external light. Therefore, in order to improve visibility, that is, reduce the reflection of the external light, the polarizing plate or the polarizing film is attached as illustrated in FIG. 2 to induce the low reflection of the external light. That is, since a line, an electrode and the like reflect light, the polarizing plate or the polarizing film is attached. The polarizing plate or the polarizing film reduce transmittance of light generated from the light emitting device in the display panel, thereby reducing luminance efficiency and lifetime of the display panel. However, when the polarizing film or the polarizing film is removed as shown in FIG. 3, since visibility is reduced due to the reflection of the external light, a technique for absorbing the external light and increasing light transmittance of the display panel is necessary. In the embodiment of the invention, a technique is disclosed wherein a light controlling film including a light absorbing layer is deposited on a display panel for absorption and low reflection of external light and a white PhotoResist (PR) is deposited in an opening portion and a non-opening portion for low reflection of the external light which is a non-polarized light in a line area. The white PR is one embodiment of a non-transparent photoresist. A non-transparent photoresist which does not transmit a part of light but transmits light having a wavelength range wider than that of light (i.e, red, green and blue light) transmitted by the RGB color filers is referred to as a white photoresist or a white PR, as a light red, a light blue, a light green or other light colors of photoresist.
That is, the embodiments of the invention are embodiments for reducing reflectance of a panel by depositing the white photoresist which is the non-transparent photoresist in a reflective area such as a line and an electrode of an opening portion and a non-opening portion in the white subpixel area and attaching the light transmittance controlling film in order to reduce the reflectance of the external light.
FIG. 4 is a view illustrating the white subpixel area and a non-white subpixel area according to an embodiment of the invention. FIG. 4 shows WRGB subpixel areas including the white subpixel employing the W-PR according to an embodiment of the invention. The subpixel areas are included in one pixel area 492. The pixel electrode 280 is formed on each subpixel area, and the color filters are formed under the pixel electrode in the subpixel area. The color filters 451, 452, 453 and 454 are formed in the subpixel area.
