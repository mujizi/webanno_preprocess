Polyether oligomers are preferred for use in the present invention, for several major reasons. First, a wide range of reactive PEO, PPO and PTMO oligomers with number average molecular weights ranging from 200 to 10,000 g/mole are available. Second, PEO, PPO and PTMO have solubility parameters which are, respectively, 24.5 (J/cm.sup.3).sup.1/2, 23.5 (J/cm.sup.3).sup.1/2 and 18.6 (J/cm.sup.3).sup.1/2 which are in between that of PDMS and urea. Third, for polyether oligomers, reasonably strong hydrogen bonding interaction occurs between ether and urea groups, leading to the formation of a non-sharp interface in these copolymers. In FIG. 1, a schematic representation of the microphase morphology that is expected to form in these systems is shown. Critical parameters, which may have strong influence on controlling the structure and nature of the interface to be formed include: (i) type of the polyether used (PEO, PPO, PTMO or their copolymer) (ii) average molecular weight of the polyether (control of interface thickness), (iii) amount of the ether groups incorporated into the system (control of extent of interaction with urea hard segments), (iv) urea hard segment content of the polymer and (v) average molecular weight of the PDMS oligomer in the copolymers.

The present invention may be better appreciated by considering the following. Mechanical properties and ultimate strength of multiphase copolymers are closely related to their complex, heterogeneous, supramolecular structure. A large number parameters including chemical (bond strength) and structural factors (crystallinity, hydrogen bonding, defects, etc.), processing conditions and thermal history play major roles in determining the microphase morphology of copolymers. For block or segmented copolymers, an especially important parameter, which sometimes may not be recognized as important, is the nature and properties of the interface between the two phases. A sharp transition between two phases with dissimilar properties could create a weak point in a block copolymer. In biological systems (e.g. proteins) this problem is solved by creating a gradient rather than a sharp transition between phases. The present invention may be applied to construct desirable copolymers containing a gradient rather than a sharp transition.
Applications for the present invention include, but are not limited to, e.g., biomaterials; permselective membranes; adhesives; coatings; specialty elastomers; wound dressings; carriers for timed release drug delivery systems; intraocular lenses; etc.
