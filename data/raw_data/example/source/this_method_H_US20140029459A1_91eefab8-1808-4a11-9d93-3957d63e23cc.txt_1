[0194] The subframe #0 of the subsequent radio frame is a PDCCH subframe with respect to the primary serving cell as a scheduling cell. Thus, the conditions for counting the DRX retransmission timer are met. The UE increases the DRX retransmission timer to 1. Also, the conditions for counting the DRX retransmission timer are met in the subframe #1 of the subsequent radio frame. Thus, the UE increases the DRX retransmission timer to 2 in the subframe #1 of the subsequent radio frame.
[0195] Thereafter, the conditions for counting the DRX retransmission timer are not met in all the subframes #2, #3, and #4 of the subsequent radio frame, so the UE maintains the DRX retransmission timer as 2, and increases the value of the DRX retransmission timer to 3 in the subframe #5.
[0196] FIG. 13 is a view illustrating an operation of performing counting of a DRX retransmission timer by a UE according to another embodiment of the present invention. In this method, a subframe in which a PDSCH is not received in a serving cell in which HARQ retransmission takes place is excluded in counting the DRX retransmission timer.
[0197] Referring to FIG. 13, a primary serving cell Pcell and a secondary serving cell SCell are configured in a UE. The TDD UL/DL configuration #5 (conf 5) is allocated to the primary serving cell, and the TDD UL/DL configuration #0 (conf 0) is allocated to the secondary serving cell. It is assumed that a period of a DRX cycle is 8 ms and a third expiration value regarding the DRX retransmission timer is set to psf5. PDCCH subframes are subframes #0, #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, and #9 and subframes #0, #1, #3, #4, and #5 in a subsequent radio frame.
[0198] The primary serving cell is a scheduling cell with respect to the secondary serving cell, and the UE receives a PDCCH for the secondary serving cell on the primary serving cell of the subframe #0. The UE checks whether the PDCCH received through the primary serving cell indicates the presence of DL data transmission. The UE checks whether there is a carrier indicator field (CIF) in the PDCCH. When the CIF exists, the UE ascertains that the PDCCH serves for the secondary serving cell on the basis of the CIF. Thereafter, the UE starts the HARQ RTT timer related to a specific HARQ process according to HARQ entity information in the PDCCH.
