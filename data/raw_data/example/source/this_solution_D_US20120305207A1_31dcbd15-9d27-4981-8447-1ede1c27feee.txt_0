[0032] Pumping or blowing the digested wood chips through a valve along with dilution to obtain a pulp suspension of certain consistency in a storage tank.
[0033] Washing to separate lignin and hemicelluloses from cellulose pulp in several stages.
[0034] The first process step is "cooking", element 1 in FIG. 2, which fractionates the lignocellulosic material components to allow easy downstream removal; specifically lignin and hemicelluloses are dissolved. Cellulose is separated but remains resistant to hydrolysis. Lignin is partially sulfonated rendering it alcohol and water soluble form. Lignocellulosic material is processed, "cooked", in a vapor phase of aliphatic alcohol, water, and sulfur dioxide where typical ratios by weight are 40-60% of both aliphatic alcohol and water, and 9-50% of sulfur dioxide, and preferably 40% aliphatic alcohol, 40% water and 20% sulfur dioxide; this solution is termed cooking liquor. Aliphatic alcohols can include ethanol, methanol, propanol and butanol, but preferably ethanol. The cooking may be performed in one or more stages using batch or continuous digesters. Depending on the lignocellulosic material to be processed, the cooking conditions are varied, with temperatures from 65.degree. C. to 160.degree. C., for example 65.degree. C., 75.degree. C., 85.degree. C., 95.degree. C., 105.degree. C., 115.degree. C., 125.degree. C., 130.degree. C. 135.degree. C., 140.degree. C. 145.degree. C., 150.degree. C., 155, 160.degree. C. and corresponding pressures from 1 atmosphere to 20 atmospheres. The sulfur dioxide charge in the cooking liquor is varied between 9% and 50%, for example 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19,%, 20% 25%, 30, 35%, 40, 45% and 50% of the total cooking liquor mass in one or more cooking stages. Cooking time of each stage is also varied between 1 minutes and 180 minutes, for example 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 140, 160, 180 minutes. The lignocellulosic material to cooking liquor ratio can is varied between 1:1 to 1:4, for example, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, or 1:4, and preferably 1:2.
[0035] Hydrolyzate from the cooking step is subjected to pressure reduction, either at the end of a cook in a batch digester, or in an external flash tank after extraction from a continuous digester. The flash vapor from the pressure reduction is collected and recompressed for reuse in the digester vessel. The flash vapor contains substantially all the unreacted sulfur dioxide. The cellulose is then removed to be washed and further treated as required.
[0036] The process washing step, element 2 in FIG. 1, recovers the hydrolyzate from the cellulose. Cellulose removed in the washing step can be diverted for papermaking or in a preferred embodiment can be bleached into paper furnish.
