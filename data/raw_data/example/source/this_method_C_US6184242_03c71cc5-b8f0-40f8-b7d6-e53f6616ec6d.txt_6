In step 4, an aminocarbonylbenzyl-nitrobenzene 25 is prepared by reacting compound 24 with a primary or secondary amine. The reaction proceeds in the presence of a base such as pyridine in an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane or tetrahydrofuran.
In step 5, a phenylamine compound of formula Ig is prepared by reducing the nitro group of compound 25 to an amino group. Suitable nitro group reducing conditions include hydrogenation with a platinum or palladium catalyst in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol.
An exemplary preparation of a compound of Formula I by this method from the corresponding compound of formula Ig is described in detail in Example 13.
Scheme H
Scheme H describes an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I where R.sup.1 is a group represented by formula (B) where X is S; and R.sup.5 is or --(CH.sub.2).sub.n Z or --(CH.sub.2).sub.m OY, in particular where m is an integer 0, from the corresponding intermediate 5 compounds of formula Ih. ##STR16##
