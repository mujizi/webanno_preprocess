Example 199
6-(2-ethyl-6-fluoro-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-4-yl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(-2H)-pyridazinone
[0587]The compound of Example 193 (680 mg) was dissolved in ethanol (10 ml) and water (10 mL). To this solution, potassium hydroxide (326 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours under reflux. Subsequently, water and several droplets of concentrated hydrochloric acid were added and the mixture was extracted three times with ethylacetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting solid product (579 mg) was dissolved in ethanol (18 mL) and the solution was stirred for 17 hours under reflux. This was followed by addition of hydrazine monohydrate (262 .mu.L) and stirring for 1.5 hours under reflux. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure and purification by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=4:1 then 1:1) afforded the title compound as a yellow powder (359 mg).
