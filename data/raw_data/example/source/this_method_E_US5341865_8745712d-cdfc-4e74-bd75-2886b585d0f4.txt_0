If reference is now made to FIG. 2, there is shown therein a head rail 40 in which is mounted a tilt roll support 42 with the tilt roll 10. The tilt roll support includes end walls 44,46 having second bearings 48 (only the one end wall 46 being visible in FIG. 2) in which the bearing portions 20,22 engage. Again bearing portion 22 only can be seen in FIG. 2. The support also includes side walls 50,52 (see FIGS. 3 and 4) including guide means 54,56 having guide surfaces 58,60 formed in a downwardly extending portion 62 engaged in an aperture 64 in the bottom wall of the head rail 40. It will be seen that the guide surfaces 58,60 are closely adjacent the first and second sides of the support, that is to say they are spaced as far apart as is practically possible.
FIG. 3 illustrates a ladder lace 66 having first and second laterally spaced elongate flexible cords 68,70 and a plurality of longitudinally spaced, transversely extending rungs 72 joining these cords 68,70 and shown supporting slats 74. The cords 68,70 pass one on each side of the tilt roll 10 and pass over the top. The spikes 28,30 are used to be pressed with their sharp ends through the cords 68,70, that is to say either through the cords themselves or through loops formed in the cords adjacent the rungs 72. Especially at the location of the junction of a rung and cord there is a natural looseness of braiding which allows easy insertion of the spike.
It can be seen that the support 42 is also provided with a resilient tongue 76 which is positioned to retain a tilt rod 80 which is passed through the tilt roll, a flat 78 on the tilt roll 80 engaging the flat surface 27 of the notch 26 formed in the central wall of the tilt roll 24. The shoulders 36,38 retain the spiked cord so that it cannot fall off. It will be appreciated that this method of mounting is very simple and that the tilt roll can readily be manufactured as a molding from a plastics material and the design is such as to enable one to use a relatively inexpensive two part mold for this purpose.
It will be observed that the depth, that is to say the vertical dimension as shown in FIG. 3, of the tilt roll 10 is relatively small compared with its width, as shown being approximately half the width.
If reference is made to FIG. 4, in which the blind is shown in its closed position, it will be seen that the configuration of the tilt body ensures that the lever arm 75 is relatively short to produce a tilt load which is reduced as compared with normal at this point of highest loading.
