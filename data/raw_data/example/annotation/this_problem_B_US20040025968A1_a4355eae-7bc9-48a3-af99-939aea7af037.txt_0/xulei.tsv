#Text=The effect in a single case of spillage is small, but when multiplied by the large number of off-road gasoline-powered engines, some of which are refueled several times a day, the effects on air quality are significant.
#Text=[0009] Some states, notably California and Massachusetts, now require that portable gasoline containers sold in their states be un-vented, and equipped with an automatic shutoff spout which is spill-proof and able to capture fuel vapor as it is displaced from the fuel tanks of off-road, internal combustion engines by the incoming liquid fuel.
