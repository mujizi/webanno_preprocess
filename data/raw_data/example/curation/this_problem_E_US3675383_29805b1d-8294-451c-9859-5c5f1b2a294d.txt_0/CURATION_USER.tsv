#Text=These panels are usually rectangular -- a standard size, for example, being 4 .times. 12 feet.
2-1	167-172	These	_	
2-2	173-179	panels	_	
2-3	180-183	are	_

#Text=The surfaces along the longer edges are usually recessed for receiving tape.
3-1	262-265	The	_	
3-2	266-274	surfaces	_	
3-3	275-280	along	_	
3-4	281-284	the	_

3-12	333-337	tape	_	
3-13	337-338	.	_	

#Text=Thus, the finished wall surface along these edges is normally smooth and flat.

#Text=It has been customary in the art to butt these edges on a joist to which both panels can be secured by nailing or adhesive.

#Text=It has been proposed in the past to obviate this problem by forming the joint between joists while bending the ends of the panels inwardly at the joint to form a depression which can then be built out to the wall surface.
